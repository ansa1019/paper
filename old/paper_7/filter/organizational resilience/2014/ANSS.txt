item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ansys, inc.'s results for the year ended december 31, 2014 reflect growth in revenue of 8.7%, operating income of 7.9% and diluted earnings per share of 4.7% as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the company experienced higher revenue in 2014 from growth in both license and maintenance revenue. the increase in revenue was partially offset by increased operating expenses, including higher salaries and additional operating expenses related to the company's 2014 acquisitions. the net overall strengthening of the u.s. dollar resulted in decreased revenue of $7.6 million and decreased operating income of $5.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. an $11.0 million tax benefit in 2013 did not recur in 2014, which adversely impacted earnings per share growth from 2013 to 2014.
the company's non-gaap results for the year ended december 31, 2014 reflect growth in revenue of 8.7%, operating income of 6.8% and diluted earnings per share of 4.9% as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the non-gaap results exclude the income statement effects of the acquisition accounting adjustment to deferred revenue, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations. for further disclosure regarding non-gaap results, see the section titled "non-gaap results" immediately preceding the section titled "liquidity and capital resources".
during the year ended december 31, 2014, the company repurchased 2,976,885 shares of treasury stock for $233.8 million at an average price of $78.54 per share. the company's financial position includes $788.8 million in cash and short-term investments, and working capital of $645.4 million as of december 31, 2014.
on april 30, 2014, the company completed the acquisition of spaceclaim, a leading provider of 3-d modeling technology. under the terms of the agreement, ansys acquired spaceclaim for a purchase price of $85.0 million, which was paid almost entirely in cash, plus retention vehicles and an adjustment for working capital. the operating results of spaceclaim have been included in the company's consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.
in february 2014, the company received a $26.8 million refund related to its 2009 and 2010 federal income tax returns. the company received notice from the internal revenue service in 2013 that the joint committee on taxation took no exception to the company's tax returns that were filed for 2009 and 2010.

the company's revenue increased 8.7% during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, including increases in all major revenue categories. the growth was partially influenced by benefits from the company's continued investment in its global sales and marketing organization. revenue from lease licenses increased 6.8% as compared to the prior year due primarily to growth in lease license revenue of power analysis and electronics products. perpetual license revenue, which is derived primarily from new sales, increased 6.6% as compared to the prior year. annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 12.2%.
with respect to revenue, on average for the year ended december 31, 2014, the u.s. dollar was 1.6% stronger, when measured against the company's primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended december 31, 2013. the net overall strengthening resulted in decreased revenue of $7.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the impact on revenue was primarily driven by $9.8 million of adverse impact due to a weakening japanese yen, partially offset by $1.9 million of favorable impact due to a strengthening british pound. the net overall strengthening of the u.s. dollar also resulted in decreased operating income of $5.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013.
a substantial portion of the company's license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts. these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal. in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts, a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts. as a result of the significant recurring revenue base, the company's license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period. to the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts is high, incremental lease contracts, and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses, will result in license and maintenance revenue growth. conversely, if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors, the company's license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized.
international and domestic revenues, as a percentage of total revenue, were 65.8% and 34.2%, respectively, during the year ended december 31, 2014, and 66.1% and 33.9%, respectively, during the year ended december 31, 2013. the company derived 24.9% and 25.3% of its total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
in valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of the company's recent acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates, the company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, resulting in a reduction of deferred revenue as compared to its historical carrying amount. as a result, the company's post-acquisition revenue will be less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by ansys and its subsidiaries absent the acquisitions. the impact on reported revenue for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $5.4 million. the expected impact on reported revenue is $1.2 million for the year ending december 31, 2015.

software licenses: the increase in costs of software licenses was primarily due to the following:
•   spaceclaim-related costs of software licenses of $0.8 million for the period from the acquisition date (april 30, 2014) through december 31, 2014.
•   increased salaries of $0.6 million.
amortization: the decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a net decrease in amortization of acquired technology, partially offset by an increase in trade name amortization.
maintenance and service: the increase in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following:
•   increased salaries of $3.0 million.
•   increased third-party technical support of $1.0 million.
the improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in related cost of sales.

•   increased salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount-related costs of $9.8 million, primarily due to an increase in headcount.
•   spaceclaim-related selling, general and administrative costs of $4.6 million for the period from the acquisition date (april 30, 2014) through december 31, 2014.
•   increased severance costs of $3.2 million.
•   reaction design-related selling, general and administrative costs of $2.3 million for the period from the acquisition date (january 3, 2014) through december 31, 2014.
•   increased third-party commissions of $2.1 million.
the company anticipates that it will continue to make targeted investments in its global sales and marketing organization and its global business infrastructure to enhance major account sales activities and to support its worldwide sales distribution and marketing strategies, and the business in general.
research and development: the increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following:
•   increased salaries and other headcount-related costs of $5.9 million, primarily due to an increase in headcount.
•   spaceclaim-related research and development costs of $2.3 million for the period from the acquisition date (april 30, 2014) through december 31, 2014.
•   reaction design-related research and development costs of $2.3 million for the period from the acquisition date (january 3, 2014) through december 31, 2014.
•   increased stock-based compensation of $1.2 million.
the company has traditionally invested significant resources in research and development activities and intends to continue to make investments in this area, particularly as it relates to expanding the capabilities of its flagship products and other products within its broad portfolio of simulation software, the evolution of its ansys® workbenchtm platform, integrated multiphysics, expanding its hpc capabilities, an immersive user interface, robust design and ongoing integration of acquired technology.
amortization: the increase in amortization expense was primarily due to a net increase in amortization of customer lists, partially offset by a net decrease in amortization of contract backlog.
interest expense: the company's interest expense consists of the following:
amortization of debt financing costs           -                     149
interest income: interest income for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $3.0 million as compared to $2.8 million during the year ended december 31, 2013. interest income increased as a result of an increase in the company's average invested cash balances.
other expense, net: the company's other expense consists of the following:
income tax provision: the company recorded income tax expense of $93.4 million and had income before income taxes of $348.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, representing an effective tax rate of 26.8%. during the year ended december 31, 2013, the company recorded income tax expense of $77.2 million and had income before income taxes of $322.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 23.9%.
in december 2013, the company received notice from the irs that the joint committee on taxation took no exception to the company's tax returns that were filed for 2009 and 2010. an $11.0 million tax benefit was recognized in the company's 2013 financial results as the company had effectively settled uncertainty regarding the realization of refund claims filed in connection with the 2009 and 2010 returns.
in the u.s., which is the largest jurisdiction where the company receives such a tax credit, the availability of the research and development credit expired at the end of the 2011 tax year. in january 2013, the u.s. congress passed legislation that reinstated the research and development credit retroactive to 2012. the income tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2013 includes approximately $2.3 million related to the reinstated research and development credit for 2012 activity. the research and development credit also expired at the end of the 2013 tax year, but the u.s. congress reinstated the credit in december 2014 for the 2014 tax year.
the increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to the release of an uncertain tax position and the reinstatement of the u.s. research and development credit mentioned above impacting the prior year rate. when compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate, the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 were favorably impacted by the domestic manufacturing deduction and tax benefits associated with the merger of the company's japan subsidiaries in 2010. the rates were also favorably impacted by the recurring item of lower statutory tax rates in many of the company's foreign jurisdictions. the relative amount of income earned in foreign jurisdictions is expected to be fairly consistent in the near term.
net income: the company's net income for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $254.7 million as compared to net income of $245.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. diluted earnings per share was $2.70 for the year ended december 31, 2014 and $2.58 for the year ended december 31, 2013. the weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 94.2 million and 95.1 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

the company's revenue increased 7.9% in 2013 as compared to 2012, including increases in all major revenue categories. the company's revenue included esterel operations for the full year in 2013 of $18.8 million as compared to five months in 2012 of $3.3 million. the growth was partially influenced by benefits from the company's continued investment in its global sales and marketing organization. annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 12.2%. revenue from lease licenses increased 6.6% as compared to the prior year due to an increase in power-analysis-related lease license revenue and growth in sales of other lease licenses. perpetual license revenue, which is derived entirely from new sales during the period, increased 3.9% as compared to the prior year, due to increased perpetual license sales across most product lines, as well as a full year of esterel activity in 2013 as compared to five months in 2012. service revenue increased 12.5% as compared to the prior year due to an increase in engineering consulting projects.
with respect to revenue, on average for the year ended december 31, 2013, the u.s. dollar was 4.0% stronger, when measured against the company's primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended december 31, 2012. the net overall strengthening, primarily related to the japanese yen, resulted in decreased revenue and operating income during 2013, as compared to 2012, of $17.6 million and $12.2 million, respectively.
international and domestic revenues, as a percentage of total revenue, were 66.1% and 33.9%, respectively, during the year ended december 31, 2013, and 66.7% and 33.3%, respectively, during the year ended december 31, 2012. the company derived 25.3% and 26.0% of its total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
in valuing deferred revenue on the esterel and apache design, inc. ("apache") balance sheets as of their respective acquisition dates, the company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, resulting in lower amounts of revenue than esterel and apache would have recognized absent the acquisitions. the impact on reported revenue for the year ended december 31, 2013 was $4.6 million.

software licenses: the increase in costs of software licenses was primarily due to the following:
•   increased salaries and incentive compensation of $2.2 million.
•   increased third-party royalties of $0.9 million.
•   increased esterel-related costs of $0.7 million, primarily as a result of a full year of esterel activity in 2013 as compared to five months of activity in 2012.
amortization: the decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a net decrease in amortization of acquired technology.
maintenance and service: the increase in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following:
•   increased salaries and headcount-related costs of $2.6 million.
•   increased third-party technical support of $1.4 million.
•   increased esterel-related costs of $0.6 million, primarily as a result of a full year of esterel activity in 2013 as compared to five months of activity in 2012.
•   increased depreciation expense of $0.5 million.
the improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in related cost of sales.

•   increased stock-based compensation of $1.6 million.
research and development: the increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following:
•   increased salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount-related costs of $11.0 million, primarily due to an increase in headcount.
•   increased esterel-related expenses of $3.1 million, primarily as a result of a full year of esterel activity in 2013 as compared to five months of activity in 2012.
•   increased facilities and it-related maintenance costs of $1.7 million.
•   increased stock-based compensation of $1.4 million.
•   even-related research and development costs of $1.4 million for the period from the acquisition date (april 2, 2013) through december 31, 2013.
amortization: the decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a net decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets, including contract backlog and customer lists.
interest expense: the company's interest expense consists of the following:
amortization of debt financing costs         149                     698
interest income: interest income for the year ended december 31, 2013 was $2.8 million as compared to $3.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2012. interest income decreased as a result of a decrease in the average rate of return on invested cash balances.
other expense, net: the company's other expense consists of the following:
income tax provision: the company recorded income tax expense of $77.2 million and had income before income taxes of $322.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, representing an effective tax rate of 23.9%. during the year ended december 31, 2012, the company recorded income tax expense of $90.1 million and had income before income taxes of $293.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 30.7%.
in december 2013, the company received notice from the irs that the joint committee on taxation took no exception to the company's tax returns that were filed for 2009 and 2010. an $11.0 million tax benefit was recognized in the company's 2013 financial results as the company had effectively settled uncertainty regarding the realization of refund claims filed in connection with the 2009 and 2010 returns.
in the u.s., which is the largest jurisdiction where the company receives such a tax credit, the availability of the research and development credit expired at the end of the 2011 tax year. in january 2013, the u.s. congress passed legislation that reinstated the research and development credit retroactive to 2012. the income tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2013 includes approximately $2.3 million related to the reinstated research and development credit for 2012 activity.
the decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to the release of an uncertain tax position mentioned above, the reinstatement of the u.s. research and development credit mentioned above, and cash repatriation activities. when compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate, the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012 were favorably impacted by lower statutory tax rates in many of the company's foreign jurisdictions, the domestic manufacturing deduction and tax benefits associated with the merger of the company's japan subsidiaries in 2010.
net income: the company's net income for the year ended december 31, 2013 was $245.3 million as compared to net income of $203.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. diluted earnings per share was $2.58 for the year ended december 31, 2013 and $2.14 for the year ended december 31, 2012. the weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 95.1 million and 95.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

non-gaap measures management uses non-gaap financial measures (a) to evaluate the company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and spending budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, (e) to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and (f) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and its employees. in addition, many financial analysts that follow the company focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non-gaap financial measures. the company believes that it is in the best interest of its investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non-gaap financial information. moreover, investors have historically requested and the company has historically reported these non-gaap financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
while management believes that these non-gaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-gaap financial measures. these non-gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap, are not reported by all of the company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. the company compensates for these limitations by using these non-gaap financial measures as supplements to gaap financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-gaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measures.
the adjustments to these non-gaap financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
acquisition accounting for deferred revenue and its related tax impact. historically, the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support its strategic and other business objectives. in accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value. although this purchase accounting requirement has no impact on the company's business or cash flow, it adversely impacts the company's reported gaap revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition. in order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results, the company provides non-gaap financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment. the company believes that this non-gaap financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare past and future reports of financial results of the company as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related annual lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods.
amortization of intangibles from acquisitions and its related tax impact. the company incurs amortization of intangibles, included in its gaap presentation of amortization expense, related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years. management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating profit margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. accordingly, management does not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating the performance of the company during the applicable time period after the acquisition, and it excludes such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources. the company believes that these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare past reports of financial results of the company as the company has historically reported these non-gaap financial measures.
stock-based compensation expense and its related tax impact. the company incurs expense related to stock-based compensation included in its gaap presentation of cost of software licenses; cost of maintenance and service; research and development expense and selling, general and administrative expense. although stock-based compensation is an expense of the company and viewed as a form of compensation, management excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating profit margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company. specifically, the company excludes stock-based compensation during its annual budgeting process and its quarterly and annual assessments of the company's and management's performance. the annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby the company allocates resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. additionally, the annual review by the board of directors during which it compares the company's historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stock-based compensation. in evaluating the performance of senior management and department managers, charges related to stock-based compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results. in fact, the company records stock-based compensation expense into a stand-alone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable. in this way, management is able to review, on a period-to-period basis, each manager's performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stock-based compensation. the company believes that these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the company's operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the company's operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in the company's financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.
transaction costs related to business combinations. the company incurs expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, which are included in its gaap presentation of selling, general and administrative expense. these expenses are generally not tax-deductible. management excludes these acquisition-related transaction expenses for the purpose of calculating non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating profit margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company, as it generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of its continuing operations. the company believes that these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the company's operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the company's operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in the company's financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.
non-gaap financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, gaap. the company's non-gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap financial measures, and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap.
the company has provided a reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures as listed below:
gaap reporting measure       non-gaap reporting measure revenue                      non-gaap revenue operating income             non-gaap operating income operating profit margin      non-gaap operating profit margin net income                   non-gaap net income diluted earnings per share   non-gaap diluted earnings per share

cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market mutual funds and deposits held at major banks. short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held by certain foreign subsidiaries of the company with original maturities of three months to one year. the following table presents the company's foreign and domestic holdings of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments:
as of december 31,
(in thousands)              2014        % of total      2013                       % of total domestic            $556,328             70.5   %              $530,680             71.4   %
if the foreign balances were repatriated to the u.s., they would be subject to domestic tax, resulting in a tax obligation in the period of repatriation. in general, it is the practice and intention of the company to repatriate previously taxed earnings and to reinvest all other earnings of its non-u.s. subsidiaries. the amount of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period, the offset to which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the company's consolidated balance sheet.
cash flows from operating activities year ended december 31,                                       change

cash flows from operations increased during the current fiscal year due to increased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of $38.1 million, including a $26.8 million refund related to the company's 2009 and 2010 federal income tax returns, and increased net income (net of non-cash operating adjustments) of $14.2 million.
cash flows from operations increased during the prior fiscal year due to increased net income (net of non-cash operating adjustments) of $39.3 million and decreased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of $4.8 million.
cash flows from investing activities year ended december 31,                                            change
cash used in investing activities increased during the current fiscal year due primarily to increased acquisition-related cash outlays of $98.8 million related to the acquisitions of spaceclaim and reaction design as discussed below, partially offset by decreased capital spending of $2.8 million. the company currently plans capital spending of $25 million to $30 million during fiscal year 2015 as compared to $26.0 million that was spent in 2014. the level of spending will be dependent upon various factors, including growth of the business and general economic conditions.
cash used in investing activities decreased during the prior fiscal year due primarily to decreased acquisition-related cash outlays of $40.9 million and increased capital spending of $4.9 million.
year ended december 31,                                            change
cash used in financing activities increased during the current fiscal year due primarily to increased treasury stock repurchases of $117.7 million, partially offset by decreased principal payments on long-term debt of $53.1 million. the company paid the outstanding balance of its term loan at maturity on july 31, 2013.
cash used in financing activities increased during the prior fiscal year due primarily to increased treasury stock repurchases of $20.7 million, decreased excess tax benefits from stock option exercises of $3.9 million and restricted stock withholding taxes paid in lieu of issued shares of $4.3 million, partially offset by decreased principal payments on long-term debt of $21.3 million.
other cash flow information on february 3, 2015, the company acquired the assets of newmerical technologies international ("nti"), a leading developer of in-flight icing simulation software, for a purchase price of approximately $10.5 million in cash. the acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination. the operating results of nti will be included in the company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and, accordingly, nti's operating results are not included in the financial results presented in this annual report on form 10-k.
on april 30, 2014, the company completed the acquisition of spaceclaim, a leading provider of 3-d modeling technology. under the terms of the agreement, ansys acquired spaceclaim for a purchase price of $85.0 million, which was paid almost entirely in cash. the operating results of spaceclaim have been included in the company's consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.
on january 3, 2014, the company completed the acquisition of reaction design, a leading developer of chemistry simulation software, for a purchase price of $19.1 million in cash. the operating results of reaction design are included in the company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
the company believes that existing cash and cash equivalent balances of $788.1 million, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet the company's working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the next twelve months. the company's cash requirements in the future may also be financed through additional equity or debt financings. there can be no assurance that such financings can be obtained on favorable terms, if at all.
under the company's stock repurchase program, the company repurchased shares as follows:
number of shares repurchased                         2,976,885               1,494,001               1,500,000
as of december 31, 2014, 3.5 million shares remained available for repurchase under the company's stock repurchase program. the company repurchased an additional 0.9 million shares in january 2015, for a total cost of $75.2 million. in february 2015, the company's board of directors increased the number of shares authorized for repurchase to a total of 5.0 million shares under the program.
the company continues to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and believes that the best uses of its excess cash are to invest in the business and repurchase stock in order to both offset dilution and return capital to stockholders in excess of its requirements with the goal of increasing stockholder value. additionally, the company has in the past, and expects in the future, to acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, services and technologies. any future acquisitions may be funded by available cash and investments, cash generated from operations, credit facilities, or the issuance of additional securities.
off-balance-sheet arrangements the company does not have any special-purpose entities or off-balance-sheet financing.
contractual obligations the company's significant contractual obligations as of december 31, 2014 are summarized below:
(in thousands)                                                                                      total            within 1 year           2 - 3 years           4 - 5 years       after 5 years global headquarters operating lease(1)                                                        $49,415                $4,278                 $8,556                $8,556             $28,025
other operating leases(2)                                                                      29,838                10,397                 12,100                 4,603             2,738
(1)   on september 14, 2012, the company entered into a lease agreement for 186,000 square feet of rentable space located in an office facility in canonsburg, pennsylvania, which serves as the company's new headquarters. the lease was effective as of september 14, 2012, but because the leased premises were under construction, the company was not obligated to pay rent until three months following the date that the leased premises were delivered to ansys, which occurred on october 1, 2014. the term of the lease is 183 months, beginning on october 1, 2014. the company shall have a one-time right to terminate the lease effective upon the last day of the tenth full year following the date of possession (december 31, 2024), by providing the landlord with at least 18 months' prior written notice of such termination. the company's lease for its prior headquarters expired on december 31, 2014.
(2)   other operating leases primarily include noncancellable lease commitments for the company's other domestic and international offices as well as certain operating equipment.
(3)   unconditional purchase obligations primarily include software licenses and long-term purchase contracts for network, communication and office maintenance services, which are unrecorded as of december 31, 2014.
(4)   the company has $17.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including estimated interest and penalties, that have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with income tax accounting guidance for which the company is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. as a result, such amounts are excluded from the table above.
(5)   other long-term obligations primarily include deferred compensation of $18.5 million (including estimated imputed interest of $300,000 within 1 year, $450,000 within 2-3 years and $90,000 within 4-5 years), pension obligations of $6.3 million for certain foreign locations of the company and contingent consideration of $2.8 million (including estimated imputed interest of $270,000 within 1 year and $390,000 within 2-3 years).
critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition:  revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts. revenue from perpetual licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized upon delivery of the licensed product and the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys, provided that acceptance has occurred and a signed contractual obligation has been received, the price is fixed and determinable, and collectibility of the receivable is probable. the company determines the fair value of post-contract customer support ("pcs") sold together with perpetual licenses based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately. revenue from pcs contracts is classified as maintenance and service revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
revenue for software lease licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized over the period of the lease contract. typically, the company's software leases include pcs which, due to the short term (principally one year or less) of the company's software lease licenses, cannot be separated from lease revenue for accounting purposes. as a result, both the lease license and pcs are recognized ratably over the lease period. due to the short-term nature of the software lease licenses and the frequency with which the company provides major product upgrades (typically every 12-18 months), the company does not believe that a significant portion of the fee paid under the arrangement is attributable to the pcs component of the arrangement and, as a result, includes the revenue for the entire arrangement within software license revenue in the consolidated statements of income.
the company's apache products are typically licensed via longer term leases of 24-36 months. the company recognizes revenue for these licenses over the term of the lease contract. because the company does not have vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair value of these leases, the company also recognizes revenue from perpetual licenses over the term of the lease contract during the infrequent occurrence of these licenses being sold with apache leases in multiple-element arrangements.
revenue from training, support and other services is recognized as the services are performed. the company applies the specific performance method to contracts in which the service consists of a single act, such as providing a training class to a customer, and the proportional performance method to other service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple acts (for example, both training and consulting). in applying the proportional performance method, the company typically utilizes output-based estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials, and estimates output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract. input-based estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials, utilizing direct labor as the input measure.
the company also executes arrangements through independent channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute the company's software products to end-users of the company's products and services in specified territories. in sales facilitated by channel partners, the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the end-user customer. the company recognizes revenue from transactions with channel partners when the channel partner submits a written purchase commitment, collectibility from the channel partner is probable, a signed license agreement is received from the end-user customer and delivery has occurred, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to the company by the channel partners. this amount includes a fee for pcs that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the end-user, which is based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately, and is recognized over the period that pcs is to be provided. the company does not offer right of return, product rotation or price protection to any of its channel partners.
non-income related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable and accrued expenses. the collection and payment of these amounts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and do not impact reported revenues or expenses.
the company warrants to its customers that its software will substantially perform as specified in the company's most current user manuals. the company has not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support, which the company is already obligated to provide, and consequently, the company has not established reserves for warranty obligations.
the company's agreements with its customers generally require it to indemnify the customer against claims that the company's software infringes third-party patent, copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights. such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industry-standard respects, including the company's right to replace an infringing product. as of december 31, 2014, the company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding. the company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations, and consequently, the company has not established any related reserves.
allowance for doubtful accounts:  the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices from both value and delinquency perspectives. for those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable and the geographic area of origin. in determining these percentages, the company considers its historical collection experience and current economic trends in the customer's industry and geographic region. if the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected.
income taxes: the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date.
the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. in making such determination, the company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. in the event the company determines that it will be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded that would reduce the provision for income taxes.
tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. the company recognizes interest and penalties related to income taxes within the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of income. accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets: the company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually by performing a quantitative assessment of whether the fair value of each reporting unit or asset exceeds its carrying amount. goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested at the individual asset level. this requires the company to assess and make judgments regarding a variety of factors which impact the fair value of the reporting unit or asset being tested, including business plans, anticipated future cash flows, economic projections and other market data. because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors, significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially impact the company's future financial results. during the first quarter of 2014, the company completed the annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and determined that these assets had not been impaired as of the test date, january 1, 2014.
contingencies: the company is involved in various investigations, claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including commercial disputes, labor and employment matters, tax audits, alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters. the company reviews the status of these matters, assesses its financial exposure and records a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation, claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. as a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates, the company may have to revise its estimates as facts and circumstances change. the revision of these estimates could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations.
stock-based compensation: the company grants options and other stock awards to employees and directors under the company's stock option and grant plan. eligible employees can also purchase shares of the company's common stock at a discount under the company's employee stock purchase plan. the benefits provided under these plans are share-based payments subject to the provisions of share-based payment accounting guidance. the company uses the fair value method to apply the provisions of share-based payment accounting guidance. stock-based compensation expense for 2014, 2013 and 2012
was $36.9 million, $35.3 million and $32.4 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2014, total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to unvested stock options granted prior to that date was $21.3 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years.
the value of each stock option award was estimated on the date of grant, or date of acquisition for options issued in a business combination, using the black-scholes option pricing model ("black-scholes model"). the determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards using an option pricing model is affected by the company's stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. these variables include the company's expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. the table below presents the weighted average input assumptions used and resulting fair values for options granted or issued in business combinations during each respective year. the stock-based compensation expense for options is recorded ratably over their requisite service period. the interest rate assumptions were determined by using the five-year u.s. treasury note yield on the date of grant or date of acquisition.
risk-free interest rate                      1.49% to 1.76%          0.68% to 1.48%          0.59% to 1.04%
expected volatility                                     35%                     37%                     38%
prior to 2012, the company issued both non-qualified and incentive stock options; however, the company no longer issues incentive stock options. the tax benefits associated with the outstanding incentive stock options are unpredictable, as they are predicated upon an award recipient triggering an event that disqualifies the award and that then results in a tax deduction to the company.
under the terms of the ansys, inc. long-term incentive plan or in conjunction with an acquisition agreement, the company issues various restricted stock awards which may have a single or combination of a market condition, an operating performance condition or a service condition. restricted stock awards with a service condition or an operating performance condition are valued based on the grant date fair value of the award. stock compensation expense is recognized over the employee's requisite service period for awards with only a service condition. for awards with an operating performance condition, stock-based compensation expense is recorded from the service inception date through the conclusion of the measurement period based on management's estimates concerning the probability of vesting. vesting of restricted stock awards with a market condition or a portion thereof is based on the company's performance as measured by total shareholder return relative to the median percentage appreciation of the nasdaq composite index over a specified measurement period, subject to each participant's continued employment with the company through the conclusion of the measurement period. the fair value of the restricted stock units is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model. the determination of the fair value of the awards is affected by the grant date and a number of variables, each of which has been identified in the chart below for awards granted during each respective period. share-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award is being recorded from the grant date through the conclusion of the measurement period.
risk-free interest rate                                     0.70%              0.35%              0.16%
expected volatility-ansys stock price                         25%                25%                28%
expected volatility-nasdaq composite index                    15%                20%                20%
expected term                                           2.8 years          2.8 years          2.8 years correlation factor                                           0.70               0.70               0.75
the company also grants deferred stock units to non-affiliate independent directors, which are rights to receive shares of common stock upon termination of service as a director. the deferred stock units are issued in arrears and vest immediately.
to the extent the company changes the terms of its stock-based compensation programs, experiences market volatility in the pricing of its common stock that increases the implied volatility assumption used in the black-scholes model, refines different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from current estimates, or assumes stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than the company's stock award arrangements, among other potential impacts, the stock-based compensation expense recorded in future periods and the related tax benefits may differ significantly from what was recorded in previous reporting periods.
estimates of stock-based compensation expense are significant to the company's financial statements, but this expense is based on the aforementioned option valuation models and will never result in the payment of cash by the company. for this reason, and because the company does not view stock-based compensation as related to its operational performance, the board of directors and management exclude stock-based compensation expense when evaluating the company's underlying business performance.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information that management believes is relevant to an understanding and assessment of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of ventas, inc. (together with its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires, "we," "us" or "our"). you should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, as it will help you understand:
•   our company and the environment in which we operate;
•   our 2014 highlights and other recent developments;
•   our results of operations for the last three years;
•   our liquidity and capital resources;
•   our future contractual obligations.
corporate and operating environment we are a real estate investment trust ("reit") with a highly diversified portfolio of seniors housing and healthcare properties located throughout the united states, canada and the united kingdom. as of december 31, 2014, we owned more than 1,500 properties (including properties classified as held for sale), consisting of seniors housing communities, medical
office buildings ("mobs"), skilled nursing and other facilities, and hospitals, and we had one new property under development. we are an s&p 500 company and currently headquartered in chicago, illinois.
we primarily invest in seniors housing and healthcare properties through acquisitions and lease our properties to unaffiliated tenants or operate them through independent third-party managers. as of december 31, 2014, we leased a total of 922 properties (excluding mobs and properties classified as held for sale) to various healthcare operating companies under "triple-net" or "absolute-net" leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures, and we engaged independent operators, such as atria senior living, inc. ("atria") and sunrise senior living, llc (together with its subsidiaries, "sunrise"), to manage 270 of our seniors housing communities (excluding properties classified as held for sale) for us pursuant to long-term management agreements. our two largest tenants, brookdale senior living inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "brookdale senior living") and kindred healthcare, inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "kindred"), leased from us 160 properties (excluding six properties owned through investments in unconsolidated entities and one property managed by brookdale senior living pursuant to a long-term management agreement) and 83 properties, respectively, as of december 31, 2014.
through our lillibridge healthcare services, inc. ("lillibridge") subsidiary and our ownership interest in pmb real estate services llc ("pmbres"), we also provide mob management, leasing, marketing, facility development and advisory services to highly rated hospitals and health systems throughout the united states. in addition, from time to time, we make secured and unsecured loans and other investments relating to seniors housing and healthcare operators or properties.
we conduct our operations through three reportable business segments: triple-net leased properties; senior living operations; and mob operations. see "note 20-segment information" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
as of december 31, 2014, our consolidated portfolio included 100% ownership interests in 1,383 properties and controlling joint venture interests in 50 properties, and we had non-controlling ownership interests in 51 properties through investments in unconsolidated entities. through lillibridge and pmbres, we provided management and leasing services to third parties with respect to 75 mobs as of december 31, 2014.
we aim to enhance shareholder value by delivering consistent, superior total returns through a strategy of: (1) generating reliable and growing cash flows; (2) maintaining a balanced, diversified portfolio of high-quality assets; and (3) preserving our financial strength, flexibility and liquidity.
our ability to access capital in a timely and cost-effective manner is critical to the success of our business strategy because it affects our ability to satisfy existing obligations, including the repayment of maturing indebtedness, and to make future investments. factors such as general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, expectations of our potential future earnings and cash distributions, and the trading price of our common stock that are beyond our control and fluctuate over time all impact our access to and cost of external capital. for that reason, we generally attempt to match the long-term duration of our investments in real property with long-term financing through the issuance of shares of our common stock or the incurrence of long-term fixed rate debt. at december 31, 2014, 21.9% of our consolidated debt (excluding debt related to properties classified as held for sale) was variable rate debt.
2014 highlights and other recent developments
•   in 2014, we paid an annual cash dividend on our common stock of $2.965 per share.
•   during 2014, we made investments totaling approximately $2.4 billion in seniors housing and healthcare assets, including 29 seniors housing communities located in canada that we acquired from holiday retirement (the "holiday canada acquisition"), three high-quality private hospitals located in the united kingdom and a $425.0 million secured mezzanine loan investment that has a blended annual interest rate of 8.1% and has contractual maturities ranging between 2016 and 2019.
•   in january 2015, we acquired publicly traded american realty capital healthcare trust, inc. ("hct") in a stock and cash transaction (the "hct acquisition"), which added 152 properties (some of which are located on the same campus) to our portfolio. we funded the transaction through the issuance of approximately 28.4 million shares of our common stock, 1.1 million limited partnership units that are redeemable for shares of our common stock, cash and the assumption of debt.
•   in 2015, we made other investments totaling approximately $320 million, including the acquisition of five triple-net leased properties in the united kingdom and 12 skilled nursing facilities.
•   in april 2014, we issued and sold $700 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.75% and a weighted average maturity of seven years.
•   in september 2014, we issued and sold cad 650.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, with an effective weighted average interest rate of 3.5% and a weighted average maturity of 6.9 years, on a private placement basis in canada. we used the net proceeds from the sale to repay a portion of the cad 791.0 million unsecured term loan we incurred initially to fund the holiday canada acquisition.
•   in january 2015, we issued and sold $900 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% and a weighted average maturity of 16.7 years, and we issued and sold cad 250.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, with an interest rate of 3.3% and a maturity of seven years, on a private placement basis in canada.
•   under our "at-the-market" equity offering program, during 2014 and 2015 we issued and sold a total of approximately 7.1 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $75.18 per share for aggregate net proceeds (after sales agent commissions) of $528.1 million.
•   during 2014, we sold 22 properties for $118.2 million and received loans receivable repayments of $55.9 million.
•   in 2015, we sold 17 properties for $275.1 million, including $5.5 million of lease termination fees.
•   as of december 31, 2014, we had re-leased to kindred, transitioned to new operators or sold 107 of the 108 licensed healthcare assets whose lease terms with kindred were scheduled to expire on september 30, 2014, and we expect to sell the remaining asset during 2015. see "triple-net lease expirations."
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") set forth in the accounting standards codification ("asc"), as published by the financial accounting standards board ("fasb"). gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. we base these estimates on our experience and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. however, if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, we may have applied a different accounting treatment, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. we periodically reevaluate our estimates and assumptions, and in the event they prove to be different from actual results, we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. we believe that the critical accounting policies described below, among others, affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. for more information regarding our critical accounting policies, see "note 2-accounting policies" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and the joint venture entities over which we exercise control. all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation, and our net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.
gaap requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities ("vies"). a vie is broadly defined as an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about the entity's activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; and (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests, and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. we consolidate our investment in a vie when we determine that we are its primary beneficiary. we may change our original assessment of a vie upon subsequent events such as the modification of contractual arrangements that affects the characteristics or adequacy of the entity's equity investments at risk and the disposition of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary.
we identify the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both: (i) the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could be significant to the entity. we perform this analysis on an ongoing basis.
as it relates to investments in joint ventures, gaap may preclude consolidation by the sole general partner in certain circumstances based on the type of rights held by the limited partner(s). we assess limited partners' rights and their impact on the presumption of control of the limited partnership by the sole general partner when an investor becomes the sole general partner, and we perform a reassessment when there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners, the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership interests, or there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests. we also apply this guidance to managing member interests in limited liability companies.
business combinations we account for acquisitions using the acquisition method and allocate the cost of the businesses acquired among tangible and recognized intangible assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. recognized intangibles primarily include the value of in-place leases, acquired lease contracts, tenant and customer relationships, trade names/trademarks and goodwill. we do not amortize goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business and is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
our method for allocating the purchase price to acquired investments in real estate requires us to make subjective assessments for determining fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. this includes determining the value of the buildings, land and improvements, construction in progress, ground leases, tenant improvements, in-place leases, above and/or below market leases, purchase option intangible assets and/or liabilities, and any debt assumed. these estimates require significant judgment and in some cases involve complex calculations. these allocation assessments directly impact our results of operations, as amounts allocated to certain assets and liabilities have different depreciation or amortization lives. in addition, we amortize the value assigned to above and/or below market leases as a component of revenue, unlike in-place leases and other intangibles, which we include in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of income.
we estimate the fair value of buildings acquired on an as-if-vacant basis and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building, not to exceed 35 years. we determine the allocated value of other fixed assets, such as site improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment, based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over the assets' estimated remaining useful lives as determined at the applicable acquisition date. we determine the value of land either by considering the sales prices of similar properties in recent transactions or based on internal analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio. we generally determine the value of construction in progress based upon the replacement cost. however, for certain acquired properties that are part of a ground-up development, we determine fair value by using the same valuation approach as for all other properties and deducting the estimated cost to complete the development. during the remaining construction period, we capitalize interest expense until the development has reached substantial completion. construction in progress, including capitalized interest, is not depreciated until the development has reached substantial completion.
the fair value of acquired lease-related intangibles, if any, reflects: (i) the estimated value of any above and/or below market leases, determined by discounting the difference between the estimated market rent and in-place lease rent; and (ii) the estimated value of in-place leases related to the cost to obtain tenants, including leasing commissions, and an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rent and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period as if the acquired space was vacant. we amortize any acquired lease-related intangibles to revenue or amortization expense over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any assumed bargain renewal periods. if a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration or not renewed upon expiration, we recognize all unamortized lease-related intangibles associated with that lease in operations at that time.
we estimate the fair value of purchase option intangible assets and liabilities by discounting the difference between the applicable property's acquisition date fair value and an estimate of its future option price. we do not amortize the resulting intangible asset or liability over the term of the lease, but rather adjust the recognized value of the asset or liability upon sale.
we estimate the fair value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired, if any, by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant or customer, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant or customer, the tenant's credit quality, expectations of lease renewals with the tenant, and the potential for significant, additional future leasing arrangements with the tenant, and we amortize that value over the expected life of the associated arrangements or leases, including the remaining terms of the related leases and any expected renewal periods. we estimate the fair value of trade names and trademarks using a royalty rate methodology and amortize that value over the estimated useful life of the trade name or trademark.
in connection with a business combination, we may assume rights and obligations under certain lease agreements pursuant to which we become the lessee of a given property. we assume the lease classification previously determined by the prior lessee absent a modification in the assumed lease agreement. we assess assumed operating leases, including ground
leases, to determine whether the lease terms are favorable or unfavorable to us given current market conditions on the acquisition date. to the extent the lease terms are favorable or unfavorable relative to market conditions on the acquisition date, we recognize an intangible asset or liability, as applicable, at fair value and amortize that asset or liability (excluding purchase option intangibles) to interest or rental expense in our consolidated statements of income over the applicable lease term. we include all lease-related intangible assets and liabilities within acquired lease intangibles and accounts payable and other liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.
we determine the fair value of loans receivable acquired in connection with a business combination by discounting the estimated future cash flows using current interest rates at which similar loans on the same terms with the same length to maturity would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings. we do not establish a valuation allowance at the acquisition date because the estimated future cash flows already reflect our judgment regarding their uncertainty. we recognize the difference between the acquisition date fair value and the total expected cash flows as interest income using an effective interest method over the life of the applicable loan. subsequent to the acquisition date, we evaluate changes regarding the uncertainty of future cash flows and the need for a valuation allowance, as appropriate.
we estimate the fair value of noncontrolling interests assumed consistent with the manner in which we value all of the underlying assets and liabilities.
we base the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities on the fair value of the assets at the time we acquired the joint venture interest. we estimate fair values for our equity method investments based on discounted cash flow models that include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and, where applicable, any estimated debt premiums or discounts. the capitalization rates, discount rates and credit spreads we use in these models are based upon assumptions that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments.
we generally amortize any difference between our cost basis and the basis reflected at the joint venture level over the lives of the related assets and liabilities and include that amortization in our share of income or loss from unconsolidated entities. for earnings of equity method investments with pro rata distribution allocations, net income or loss is allocated between the partners in the joint venture based on their respective stated ownership percentages. in other instances, net income or loss is allocated between the partners in the joint venture based on the hypothetical liquidation at book value method.
we calculate the fair value of long-term debt by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows on each instrument at the current market rate for those borrowings, which we approximate based on the rate at which we would expect to incur a replacement instrument on the date of acquisition, and recognize any fair value adjustments related to long-term debt as effective yield adjustments over the remaining term of the instrument.
impairment of long-lived and intangible assets we periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, primarily consisting of investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. if indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations. in performing this evaluation, we consider market conditions and our current intentions with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. we adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long-lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows, including sales proceeds, is less than book value. we recognize an impairment loss at the time we make any such determination.
if impairment indicators arise with respect to intangible assets with finite useful lives, we evaluate impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. if estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, then we estimate the fair value of the asset and compare the estimated fair value to the intangible asset's carrying value. we recognize any shortfall from carrying value as an impairment loss in the current period.
we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment at least annually, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment may exceed its fair value. if we determine that a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated entity is other-than-temporary, and if such reduced fair value is below the carrying value, we record an impairment. the determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated entities involves significant judgment, and our estimates consider all available evidence, including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates, general economic conditions and trends and other relevant factors.
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually, and more frequently if indicators arise. we first assess qualitative factors, such as current macroeconomic conditions, state of the equity and capital markets and our overall financial and operating performance, to determine the likelihood that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we proceed with the two-step approach to evaluating impairment. first, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the
reporting unit's carrying value. if the carrying value exceeds fair value, we proceed with the second step, which requires us to assign the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test. the excess fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment. we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied value in the current period.
estimates of fair value used in our evaluation of goodwill, investments in real estate and intangible assets are based upon discounted future cash flow projections or other acceptable valuation techniques that are based, in turn, upon various estimates and assumptions, such as revenue and expense growth rates, capitalization rates, discount rates or other available market data. our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows and to estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments. while we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.
loans receivable we record loans receivable, other than those acquired in connection with a business combination, on our consolidated balance sheets (either in secured loans receivable and investments, net or other assets, in the case of unsecured loans receivable) at the unpaid principal balance, net of any deferred origination fees, purchase discounts or premiums and valuation allowances. we amortize net deferred origination fees, which are comprised of loan fees collected from the borrower net of certain direct costs, and purchase discounts or premiums over the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method and immediately recognize in income any unamortized balances if the loan is repaid before its contractual maturity.
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of loans receivable based on factors such as corporate and facility-level financial and operational reports, compliance with financial covenants set forth in the applicable loan agreement, the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantor, the payment history of the borrower and current economic conditions. if our evaluation of these factors indicates it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the terms of the applicable loan agreement, we provide a reserve against the portion of the receivable that we estimate may not be collected.
fair value fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and we determine fair value based on the assumptions that we expect market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, gaap establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within levels one and two of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within level three of the hierarchy).
level one inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access. level two inputs consist of inputs other than quoted prices included in level one that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. level two inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and other inputs for the asset or liability that are observable at commonly quoted intervals, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves. level three inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which typically are based on our own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. if the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the entire fair value measurement falls is the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. if the volume and level of market activity for an asset or liability has decreased significantly relative to the normal market activity for such asset or liability (or similar assets or liabilities), then transactions or quoted prices may not accurately reflect fair value. in addition, if there is evidence that a transaction for an asset or liability is not orderly, little, if any, weight is placed on that transaction price as an indicator of fair value. our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
revenue recognition triple-net leased properties and mob operations certain of our triple-net leases and most of our mob leases provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent. we recognize base rental revenues under these leases on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured. recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis generally results in recognized revenues during the first half of a lease term exceeding the cash amounts contractually due from our tenants, creating a straight-line rent receivable that is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
certain of our leases provide for periodic increases in base rent only if certain revenue parameters or other substantive contingencies are met. we recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases as the related parameters or contingencies are met, rather than on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term.
senior living operations we recognize resident fees and services, other than move-in fees, monthly as services are provided. we recognize move-in fees on a straight-line basis over the average resident stay. our lease agreements with residents generally have terms of 12 to 18 months and are cancelable by the resident upon 30 days' notice.
other we recognize interest income from loans and investments, including discounts and premiums, using the effective interest method when collectibility is reasonably assured. we apply the effective interest method on a loan-by-loan basis and recognize discounts and premiums as yield adjustments over the related loan term. we recognize interest income on an impaired loan to the extent our estimate of the fair value of the collateral is sufficient to support the balance of the loan, other receivables and all related accrued interest. when the balance of the loan, other receivables and all related accrued interest is equal to our estimate of the fair value of the collateral, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. we provide a reserve against an impaired loan to the extent our total investment in the loan exceeds our estimate of the fair value of the loan collateral.
we recognize income from rent, lease termination fees, development services, management advisory services, and all other income when all of the following criteria are met in accordance with securities and exchange commission ("sec") staff accounting bulletin 104: (i) the applicable agreement has been fully executed and delivered; (ii) services have been rendered; (iii) the amount is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured.
allowances we assess the collectibility of our rent receivables, including straight-line rent receivables. we base our assessment of the collectibility of rent receivables (other than straight-line rent receivables) on several factors, including, among other things, payment history, the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors, the value of the underlying collateral, if any, and current economic conditions. if our evaluation of these factors indicates it is probable that we will be unable to recover the full value of the receivable, we provide a reserve against the portion of the receivable that we estimate may not be recovered. we also base our assessment of the collectibility of straight-line rent receivables on several factors, including, among other things, the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors, the historical operations and operating trends of the property, the historical payment pattern of the tenant and the type of property. if our evaluation of these factors indicates it is probable that we will be unable to receive the rent payments due in the future, we provide a reserve against the recognized straight-line rent receivable asset for the portion, up to its full value, that we estimate may not be recovered. if we change our assumptions or estimates regarding the collectibility of future rent payments required by a lease, we may adjust our reserve to increase or reduce the rental revenue recognized in the period we make such change in our assumptions or estimates.
federal income tax we have elected to be treated as a reit under the applicable provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), for every year beginning with the year ended december 31, 1999. accordingly, we generally are not subject to federal income tax on net income that we distribute to our stockholders, provided that we continue to qualify as a reit. however, with respect to certain of our subsidiaries that have elected to be treated as "taxable reit subsidiaries," we record income tax expense or benefit, as those entities are subject to federal income tax similar to regular corporations.
we account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method and recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns. under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. any increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances, and that causes us to change our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events, is included in the tax provision when such changes occur. deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. a valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances, and that causes us to change our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset, is included in the tax provision when such changes occur.
recently issued or adopted accounting standards in 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update 2014-08, reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity ("asu 2014-08"), which raises the threshold for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations. a discontinued operation is defined as: (1) a component of an entity or group of components that has been disposed of or classified as held for sale and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results; or (2) an acquired business that is classified as held for sale on the acquisition date. asu 2014-08 also requires additional disclosures regarding discontinued operations, as well as material disposals that do not meet the definition of discontinued operations. the application of this guidance is prospective from the date of adoption and applies only to disposals (or new classifications to held for sale) that have not been reported as discontinued operations in our previously issued financial statements. we adopted asu 2014-08 during the quarter ended march 31, 2014.
in 2014, the fasb also issued accounting standards update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers ("asu 2014-09"), which outlines a comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. asu 2014-09 states that "an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services." while asu 2014-09 specifically references contracts with customers, it may apply to certain other transactions such as the sale of real estate or equipment. asu 2014-09 is effective for us beginning january 1, 2017. we are continuing to evaluate this guidance; however, we do not expect its adoption to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements, as a substantial portion of our revenue consists of rental income from leasing arrangements, which are specifically excluded from asu 2014-09.
results of operations as of december 31, 2014, we operated through three reportable business segments: triple-net leased properties; senior living operations and mob operations. in our triple-net leased properties segment, we invest in seniors housing and healthcare properties throughout the united states and the united kingdom and lease our properties to healthcare operating companies under "triple-net" or "absolute-net" leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property-related expenses. in our senior living operations segment, we invest in seniors housing communities throughout the united states and canada and engage independent operators, such as atria and sunrise, to manage those communities. in our mob operations segment, we primarily acquire, own, develop, lease, and manage mobs. information provided for "all other" includes income from loans and investments and other miscellaneous income and various corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to our three reportable business segments. assets included in "all other" consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash, restricted cash, deferred financing costs, loans receivable and miscellaneous accounts receivable.
the table below shows our results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 and the effect of changes in those results from period to period on our net income attributable to common stockholders.

triple-net leased properties segment noi increased in 2014 over the prior year primarily due to rent from the properties we acquired during 2014 and 2013, contractual escalations in rent pursuant to the terms of our leases, and increases in base and other rent under certain of our leases.
in our triple-net leased properties segment, our revenues generally consist of fixed rental amounts (subject to annual contractual escalations) received from our tenants in accordance with the applicable lease terms and do not vary based on the underlying operating performance of the properties. therefore, while occupancy rates may affect the profitability of our tenants' operations, they do not have a direct impact on our revenues or financial results. the following table sets forth average continuing occupancy rates related to the triple-net leased properties we owned at december 31, 2014 for the trailing 12 months ended september 30, 2014 (which is the most recent information available to us from our tenants) and average continuing occupancy rates related to the triple-net leased properties we owned at december 31, 2013 for the trailing 12 months ended september 30, 2013.

revenues attributed to our senior living operations segment consist of resident fees and services, which include all amounts earned from residents at our seniors housing communities, such as rental fees related to resident leases, extended
health care fees and other ancillary service income. our senior living operations segment revenues increased in 2014 over the prior year primarily due to the holiday canada acquisition and other seniors housing communities we acquired during 2014 and 2013.
property-level operating expenses related to our senior living operations segment include labor, food, utilities, marketing, management and other costs of operating the properties. property-level operating expenses also increased year over year primarily due to the acquired properties described above.

the increase in our mob operations segment rental income in 2014 over the prior year is attributed primarily to the mobs we acquired during 2014 and 2013 and slightly higher base rents. the increase in our mob property-level operating expenses is due primarily to those acquired mobs and increases in utilities, snow removal, payroll and insurance expenses, partially offset by decreases in operating costs resulting from expense controls.
medical office building services revenue and costs both increased in 2014 over the prior year primarily due to increased construction activity during 2014 compared to 2013.

segment noi-all other all other noi consists solely of income from loans and investments. income from loans and investments decreased in 2014 over the prior year due primarily to final repayments and sales of portions of certain loans receivable throughout 2013.
interest expense the $38.2 million increase in total interest expense, including interest allocated to discontinued operations of $1.7 million and $5.5 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, is attributed primarily to $50.9 million of additional interest due to higher debt balances, partially offset by a $15.6 million reduction in interest due to lower effective interest rates, including the amortization of any fair value adjustments. our effective interest rate was 3.7% for 2014, compared to 3.8% for 2013.
general, administrative and professional fees general, administrative and professional fees increased $6.6 million in 2014 primarily due to our continued organizational growth.
loss on extinguishment of debt, net the loss on extinguishment of debt, net in 2014 resulted primarily from various debt repayments. the loss on extinguishment of debt, net in 2013 resulted primarily from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees as a result of replacing our previous $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a new $3.0 billion unsecured credit facility and the repayment of certain mortgage debt.
merger-related expenses and deal costs merger-related expenses and deal costs in both years consist of transition, integration, deal and severance-related expenses primarily related to pending and consummated transactions required by gaap to be expensed rather than capitalized into the asset value. the $23.4 million increase in merger-related expenses and deal costs in 2014 over the prior year is primarily due to increased 2014 investment activity.
other other primarily includes building rent expense paid to lease certain of our senior living operating communities, as well as certain unreimbursable expenses related to our triple-net leased portfolio. for the year ended december 31, 2014, other also includes expenses related to the re-audit and re-review of our historical financial statements.
income tax benefit income tax benefit for 2014 was due primarily to the income tax benefit of ordinary losses and restructuring related to certain taxable reit subsidiaries ("trs" or "trs entities"). income tax benefit for 2013 was due primarily to the release of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets of one of our trs entities.
discontinued operations discontinued operations for 2014 reflects activity related to 17 properties, 12 of which were sold during 2014, resulting in a net gain of $1.2 million, and five of which were classified as held for sale as of december 31, 2014. discontinued operations for 2013 reflects activity related to 39 properties, 22 of which were sold during 2013, resulting in a net gain of $3.6 million.
gain on real estate dispositions the gain on real estate dispositions in 2014 resulted primarily from the sale of ten properties that are not classified as discontinued operations in accordance with asu 2014-08, resulting in a net gain of $18.0 million. gains on real estate dispositions in 2013 are classified in discontinued operations.
net income/loss attributable to noncontrolling interest net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for 2014 represents our partners' joint venture interests in 51 properties. net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest for 2013 represents our partners' joint venture interests in 58 properties.

the increases in our mob operations segment revenues and property-level operating expenses in 2013 over the prior year are primarily due to our acquisition of cogdell spencer inc. ("cogdell") in april 2012, the august 2012 and march 2013 acquisitions of the controlling interests in 38 mobs that we had previously accounted for as investments in unconsolidated entities and other mobs we acquired during 2013 and 2012.
medical office building services revenue and costs both decreased year over year primarily due to a reduction in construction activity during 2013 compared to 2012 and our acquisitions of the controlling interests in 38 mobs that we had previously accounted for as investments in unconsolidated entities, which reduced our management fee revenue.

segment noi-all other all other noi consists solely of income from loans and investments. income from loans and investments increased in 2013 over the prior year due primarily to $446.0 million aggregate amount of secured loans and other investments we made in december 2012 and thereafter, which had a weighted average effective interest rate of 9.3% at issuance, partially offset by final repayments on and the sales of portions of certain loans receivable throughout 2013.
interest expense the $38.4 million increase in total interest expense, including interest allocated to discontinued operations of $5.5 million and $13.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, is attributed primarily to $55.3 million of additional interest due to higher debt balances, partially offset by a $14.8 million reduction in interest due to lower effective interest rates, including the amortization of any fair value adjustments. our effective interest rate, excluding activity related to our capital leases in 2012, was 3.8% for 2013, as compared to 4.0% for 2012.
general, administrative and professional fees general, administrative and professional fees increased in 2013 primarily due to our continued organizational growth, as a result of the cogdell acquisition and subsequent thereto.
loss on extinguishment of debt, net the loss on extinguishment of debt, net in 2013 resulted primarily from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees as a result of replacing our previous $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a new $3.0 billion unsecured credit facility and the repayment of certain mortgage debt. the loss on extinguishment of debt, net in 2012 resulted primarily from our redemption in march 2012 of all $200.0 million principal amount outstanding of our 61⁄2% senior notes due 2016 and our redemption in may 2012 of all $225.0 million principal amount then outstanding of our 63⁄4% senior notes due 2017, partially offset by gains recognized on the repayment of certain mortgage debt.
merger-related expenses and deal costs merger-related expenses and deal costs in both years consist of transition and integration expenses related to consummated transactions and deal costs required by gaap to be expensed rather than capitalized into the asset value. the $41.5 million decrease in merger-related expenses and deal costs in 2013 over the prior year reflects lower transition and integration costs attributable to a decline in investment activity in 2013 compared to 2012.
other other consists primarily of building rent expense paid to lease certain of our senior living operating communities. certain of these leasing arrangements were acquired in late december 2012.
loss/income from unconsolidated entities loss/income from unconsolidated entities in 2013 and 2012 relates to our interests in joint ventures that we account for under the equity method of accounting. income from unconsolidated entities for the year ended december 31, 2012 is attributed primarily to a gain of $16.6 million as a result of the re-measurement of equity interest upon our acquisition of the controlling interests (ranging from 80% to 95%) in 36 mobs that we previously accounted for as investments in unconsolidated entities. since the acquisition date, operations relating to these properties have been consolidated in our consolidated statements of income. as of december 31, 2013, we had ownership interests ranging between 5% and 25% in joint ventures with respect to 18 mobs, 20 seniors housing communities and 14 skilled nursing facilities, and we had a 34% ownership interest in atria, which we acquired in late december 2012.
income tax benefit income tax benefit for 2013 was due primarily to the release of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets of one of our trs entities. income tax benefit for 2012 was due primarily to the income tax benefit of ordinary losses related to our trs entities, partially offset by a valuation allowance recorded against certain deferred tax assets of one of our other trs entities.
discontinued operations discontinued operations for 2013 reflects activity related to 39 properties, 22 of which were sold during 2013, resulting in a net gain of $3.6 million. discontinued operations for 2012 reflects activity related to 82 properties, 43 of which were sold during 2012, resulting in a net gain of $81.0 million.
net income/loss attributable to noncontrolling interest net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for 2013 represents our partners' joint venture interests in 58 properties. net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest for 2012 represents our partners' joint venture interests in 57 properties.
non-gaap financial measures we believe that net income, as defined by gaap, is the most appropriate earnings measurement. however, we consider certain non-gaap financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. a non-gaap financial measure is a measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not so excluded from or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap. described below are the non-gaap financial measures used by management to evaluate our operating performance and that we consider most useful to investors, together with reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures.
the non-gaap financial measures we present in this annual report on form 10-k may not be comparable to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. you should not consider these measures as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with gaap) as indicators of our financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with gaap) as measures of our liquidity, nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, you should examine these measures in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
funds from operations and normalized funds from operations historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. however, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. for that reason, we consider funds from operations ("ffo") and normalized ffo to be appropriate measures of operating performance of an equity reit. in particular, we believe that normalized ffo is useful because it allows investors, analysts and our management to compare our operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated items and other events such as transactions and litigation. in some cases, we provide information about identified non-cash components of ffo and normalized ffo because it allows investors, analysts and our management to assess the impact of those items on our financial results.
we use the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") definition of ffo. nareit defines ffo as net income (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, including gain on re-measurement of equity method investments, and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis. we define normalized ffo as ffo excluding the following income and expense items (which may be recurring in nature): (a) merger-related costs and expenses, including amortization of intangibles, transition and integration expenses, and deal costs and expenses, including expenses and recoveries relating to our acquisition lawsuits; (b) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of our debt; (c) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses and derivative transactions that have non-cash mark-to-market impacts on our consolidated statements of income; (d) the impact of future acquisitions, divestitures (including pursuant to tenant options to purchase) and
capital transactions; (e) the financial impact of contingent consideration, severance-related costs, charitable donations made to the ventas charitable foundation, gains and losses for non-operational foreign currency hedge agreements and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; and (f) expenses related to the re-audit and re-review in 2014 of our historical financial statements and related matters.
the following table summarizes our ffo and normalized ffo for each of the five years ended december 31, 2014. our normalized ffo for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased over the prior year due primarily to our 2014 and 2013 investments, net of capital costs, and same-store growth across our portfolio of properties, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses and loan repayments since january 1, 2013.

adjusted ebitda we consider adjusted ebitda an important supplemental measure to net income because it provides another manner in which to evaluate our operating performance and serves as another indicator of our ability to service debt. we define adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (including non-cash stock-based compensation expense), excluding gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, merger-related expenses and deal costs, expenses related to the re-audit and re-review of our historical financial statements, net gains on real estate activity and changes in the fair value of financial instruments (including amounts in discontinued operations). the following table sets forth a reconciliation of our adjusted ebitda to net income (including amounts in discontinued operations) for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012:

noi we also consider noi an important supplemental measure to net income because it enables investors, analysts and our management to assess our unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results with the operating results of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis. we define noi as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and medical office building services costs (including amounts in discontinued operations). cash receipts may differ due to straight-line recognition of certain rental income and the application of other gaap policies. the following table sets forth a reconciliation of our noi to net income (including amounts in discontinued operations) for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012:

asset/liability management asset/liability management, a key element of enterprise risk management, is designed to support the achievement of our business strategy, while ensuring that we maintain appropriate and tolerable levels of market risk (primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk) and credit risk. effective management of these risks is a contributing factor to the absolute levels and variability of our ffo and net worth. the following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities, including the use of derivative financial instruments.
market risk market risk related to changes in interest rates, such as libor or prime rates, has a direct impact on borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our unsecured term loans, certain of our mortgage loans that are floating rate obligations, mortgage loans receivable that bear interest at floating rates and marketable debt securities. to mitigate these risks, we continuously monitor our level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors, including our expectations regarding current and future economic conditions.
the table below sets forth certain information with respect to our debt, excluding premiums, discounts and capital lease obligations.
as of december 31,
percent of total debt:
weighted average interest rate at end of period:
(1)   excludes mortgage debt of $43.5 million, $13.1 million and $23.2 million related to real estate assets classified as held for sale as of december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which debt is included in accounts payable and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
the variable rate debt in the table above reflects, in part, the effect of $153.6 million notional amount of interest rate swaps with a maturity of march 21, 2016 that effectively convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. in addition, the fixed rate debt in the table above reflects, in part, the effect of $59.0 million notional amount of interest rate swaps with maturities ranging from march 2, 2015 to april 1, 2019, in each case that effectively convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. the increase in our outstanding variable rate debt at december 31, 2014 compared to december 31, 2013 is attributable primarily to 2014 borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility. pursuant to the terms of certain leases with one of our tenants, if interest rates increase on certain variable rate debt that we have totaling $80.0 million as of december 31, 2014, our tenant is required to pay us additional rent (on a dollar-for-dollar basis) in an amount equal to the increase in interest expense resulting from the increased interest rates. therefore, the increase in interest expense related to this debt is equally offset by an increase in additional rent due to us from the tenant. assuming no change in our variable rate debt outstanding as of december 31, 2014, if the weighted average interest rate related to our variable rate debt were to increase 100 basis points, interest expense for 2015 would increase by approximately $23.8 million, or $0.08 per diluted common share.
as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, our joint venture and operating partners' aggregate share of total debt was $141.4 million and $174.5 million, respectively, with respect to certain properties we owned through consolidated joint ventures and an operating partnership. total debt does not include our portion of debt related to investments in unconsolidated entities, which was $97.5 million and $89.3 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt is based on current interest rates at which we could obtain similar borrowings. for fixed rate debt, interest rate fluctuations generally affect fair value, but not our earnings or cash flows. therefore, interest rate risk does not significantly impact our fixed rate debt obligations until their maturity or earlier prepayment and refinancing. if interest rates have risen at the time we seek to refinance our fixed rate debt, whether at maturity or otherwise, our future earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by increased borrowing costs. conversely, lower interest rates at the time of refinancing may reduce our overall borrowing costs.
to highlight the sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points ("bps") in interest rates as of december 31, 2014 and 2013:
as of december 31,
fair value reflecting change in interest rates (1):
(1)   the change in fair value of our fixed rate debt from december 31, 2013 to december 31, 2014 was due primarily to 2014 senior note issuances, partially offset by mortgage loan repayments.
as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the fair value of our secured and unsecured loans receivable, based on our estimates of currently prevailing rates for comparable loans, was $798.0 million and $395.7 million, respectively. see "note 6-loans receivable and investments" and "note 11-fair values of financial instruments" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
as a result of our canadian and united kingdom operations, we are subject to fluctuations in certain foreign currency exchange rates that may, from time to time, affect our financial condition and operating performance. based solely on our results for the year ended december 31, 2014 (on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the holiday canada acquisition, our 2014 canadian senior note issuances, our u.k. hospital acquisition, and including the impact of existing hedging arrangements ), if the value of the u.s. dollar relative to the british pound and canadian dollar were to increase or decrease by 10% compared to the average exchange rate during that year, our 2014 normalized ffo per share would have decreased or increased, as applicable, by less than $0.02 and $0.02 per share, respectively. we will continue to mitigate these risks through a layered approach to hedging looking out for the next year and continual assessment of our foreign operational capital structure. nevertheless, we cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have an effect on our earnings.
concentration and credit risk we use concentration ratios to identify, understand and evaluate the potential impact of economic downturns and other adverse events that may affect our asset types, geographic locations, business models, and tenants, operators and managers. we evaluate concentration risk in terms of investment mix and operations mix. investment mix measures the percentage of our investments that is concentrated in a specific asset type or that is operated or managed by a particular tenant, operator or manager. operations mix measures the percentage of our operating results that is attributed to a particular tenant, operator or manager, geographic location or business model. the following tables reflect our concentration risk as of the dates and for the periods presented:
as ofdecember 31,
(1)   ratios are based on the gross book value of real estate investments (excluding assets classified as held for sale) as of each reporting date.
operations mix by tenant and operator and business model:
(1)   total revenues include medical office building and other services revenue, revenue from loans and investments and interest and other income (excluding amounts in discontinued operations).
(2)   excludes one seniors housing community included in senior living operations.
see "non-gaap financial measures" included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional disclosure and reconciliations of adjusted ebitda and noi to our net income as computed in accordance with gaap.
we derive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing assets under long-term triple-net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators, subject to certain limitations. some of our triple-net lease escalators are contingent upon the satisfaction of specified facility revenue parameters or based on increases in the consumer price index ("cpi"), with caps, floors or collars. we also earn revenues directly from individual residents in our seniors housing communities that are managed by independent operators, such as atria and sunrise, and tenants in our mobs. for the year ended december 31, 2014, 44.0% of our adjusted ebitda (including amounts in discontinued operations) was derived from our senior living operations and mob operations, for which rental rates may fluctuate more frequently upon lease rollovers and renewals due to shorter term leases and changing economic or market conditions.
the concentration of our triple-net leased properties segment revenues and operating income that are attributed to brookdale senior living and kindred creates credit risk. if either brookdale senior living or kindred becomes unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations to us, our financial condition and results of operations could be weakened and our ability to service our indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders could be limited. we cannot assure you that brookdale senior living and kindred will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to satisfy their respective
obligations to us, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by brookdale senior living or kindred to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, any failure, inability or unwillingness by brookdale senior living or kindred to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect its business reputation and its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which could have an indirect material adverse effect on us. see "risk factors-risks arising from our business-our leases with brookdale senior living and kindred account for a significant portion of our triple-net leased properties segment revenues and operating income; any failure, inability or unwillingness by brookdale senior living or kindred to satisfy its obligations under our agreements could have a material adverse effect on us" included in part i, item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k and "note 3-concentration of credit risk" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
we regularly monitor and assess any changes in the relative credit risk of our significant tenants, and in particular those tenants that have recourse obligations under our triple-net leases. the ratios and metrics we use to evaluate a significant tenant's liquidity and creditworthiness depend on facts and circumstances specific to that tenant and the industry or industries in which it operates, including without limitation the tenant's credit history and economic conditions related to the tenant, its operations and the markets in which the tenant operates, that may vary over time. among other things, we may (i) review and analyze information regarding the real estate, seniors housing and healthcare industries generally, publicly available information regarding the significant tenant, and information required to be provided by the tenant under the terms of its lease agreements with us, (ii) examine monthly and/or quarterly financial statements of the significant tenant to the extent publicly available or otherwise provided under the terms of our lease agreements, and (iii) participate in periodic discussions and in-person meetings with representatives of the significant tenant.  using this information, we calculate multiple financial ratios (which may, but do not necessarily, include net debt to ebitdar or ebitdarm, fixed charge coverage and tangible net worth), after making certain adjustments based on our judgment, and assess other metrics we deem relevant to an understanding of the significant tenant's credit risk.
because atria and sunrise manage our properties in exchange for the receipt of a management fee from us, we are not directly exposed to the credit risk of our managers in the same manner or to the same extent as our triple-net tenants. however, we rely on our managers' personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our senior living operations efficiently and effectively. we also rely on our managers to set appropriate resident fees and to otherwise operate our seniors housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements, including various rights to terminate and exercise remedies under the agreements as provided therein, atria's or sunrise's failure, inability or unwillingness to satisfy its respective obligations under those agreements, to efficiently and effectively manage our properties or to provide timely and accurate accounting information with respect thereto could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, significant changes in atria's or sunrise's senior management or equity ownership or any adverse developments in their businesses and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us. see "risk factors-risks arising from our business-the properties managed by atria and sunrise account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; adverse developments in atria's or sunrise's business and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us" and "-we have rights to terminate our management agreements with atria and sunrise in whole or with respect to specific properties under certain circumstances, and we may be unable to replace atria or sunrise if our management agreements are terminated or not renewed" included in part i, item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k.
in december 2012, we acquired a 34% ownership interest in atria, which entitles us to certain rights and minority protections as well as the right to appoint two of five members on the atria board of directors.
triple-net lease expirations as our triple-net leases expire, we face the risk that our tenants may elect not to renew those leases and, in the event of non-renewal, we may be unable to reposition the applicable properties on a timely basis or on the same or better economic terms, if at all. although the non-renewal of some or all of our triple-net leases could have a material adverse effect on us, during the year ended december 31, 2014, none of our triple-net lease renewals or expirations without renewal had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations for that period. see "risk factors-risks arising from our business-if we must replace any of our tenants or operators, we might be unable to reposition the properties on as favorable terms, or at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on us" included in part i, item ia of this annual report on form 10-k.
the following table summarizes our triple-net lease expirations currently scheduled to occur over the next ten years (excluding leases related to assets classified as held for sale as of december 31, 2014):

as of december 31, 2014, we had re-leased to kindred, transitioned to new operators or sold 107 of the 108 licensed healthcare assets whose lease terms with kindred were scheduled to expire on september 30, 2014, and we expect to sell the remaining asset during 2015; however, this transaction remains subject to customary due diligence conditions, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the sale on a timely basis or at all.
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2014, we had a total of $55.3 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, operating cash and cash related to our senior living operations and mob operations reportable business segments that is deposited and held in property-level accounts. funds maintained in the property-level accounts are used primarily for the payment of property-level expenses, debt service payments and certain capital expenditures. as of december 31, 2014, we also had escrow deposits and restricted cash of $71.8 million and $1.1 billion of unused borrowing capacity available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
during 2014, our principal sources of liquidity were cash flows from operations, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and cad unsecured term loan, proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities, proceeds from asset sales and cash on hand.
for the next 12 months, our principal liquidity needs are to: (i) fund operating expenses; (ii) meet our debt service requirements; (iii) repay maturing mortgage and other debt, including $634.4 million of senior notes; (iv) fund capital expenditures; (v) fund acquisitions, investments and commitments, including development and redevelopment activities; and (vi) make distributions to our stockholders and unitholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a reit. in addition, we may elect to prepay outstanding indebtedness prior to maturity based on our analysis of various factors. we expect that these liquidity needs generally will be satisfied by a combination of the following: cash flows from operations, cash on hand, debt assumptions and financings (including secured financings), issuances of debt and equity securities, dispositions of assets (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility. however, an inability to access liquidity through multiple capital sources concurrently could have a material adverse effect on us. see "risk factors-risks arising from our capital structure-limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy" included in part i, item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k.
in january 2015, we funded the hct acquisition through the issuance of approximately 28.4 million shares of our common stock and 1.1 million limited partnership units that are redeemable for shares of our common stock, the payment of approximately $11 million in cash (excluding cash in lieu of fractional shares) and the assumption or repayment of debt, net of hct cash in hand.
unsecured credit facility and unsecured term loans our unsecured credit facility is comprised of a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility priced at libor plus 1.0% as of december 31, 2014, and a $200.0 million four-year term loan and an $800.0 million five-year term loan, each priced at libor plus 1.05% as of december 31, 2014. the revolving credit facility matures in january 2018, but may be extended, at our option subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, for an additional period of one year. the $200.0 million and $800.0 million term loans mature in january 2018 and january 2019, respectively. the unsecured credit facility also includes an accordion feature that permits us to increase our aggregate borrowing capacity thereunder to up to $3.5 billion.
as of december 31, 2014, we had $919.1 million of borrowings outstanding, $13.3 million of letters of credit outstanding and $1.1 billion of unused borrowing capacity available under our unsecured revolving credit facility.
in july 2014, we entered into a new cad 791.0 million unsecured term loan to initially fund the holiday canada acquisition. the term loan was scheduled to mature on july 30, 2015, but in september 2014, we repaid cad 660.0 million of borrowings principally with proceeds from the sale of unsecured senior notes issued by our wholly owned subsidiary, ventas canada finance limited, and in december 2014, we repaid in full all remaining amounts outstanding under the term loan.
the agreement governing our unsecured credit facility requires us to comply with various financial and other restrictive covenants. see "note 10-borrowing arrangements" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. we were in compliance with all of these covenants at december 31, 2014.

during 2012, we repaid in full, at par, $155.4 million aggregate principal amount then outstanding of our 9% senior notes due 2012 and our 8.25% senior notes due 2012 upon maturity, and we redeemed: all $225.0 million principal amount then outstanding of our 63⁄4% senior notes due 2017 at a redemption price equal to 103.375% of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date; and all $200.0 million principal amount then outstanding of our 61⁄2% senior notes due 2016 at a redemption price equal to 103.25% of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, in each case pursuant to the terms of the applicable indenture governing the notes. as a result of these redemptions, we recognized a total loss on extinguishment of debt of $39.7 million.
we may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding senior notes for cash or in exchange for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, prospects for future access to capital and other factors. the amounts involved may be material.
the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes require us to comply with various financial and other restrictive covenants. see "note 10-borrowing arrangements" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. we were in compliance with all of these covenants at december 31, 2014.
mortgage loan obligations as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, our consolidated aggregate principal amount of mortgage debt outstanding was $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, of which our share was $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively.
during 2014, we assumed or originated mortgage debt of $246.8 million and repaid in full mortgage loans outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $398.0 million. we recognized a net loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.3 million in connection with these repayments.
during 2013, we assumed or originated mortgage debt of $178.8 million in connection with our $1.8 billion of gross investments, and we repaid in full mortgage loans outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $493.7 million. we recognized a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $0.5 million in connection with these repayments.

see "note 4-acquisitions of real estate property" and "note 10-borrowing arrangements" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
dividends in order to continue to qualify as a reit, we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of our reit taxable income (excluding net capital gain). in 2014, our board of directors declared and we paid cash dividends on our common stock aggregating $2.965 per share, which exceeds 100% of our 2014 estimated taxable income after the use of any net operating loss carryforwards. we intend to pay dividends greater than 100% of our taxable income, after the use of any net operating loss carryforwards, for 2015. in connection with the hct acquisition, on january 5, 2015, our board of directors declared a prorated first quarter dividend on our common stock in the amount of $0.2107 per share, which was paid in cash on january 27, 2015 to stockholders of record on january 15, 2015. on february 13, 2015, our board of directors declared another prorated dividend on our common stock in the amount of $0.5793 per share, payable in cash on march 31, 2015 to stockholders of record on march 6, 2015. together, these two prorated amounts equate to the first quarterly installment of our 2015 dividend of $0.79 per share.
we expect that our cash flows will exceed our reit taxable income due to depreciation and other non-cash deductions in computing reit taxable income and that we will be able to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. however, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash on hand or other liquid assets to meet this requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. if we do not have sufficient cash on hand or other liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, or if we desire to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements or any combination of the
foregoing. see "certain u.s. federal income tax considerations-requirements for qualification as a reit-annual distribution requirements" included in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k.
capital expenditures the terms of our triple-net leases generally obligate our tenants to pay all capital expenditures necessary to maintain and improve our triple-net leased properties. however, from time to time, we may fund the capital expenditures for our triple-net leased properties through loans to the tenants or advances, which may increase the amount of rent payable with respect to the properties in certain cases. we expect to fund any capital expenditures for which we may become responsible upon expiration of our triple-net leases or in the event that our tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under those leases with cash flows from operations or through additional borrowings.
we also expect to fund capital expenditures related to our senior living operations and mob operations reportable business segments with the cash flows from the properties or through additional borrowings. to the extent that unanticipated capital expenditure needs arise or significant borrowings are required, our liquidity may be affected adversely. our ability to borrow additional funds may be restricted in certain circumstances by the terms of the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness.
we are party to certain agreements that obligate us to develop seniors housing or healthcare properties funded through capital that we and, in certain circumstances, our joint venture partners provide. as of december 31, 2014, we had one new property under development pursuant to these agreements. through december 31, 2014, we have funded $3.4 million of our estimated total commitment over the projected development period ($10.0 million to $11.0 million) toward these projects. in addition, from time to time, we engage in redevelopment projects with respect to our existing seniors housing communities to maximize the value, increase noi, maintain a market-competitive position, achieve property stabilization or change the primary use of the property.
equity offerings and related events in march 2013, we established an "at-the-market" ("atm") equity offering program through which we may sell from time to time up to an aggregate of $750 million of our common stock. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we issued and sold a total of 3,381,678 shares of common stock under the program for aggregate net proceeds of $242.3 million (all of which was received in the fourth quarter of 2014), after sales agent commissions of $3.7 million. as of december 31, 2014, approximately $360.4 million of our common stock remained available for sale under our atm equity offering program. in january 2015, we issued and sold a total of 3,750,202 shares of common stock under the atm program for aggregate net proceeds of $285.8 million, after sales agent commissions of $4.4 million.

in december 2012, through our acquisition of certain private equity funds, we acquired 3.7 million shares of our common stock that were held in treasury and subsequently canceled in february 2014. see "note 4-acquisitions of real estate property."
in june 2012, we completed the public offering and sale of 5,980,000 shares of our common stock for $342.5 million in aggregate proceeds.
in april 2012, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on form s-3 relating to the sale, from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of debt securities and related guarantees, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. this registration statement replaced our previous automatic shelf registration statement, which expired pursuant to the sec's rules.
other we received proceeds of $26.2 million and $6.1 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, from the exercises of outstanding stock options. future proceeds from the exercises of stock options will be affected primarily by the future trading price of our common stock and the number of options outstanding. the number of options outstanding increased to 2,460,628 as of december 31, 2014, from 2,258,763 as of december 31, 2013. the weighted average exercise price was $57.45 as of december 31, 2014.
we issued approximately 19,000 and 29,000 shares of common stock under our distribution reinvestment and stock purchase plan ("drip") for net proceeds of $1.2 million and $1.9 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the drip was suspended effective july 3, 2014. we may determine whether or not to reinstate the drip at any time, in our sole discretion.

cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities increased in 2014 over the prior year primarily due to our 2013 and 2014 investments, net of capital costs, and same-store growth across our portfolio of properties, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses and merger-related expenses and deal costs, and expenses related to the re-audit and re-review in 2014 of our historical financial statements and related matters.
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities during 2014 and 2013 consisted primarily of cash paid for our investments in real estate ($1.5 billion and $1.4 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively), investments in loans receivable ($499.0 million and $38.0 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively), purchase of marketable securities ($96.7 million in 2014), capital expenditures ($87.5 million and $81.6 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively) and development project expenditures ($107.0 million and $95.7 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively). these uses were partially offset by proceeds from loans receivable ($73.6 million and $325.5 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively), proceeds from the sale or maturity of marketable debt securities ($21.7 million and $5.5 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively), and proceeds from real estate dispositions ($118.2 million and $35.6 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively).

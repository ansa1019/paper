item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate developments introduction wisconsin energy corporation is a diversified holding company with subsidiaries primarily in a utility energy segment and a non-utility energy segment. unless qualified by their context, when used in this document the terms wisconsin energy, the company, our, us or we refer to the holding company and all of its subsidiaries.
our utility energy segment primarily consists of wisconsin electric and wisconsin gas, both doing business under the trade name of "we energies." we generate and distribute electricity in wisconsin and the upper peninsula of michigan and we distribute natural gas in wisconsin. our non-utility energy segment primarily consists of we power, which primarily owns and leases to wisconsin electric electric power generating facilities constructed as part of our ptf strategy.
corporate strategy business opportunities acquisition:   on june 22, 2014, we entered into an agreement to acquire integrys. the proposed acquisition is scheduled to close in the second half of 2015, and is subject to the receipt of various approvals. this acquisition is in alignment with our corporate strategy to invest in regulated electric and gas businesses. we expect the acquisition to:
•   add approximately $6.6 billion of regulated fixed assets;
•   add 0.5 million electric customers;
•   add 1.7 million gas customers; and
•   increase our ownership of atc to 60% from 26.2%.
for additional information on this acquisition, see note d -- proposed acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
additional investment opportunities:   our primary investment opportunities are in three areas: our regulated utility business; our investment in atc; and our generation plants within our non-utility energy segment.
our regulated utility business primarily consists of electric generation assets and the electric and gas distribution assets that serve our electric and gas customers under the trade name of we energies. we energies operates under a traditional rate regulated cost of service environment. during 2014, our regulated utility earned $770.2 million of operating income. over the next five years, we currently expect to invest between $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion in this business.
we have a 26.2% ownership interest in atc, a miso member company regulated by ferc. our investment in atc totaled $424.1 million as of december 31, 2014, and our 2014 pre-tax earnings from atc totaled $66.0 million. over the next five years, in addition to any potential investment through our undistributed earnings in atc, on a stand-alone basis we expect to make capital contributions of approximately $130 million in atc as it continues to invest in transmission projects.
our non-utility energy segment consists primarily of the four generation plants constructed as part of our ptf strategy. all four plants have been placed in service and are being leased to wisconsin electric under long-term leases that run for 25 years (pwgs 1 and pwgs 2) and 30 years (oc 1 and oc 2). we recognize revenues on a levelized basis over the life of the leases. our operating income from our non-utility business totaled $368.2 million during 2014. over the next five years, we expect to invest approximately $130 million in this segment. these investments should provide additional earnings.

(a)   represents distribution sales for customers who have purchased power from an alternative electric supplier in michigan.
2014 vs. 2013:   our electric utility operating revenues increased by $92.4 million, or 2.8%, when compared to 2013. the most significant factors that caused a change in revenues were:
•   a $120.9 million increase in sales for resale because of increased sales into the miso energy markets as a result of michigan's alternative electric supplier program and increased availability of our generating units. the margin on these sales is used to reduce fuel costs for our retail customers.
•   a $78.4 million decrease in large commercial/industrial sales because of the two iron ore mines switching to an alternative electric supplier in september 2013. see factors affecting results, liquidity and capital resources -- industry restructuring and competition -- michigan business, for a discussion of the impact of industry restructuring in michigan on our electric sales.
•   a $59.4 million increase in other operating revenues, primarily driven by the recognition of $56.4 million related to revenues under the system support resource (ssr) agreement with miso. see factors affecting results, liquidity and capital resources -- industry restructuring and competition -- michigan business -- ssr payments for further discussion.
•   wisconsin net retail pricing increases of $38.3 million, which are primarily related to our 2013 wisconsin rate case.
as measured by cooling degree days, 2014 was 36.6% cooler than normal, and 32.6% cooler than 2013 due to mild second and third quarters. the unfavorable impact of the cool summer weather was partially offset by the cold winter weather. residential sales decreased by 2.4%, primarily due to the weather. sales to our large commercial/industrial customers decreased by 14.8% primarily because of the loss of the two iron ore mines in michigan. if the mines are excluded, sales to our large commercial/industrial customers decreased 1.1%. the two iron ore mines, which we served on an interruptible tariff rate, switched to an alternative electric supplier effective september 1, 2013. in addition, other smaller retail customers switched to an alternative electric supplier.
effective february 1, 2015, the two mines returned as retail customers. we expect to defer the net revenue from those sales and apply these amounts for the benefit of wisconsin retail electric customers in future rate proceedings. michigan state law allows the mines to switch to an alternative electric supplier after sufficient notice.
2013 vs. 2012:   our electric utility operating revenues increased by $114.8 million, or 3.6%, when compared to 2012. the most significant factors that caused a change in revenues were:
•   wisconsin net retail pricing increases of $115.6 million ($177.7 million less $62.1 million related to section 1603 renewable energy treasury grant (treasury grant) bill credits), which are primarily related to our 2013 wisconsin rate case. for information on the treasury grant and the rate order in the 2013 rate case, see factors affecting results, liquidity and capital resources -- accounting developments and -- utility rates and regulatory matters, respectively.
•   an $89.8 million increase in sales for resale due to increased sales into the miso energy markets as a result of increased availability of our generating units.
•   a $23.1 million decrease in other operating revenues, primarily driven by the amortization of $25.9 million in 2012 related to proceeds we received as part of a settlement with the united states department of energy (doe) regarding the doe's failure to remove spent nuclear fuel from point beach.
as measured by cooling degree days, 2013 was 5.8% cooler than normal, and 33.9% cooler than 2012. residential sales decreased by 2.1%, primarily due to the weather. sales to our large commercial/industrial customers decreased by 10.7% primarily because of the loss of the two iron ore mines in michigan. if the mines are excluded, sales to our large commercial/industrial customers decreased 3.0%. wholesale - other sales increased 24.7% primarily due to increased off-peak energy sales which generate lower incremental revenue because the majority of our wholesale revenue is tied to demand.
2013 vs. 2012:   our electric fuel and purchased power costs increased by $54.2 million, or approximately 5.0%, when compared to 2012. this increase was primarily caused by a 6.3% increase in total mwh sales, partially offset by a decrease in our average cost of fuel because of outage timing and a decrease in coal costs.
44      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k gas utility revenues, gross margin and therm deliveries the following table compares our total gas utility operating revenues and gross margin (total gas utility operating revenues less cost of gas sold) during 2014, 2013 and 2012.
(millions of dollars)
operating revenues              $1,496.1              $1,113.7              $962.6
cost of gas sold                 1,036.1                 674.1               545.8
we believe gross margin is a better performance indicator than revenues because changes in the cost of gas sold flow through to revenue under gcrms. our average cost of gas per therm during 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $0.70, $0.48 and $0.50, respectively. the following table compares our gas utility gross margin and therm deliveries by customer class during 2014, 2013 and 2012:
(millions of dollars)                                                  (millions)
customer class residential                        $291.8              $284.2              $267.9              911.5               872.0               676.4
other operating                       6.6                 5.4                 5.5                  -                   -                   -
2014 vs. 2013:   our total retail gas margin increased by $15.8 million, or approximately 4.1%, when compared to 2013, primarily because of colder winter weather in 2014. we estimate that colder winter weather increased gas margins by approximately $11.2 million. as measured by heating degree days, 2014 was 5.3% colder than 2013 and 15.4% colder than normal.
2013 vs. 2012:   our total retail gas margin increased by $24.1 million, or approximately 6.7%, when compared to 2012. we estimate that colder winter weather increased gas margins by approximately $56.9 million. as measured by heating degree days, 2013 was 26.8% colder than 2012 and 9.9% colder than normal. gas margins were reduced by $42.3 million because of lower gas rates that became effective january 1, 2013.
other operation and maintenance expense
2014 vs. 2013:   our other operation and maintenance expense decreased by $59.3 million, or approximately 3.9%, when compared to 2013. this decrease was primarily driven by lower benefit costs related to pensions and medical costs.
our utility operation and maintenance expenses are influenced by, among other things, labor costs, employee benefit costs, plant outages and amortization of regulatory assets.
2013 vs. 2012:   our other operation and maintenance expense increased by $45.5 million, or approximately 3.1%, when compared to 2012. this increase was primarily driven by the reinstatement of $148.0 million of regulatory amortizations, offset in part by a $50.1 million reduction in bad debt expense related to our natural gas customers and continued cost control efforts across our utilities. for additional information on the regulatory amortizations, see factors affecting results, liquidity and capital resources -- utility rates and regulatory matters -- 2012 wisconsin rate case.
2014 vs. 2013:   depreciation and amortization expense increased by $20.4 million, or approximately 6.4%, when compared to 2013. this increase was primarily because of an overall increase in utility plant in service as a result of the biomass plant that went into service in november 2013. for additional information on the biomass facility, see factors affecting results, liquidity and capital resources -- utility rates and regulatory matters -- renewables, efficiency, and conservation.
2013 vs. 2012:   depreciation and amortization expense increased by $23.8 million, or approximately 8.0%, when compared to 2012. this increase was primarily because of an overall increase in utility plant in service. in addition to the biomass facility that went into service in november 2013, the emission control equipment for units 5 and 6 of the oak creek air quality control system (aqcs) project went into service in march 2012, and for units 7 and 8 in september 2012.
treasury grant during 2014, we recognized $17.4 million of income related to a treasury grant associated with the completion of the biomass plant, compared to $48.0 million in 2013. the lower grant income corresponds to the lower bill credits provided to our retail electric customers in wisconsin in 2014. for additional information on the treasury grant, see factors affecting results, liquidity and capital resources -- accounting developments.
non-utility energy segment contribution to operating income our non-utility energy segment consists primarily of our ptf units (pwgs 1, pwgs 2, oc 1 and oc 2).
this segment reflects the lease revenues on the ptf units as well as the depreciation expense. operating and maintenance costs and limited management fees associated with the plants are the responsibility of wisconsin electric and are recorded in the utility segment.
(millions of dollars)
operating revenues                     $447.1              $446.7              $439.9
operation and maintenance expense        11.4                12.5                14.0

2014 vs. 2013:   non-utility energy segment operating income increased $1.1 million, or approximately 0.3%, when compared to 2013.
2013 vs. 2012:   non-utility energy segment operating income increased $8.3 million, or approximately 2.3%, when compared to 2012. the increase primarily relates to the increase in operating revenues related to the final approved construction costs for the oak creek expansion as part of the 2013 wisconsin rate case.
46      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k corporate and other contribution to operating income
2014 vs. 2013:   corporate and other affiliates had an operating loss of $26.3 million in 2014 compared with an operating loss of $6.4 million in 2013. the increase in operating loss is primarily attributable to approximately $14.6 million, or $0.06 per share, of external costs related to the proposed acquisition of integrys.
2013 vs. 2012:   corporate and other affiliates had an operating loss of $6.4 million in 2013 compared with an operating loss of $6.2 million in 2012.
(millions of dollars)
2014 vs. 2013:   other income and deductions, net decreased by approximately $5.4 million, or 28.7%, when compared to 2013. this decrease primarily relates to lower afudc - equity related to the biomass plant going into service in november 2013, partially offset by an increased gain on property sales.
2013 vs. 2012:   other income and deductions, net decreased by approximately $16.0 million, or 46.0%, when compared to 2012. this decrease primarily relates to lower afudc - equity related to the oak creek aqcs project which emission control equipment went into service in march 2012 for units 5 and 6 and september 2012 for units 7 and 8, partially offset by the biomass plant which went into service in november 2013.

less: capitalized interest             3.0                 9.4                15.9
2014 vs. 2013:   our net interest expense decreased by $10.6 million, or 4.2%, as compared to 2013 primarily because of lower debt levels and lower average interest rates on long-term debt. our capitalized interest decreased by $6.4 million primarily because of lower construction work in progress as the biomass plant went into service in november 2013.
2013 vs. 2012:   our net interest expense increased by $3.9 million, or 1.6%, as compared to 2012 primarily because of lower capitalized interest. our capitalized interest decreased by $6.5 million primarily because of lower construction work in progress.
2014 vs. 2013:   our effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was 38.1% in 2014 compared to 36.9% in 2013. this increase in our effective tax rate was due to reduced tax benefits associated with treasury grant income, decreased afudc - equity and non-deductible acquisition related expenses. for further information, see
47      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k note g -- income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements. we expect our 2015 annual effective tax rate to be between 37.0% and 38.0%.
liquidity and capital resources cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows during 2014, 2013 and 2012:
(millions of dollars)
operating activities             $1,197.7              $1,231.0              $1,173.9
operating activities
2014 vs. 2013:   cash provided by operating activities was $1,197.7 million during 2014, which was a decrease of $33.3 million when compared to 2013. during 2014, we experienced higher net income, depreciation expense and favorable cash flows from accounts receivable, primarily because of the timing of the treasury grant. more than offsetting these favorable items were increases in working capital related to natural gas in storage and increases in regulatory assets.
2013 vs. 2012:   cash provided by operating activities was $1,231.0 million during 2013, which was an increase of $57.1 million over 2012. the increase is primarily because of lower contributions to our qualified benefit plans and higher non-cash charges to earnings. during 2013, we made no contributions to our qualified benefit plans, compared to contributions of $100 million during 2012. in addition, we had higher net income, depreciation expense and amortization expense. included in the higher amortization expense is a $77.9 million increase in the amortization of regulatory items. partially offsetting these items is an increase in accounts receivable and accrued revenues of $201.2 million because of colder winter weather and the treasury grant.
2014 vs. 2013:   cash used in investing activities was $756.8 million during 2014, which was $11.0 million higher than 2013. this increase was driven by an increase of $48.7 million in capital expenditures, primarily because of starting the conversion of the fuel source for vapp from coal to natural gas. this increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by an increase in proceeds received from asset sales and a decrease of cost of removal, net of salvage.
the following table identifies capital expenditures by year:
capital expenditures                      2014                2013                2012
(millions of dollars)
total capital expenditures          $736.1              $687.4              $707.0
2013 vs. 2012:   cash used in investing activities was $745.8 million during 2013, which was $16.2 million higher than 2012. our change in restricted cash decreased by $40.1 million, which is related to the 2012 release of restricted cash through bill credits and the reimbursement of costs associated with the proceeds we received from the settlement with the doe. our capital expenditures decreased by $19.6 million during 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily because of decreased spending as the oak creek aqcs project went into service in 2012.
(millions of dollars)
2014 vs. 2013:   cash used in financing activities was $405.0 million during 2014, compared to $494.8 million during 2013. the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by a decrease in common stock repurchased as a result of our board of directors terminating our share repurchase program in connection with the proposed acquisition of integrys. during 2014, we repurchased $18.6 million of common stock as compared to $126.0 million in 2013 as part of the share repurchase program. see note h -- common equity for additional information on share repurchases. our dividends paid on common stock increased by $23.1 million during 2014 as compared to 2013, as a result of increases in the quarterly common stock dividend of 12.5% and 2.0% in the third quarter of 2013 and first quarter of 2014, respectively.
2013 vs. 2012:   cash used in financing activities was $494.8 million during 2013, compared to $422.8 million during 2012. our dividends paid on common stock increased by $52.6 million during 2013 as compared to 2012, as a result of increases in the quarterly common stock dividend of 13.3% and 12.5% in the first and third quarter, respectively. in 2013, we repurchased approximately 3.0 million shares in the open market at a total cost of $126.0 million, compared to 1.5 million shares at a cost of $51.8 million in 2012 pursuant to a share repurchase program that expired at the end of 2013.
no new shares of wisconsin energy's common stock were issued in 2014, 2013 or 2012. during these years, our independent plan agents purchased, in the open market, 2.3 million shares at a cost of $104.6 million, 2.4 million shares at a cost of $97.4 million and 2.8 million shares at a cost of $101.4 million, respectively, to fulfill exercised stock options and restricted stock awards. in 2014, 2013 and 2012, we received proceeds of $50.3 million, $48.5 million and $49.8 million, respectively, related to the exercise of stock options. in addition, we instructed our independent agents to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market to satisfy our obligations under our stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan and various employee benefit plans.
capital resources and requirements working capital as of december 31, 2014, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately $133.3 million. we do not expect this to have any impact on our liquidity because we believe we have adequate back-up lines of credit in place for ongoing operations. we also have access to the capital markets to finance our construction program and to refinance current maturities of long-term debt if necessary.
49      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k liquidity we anticipate meeting our capital requirements for our existing operations through internally generated funds and short-term borrowings, supplemented by the issuance of intermediate or long-term debt securities.
for our existing business, we currently have access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements. our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan. we currently believe that we have adequate capacity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future through our existing borrowing arrangements, access to capital markets and internally generated cash.
wisconsin energy, wisconsin electric and wisconsin gas maintain bank back-up credit facilities, which provide liquidity support for each company's obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.
as of december 31, 2014, we had approximately $1.2 billion of available, undrawn lines under our bank back-up credit facilities. as of december 31, 2014, we had approximately $617.6 million of commercial paper outstanding on a consolidated basis that was supported by the available lines of credit. during 2014, our maximum commercial paper outstanding was $721.4 million with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.18%. for additional information regarding our commercial paper balances during 2014, see note k -- short-term debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
we review our bank back-up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations. the following table summarizes such facilities as of december 31, 2014:
company                  total facility       letters of credit                credit available   facility expiration
(millions of dollars)
in december 2014, we amended each of our credit facilities to extend their expirations from december 2017 to december 2019.
each of these facilities has a renewal provision for two one-year extensions, subject to lender approval.
50      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k the following table shows our capitalization structure as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, as well as an adjusted capitalization structure that we believe is consistent with the manner in which the rating agencies currently view wisconsin energy's 2007 series a junior subordinated notes due 2067 (junior notes):
capitalization structure                                      actual               adjusted                 actual               adjusted

for a summary of the interest rate, maturity and amount outstanding of each series of our long-term debt on a consolidated basis, see the consolidated statements of capitalization.
included in long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 is $500 million aggregate principal amount of the junior notes. the adjusted presentation attributes $250 million of the junior notes to common equity and $250 million to long-term debt. we believe this presentation is consistent with the 50% or greater equity credit the majority of rating agencies currently attribute to the junior notes.
the adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is presented as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with gaap. management evaluates and manages wisconsin energy's capitalization structure, including its total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the gaap calculation as adjusted by the rating agency treatment of the junior notes. therefore, we believe the non-gaap adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure.
as described in note h -- common equity, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, certain restrictions exist on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us. we do not expect these restrictions to have any material effect on our operations or ability to meet our cash obligations.
wisconsin electric is the obligor under two series of tax exempt pollution control refunding bonds in outstanding principal amounts of $147 million. in august 2009, wisconsin electric terminated letters of credit that provided credit and liquidity support for the bonds, which resulted in a mandatory tender of the bonds. wisconsin electric issued commercial paper to fund the purchase of the bonds. as of december 31, 2014, the repurchased bonds were still outstanding, but were not reported as long-term debt or included on our consolidated statements of capitalization because they are held by wisconsin electric. depending on market conditions and other factors, wisconsin electric may change the method used to determine the interest rate on the bonds and have them remarketed to third parties.
bonus depreciation provisions the tax increase prevention act of 2014 was signed into law on december 19, 2014, which extended the 50% bonus depreciation rules to include assets placed in service in 2014. as a result of the increased federal tax depreciation for 2014 and prior years, we did not make federal income tax payments for 2013 and 2014.
credit rating risk we do not have any credit agreements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. we do have certain agreements in the form of commodity contracts and
51      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k employee benefit plans that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below bbb- at standard & poor's ratings services (s&p) and/or baa3 at moody's investor service (moody's). as of december 31, 2014, we estimate that the collateral or the termination payments required under these agreements totaled approximately $198.0 million. generally, collateral may be provided by a wisconsin energy guaranty, letter of credit or cash. we also have other commodity contracts that in the event of a credit rating downgrade could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.
in addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.
in december 2014, moody's affirmed the ratings of wisconsin electric (senior unsecured, a1; commercial paper, p-1) and wisconsin gas (senior unsecured, a1; commercial paper, p-1). moody's affirmed the stable ratings outlook for wisconsin electric and wisconsin gas. in june 2014, moody's affirmed the ratings of wisconsin energy (senior unsecured, a2; junior subordinated, a3; commercial paper, p-1), elm road generating station supercritical, llc (ergss) (senior notes, a1) and wisconsin energy capital corporation (wecc) (senior unsecured, a2). moody's also affirmed the stable ratings outlook for ergss, and revised the ratings outlook for wisconsin energy and wecc from stable to negative.
in august 2014, fitch ratings (fitch) affirmed the ratings of wisconsin electric (commercial paper, f1; senior unsecured, a+), wisconsin gas (commercial paper, f1; senior unsecured, a) and ergss (senior notes, a+). fitch also affirmed the stable ratings outlook for these companies. in june 2014, fitch placed the ratings of wisconsin energy and wecc on rating watch negative.
in june 2014, s&p affirmed the ratings of wisconsin energy (commercial paper, a-2; senior unsecured, bbb+; junior subordinated, bbb), wisconsin electric (commercial paper, a-2; senior unsecured, a-), wisconsin gas (commercial paper, a-1; senior unsecured, a) and wecc (senior unsecured, a-). s&p affirmed the stable ratings outlook for wisconsin electric and wisconsin gas, and revised the ratings outlook from stable to negative for wisconsin energy and wecc.
the change in outlooks for wisconsin energy and wecc relates to the proposed acquisition of integrys.
subject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. however, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. an explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.
capital requirements acquisition of integrys:   on june 22, 2014, we entered into an agreement to acquire integrys. we expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2015. under the terms of the merger agreement, for each share of integrys common stock, integrys shareholders will receive 1.128 shares of wisconsin energy common stock and $18.58 in cash. we expect to finance the acquisition through the issuance of approximately 91 million shares of wisconsin energy common stock to integrys shareholders and through the issuance of $1.5 billion of debt. we will also assume all of integrys' outstanding debt, which had an estimated fair value of $3.3 billion.
capital expenditures:   for our existing business, our estimated capital expenditures for the next three years are as follows:
capital expenditures                2015                2016                2017
(millions of dollars)
52      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k the majority of spending consists of upgrading our electric and gas distribution systems. our actual future long-term capital requirements may vary from these estimates because of changing environmental and other regulations such as air quality standards, renewable energy standards and electric reliability initiatives that impact our utility energy segment.
common stock matters:  in december 2013, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $300 million of our common stock from january 1, 2014 through the end of 2017. through december 31, 2014, we acquired approximately 0.4 million shares in the open market at a cost of $18.6 million pursuant to this program. all of these shares were purchased during the first quarter of 2014. on june 22, 2014, in connection with the proposed acquisition of integrys, the board of directors terminated this share repurchase program.
in addition, on january 15, 2015, our board of directors increased our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.4225 per share, up approximately 8.3%, from $0.39 per share, effective with the first quarter 2015 dividend payment. this equates to an annual dividend of $1.69 per share. the board of directors reaffirmed a policy that targets a dividend payout ratio that trends to 65-70% of earnings in 2017.
upon consummation of the proposed acquisition of integrys, we expect to increase the dividend 7-8% for our shareholders to reflect the dividend policy of the combined company. the projected payout target for the combined company in future years after closing the acquisition is 65-70% of earnings.
investments in outside trusts:   we use outside trusts to fund our pension and certain other post-retirement obligations. these trusts had investments of approximately $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2014. these trusts hold investments that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates.
during 2014 and 2013, we made no contributions to our qualified pension plans or our qualified other post-retirement employee benefit (opeb) plans. in january 2015, we contributed $100 million to our qualified pension plans. future contributions to the plans will be dependent upon many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets and long-term discount rates. for additional information, see note n -- benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
off-balance sheet arrangements:   we are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit which support construction projects, commodity contracts and other payment obligations. we believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our investors. for additional information, see note f -- variable interest entities in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report.
53      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k contractual obligations/commercial commitments:   we have the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december 31, 2014:
(millions of dollars)
capital lease obligations (c)               174.0                    43.5                      59.0                    30.2                      41.3
operating lease obligations (d)              38.1                     5.2                       7.1                     4.3                      21.5
(a)   the amounts included in the table are calculated using current market prices, forward curves and other estimates.
(b)   principal and interest payments on long-term debt (excluding capital lease obligations).
(c)   capital lease obligations of wisconsin electric for power purchase commitments. this amount does not include we power leases to wisconsin electric which are eliminated upon consolidation.
(d)   operating lease obligations for power purchase commitments and rail car leases.
(e)   purchase obligations under various contracts for the procurement of fuel, power, gas supply and associated transportation related to utility operations and for construction, information technology and other services for utility and we power operations. this includes the power purchase agreement for point beach.
the table above does not include liabilities related to the accounting treatment for uncertainty in income taxes because we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the amount and period of related future payments at this time. for additional information regarding these liabilities, refer to note g -- income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report.
obligations for utility operations have historically been included as part of the rate-making process and therefore are generally recoverable from customers.
factors affecting results, liquidity and capital resources market risks and other significant risks we are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environment in which those businesses operate. these risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:
regulatory recovery:   our utility energy segment accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance for regulated entities. our rates are determined by regulatory authorities. our primary regulator is the pscw. regulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if the regulated entity believes the recovery of these costs is probable. we record regulatory assets pursuant to specific orders or by a generic order issued by our regulators, and recovery of these deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval of those regulators. we assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. if the recovery of these costs is not approved by our regulators, the costs are charged to income in the current period. in general, regulatory assets are recovered in a period between one to eight years. regulatory assets associated with pension and opeb expenses are amortized as a component of pension and opeb expense. regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. we record these items as regulatory
54      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k liabilities. as of december 31, 2014, our regulatory assets totaled $1,271.2 million and our regulatory liabilities totaled $830.6 million.
commodity prices:   in the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations of the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. we manage our fuel and gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long-term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas and fuel oil. in addition, we manage the risk of price volatility by utilizing gas and electric hedging programs.
wisconsin's retail electric fuel cost adjustment procedure mitigates some of wisconsin electric's risk of electric fuel cost fluctuation. the fuel rules allow for a deferral of prudently incurred fuel costs that fall outside of a symmetrical band (plus or minus 2%). under the rules, any over or under-collection of fuel costs deferred at the end of the year would be incorporated into fuel cost recovery rates in future years. for information regarding the fuel rules, see utility rates and regulatory matters -- wisconsin fuel proceedings.
natural gas costs:   higher natural gas costs could increase our working capital requirements and result in higher gross receipts taxes in the state of wisconsin. higher natural gas costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. higher natural gas costs may also lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and/or fuel substitution.
as part of its december 2014 rate order, the pscw authorized continued use of the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs. the escrow method of accounting for bad debt costs allows for deferral of wisconsin residential bad debt expense that exceeds or is less than amounts allowed in rates.
as a result of gcrms, our gas utility operations receive dollar for dollar recovery on the cost of natural gas. however, increased natural gas costs increase the risk that customers will switch to alternative fuel sources, which could reduce future gas margins. for information concerning the natural gas utilities' gcrms, see utility rates and regulatory matters.
weather:   our wisconsin utility rates are set by the pscw based upon estimated temperatures which approximate 20-year averages. wisconsin electric's electric revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season, and to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. our gas revenues and sales are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. a summary of actual weather information in the utility segment's service territory during 2014, 2013 and 2012, as measured by degree days, may be found above in results of operations.
interest rate:   we have various short-term borrowing arrangements to provide working capital and general corporate funds. we also have variable rate long-term debt outstanding as of december 31, 2014. borrowing levels under these arrangements vary from period to period depending on capital investments and other factors. future short-term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short-term interest rates and borrowing levels.
we performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december 31, 2014 of our outstanding portfolio of commercial paper and variable rate long-term debt. as of december 31, 2014, we had $617.6 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.22%. a one-percentage point change in interest rates would cause our annual interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately $6.2 million.
marketable securities return:   we use various trusts to fund our pension and opeb obligations. these trusts invest in debt and equity securities. changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and opeb expenses. additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. we believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated through future rate actions by our various utility regulators.
55      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k the fair value of our trust fund assets and expected long-term returns were approximately:
as of december 31, 2014 (millions of dollars)          expected return on assets in 2015
pension trust funds                                                   $1,444.6                                      7.00                  %
other post-retirement benefits trust funds                              $333.5                                      7.25                  %
fiduciary oversight of the pension and opeb trust fund investments is the responsibility of an investment trust policy committee. the committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. the targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long-term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long-term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near-term benefit payments. investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.
we consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long-term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted-average of long-term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the fund.
economic conditions:   our service territory is within the state of wisconsin and the upper peninsula of michigan. we are exposed to market risks in the regional midwest economy. in addition, any economic downturn or disruption of national or international markets could adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and demand for their products, which could affect their demand for our products.
inflation:   we continue to monitor the impact of inflation, especially with respect to the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, and regulatory and environmental compliance in order to minimize its effects in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements and cost reductions. we do not believe the impact of general inflation will have a material impact on our future results of operations.
for additional information concerning risk factors, including market risks, see the cautionary statement regarding forward-looking information at the beginning of this report and risk factors in item 1a.
power the future all of the ptf units have been placed into service and are positioned to provide a significant portion of our future generation needs. the ptf units include pwgs 1, pwgs 2, oc 1 and oc 2.
as part of our 2013 wisconsin rate case, the pscw determined that 100% of the construction costs for our oak creek expansion units were prudently incurred, and approved the recovery in rates of more than 99.5% of these costs.
we are recovering our costs in these units, including subsequent capital additions, through lease payments associated with pwgs 1, pwgs 2, oc 1 and oc 2 that are billed from we power to wisconsin electric and then recovered in wisconsin electric's rates as authorized by the pscw, the mpsc and ferc. under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% return on equity and the equity ratio is assumed to be 53% for the pwgs units and 55% for the oak creek units.
wisconsin electric operates the ptf units and is authorized by the pscw to fully recover prudently incurred operating and maintenance costs in its wisconsin electric rates. as the operator of the units, wisconsin electric may request we power make capital improvements to or further investments in the units. under the lease terms, we would expect the costs of any capital improvements or further investments to be added to the lease payments, and ultimately to be recovered in wisconsin electric's rates.
56      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k we power assigned its warranty rights to wisconsin electric upon turnover of each of the oak creek expansion units. the warranty claim for costs incurred to repair steam turbine corrosion damage identified on both units was scheduled to go to arbitration in october 2013, but we entered into a settlement agreement with bechtel in june 2013 resolving the claim, as well as several other warranty claims. this settlement did not have a material impact to our financial statements. all warranty claims between the company and bechtel have now been resolved, none of which had a material impact on our financial statements.
utility rates and regulatory matters the pscw regulates our retail electric, natural gas and steam rates in the state of wisconsin, while ferc regulates our wholesale power, electric transmission and interstate gas transportation service rates. the mpsc regulates our retail electric rates in the state of michigan. within our regulated segment, for the year ended december 31, 2014, we estimate that approximately 85% of our electric revenues were regulated by the pscw, 2% were regulated by the mpsc and the balance of our electric revenues was regulated by ferc. in wisconsin, a general rate case is typically filed every two years. all of our natural gas and steam revenues are regulated by the pscw. orders from the pscw can be viewed at http://psc.wi.gov/ and orders from the mpsc can be viewed at www.michigan.gov/mpsc/.
2015 wisconsin rate case:   in may 2014, wisconsin electric and wisconsin gas applied to the pscw for a biennial review of costs and rates. on december 23, 2014, the pscw approved the following rate adjustments:
•   a net bill increase related to non-fuel costs for wisconsin electric's wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $2.7 million (0.1%) in 2015. this amount reflects wisconsin electric's receipt of ssr payments from miso that are higher than wisconsin electric anticipated when it filed its rate request in may 2014, as well as an offset of $26.6 million related to a refund of prior fuel costs and the remainder of the proceeds from the treasury grant wisconsin electric received in connection with its biomass facility. this $26.6 million is being returned to customers in the form of bill credits.
•   an electric rate increase for wisconsin electric's wisconsin retail electric customers of $26.6 million (0.9%) for 2016, related to the expiration of the bill credits provided to customers in 2015.
•   a rate decrease of $13.9 million (-0.5%) in 2015 related to a forecasted decrease in fuel costs. wisconsin electric will make an annual fuel cost filing, as required, for 2016.
•   a rate decrease of $10.7 million (-2.4%) for wisconsin electric's natural gas customers in 2015, with no rate adjustment in 2016.
•   rate increases of $17.1 million (2.6%) in 2015 and $21.4 million (3.2%) in 2016 for wisconsin gas' natural gas customers.
•   an increase of approximately $0.5 million (2.0%) for wisconsin electric's downtown milwaukee (valley) steam utility customers for 2015, with no rate adjustment in 2016.
•   an increase of $1.2 million (7.3%) for wisconsin electric's milwaukee county steam utility customers for 2015, with no rate adjustment in 2016.
these rate adjustments were effective january 1, 2015. the electric rates reflect an increased allocation to fixed charges from 7.8% to 13.6% of total electric revenue requirements to more closely reflect our cost structure. in addition, the authorized return on equity for wisconsin electric and wisconsin gas was set at 10.2% and 10.3%, respectively. the pscw also authorized an increase in wisconsin gas' financial common equity component to an average of 49.5% compared to the current 47.5%, while wisconsin electric's equity component will remain the same. the pscw's order also allowed for escrow accounting treatment for ssr revenue from miso.
in january 2015, certain parties appealed a portion of the pscw's final decision adopting the company's specific rate design changes, including new charges for customer owned generation within its service territory. we believe the appeal is without merit.
2013 wisconsin rate case:   in march 2012, wisconsin electric and wisconsin gas initiated rate proceedings with the pscw. in december 2012, the pscw approved the following rate adjustments:
•   a net bill increase related to non-fuel costs for wisconsin electric's wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $70 million (2.6%) for 2013. this amount reflected an offset of approximately $63 million (2.3%) of bill credits related to the proceeds of the treasury grant, including related tax benefits. absent this offset, the retail electric rate increase for non-fuel costs was approximately $133 million (4.8%) for 2013.
•   an electric rate increase for wisconsin electric's wisconsin retail electric customers of approximately $28 million (1.0%) for 2014, and a $45 million (1.6%) reduction in bill credits.
•   recovery of a forecasted increase in fuel costs of approximately $44 million (1.6%) for 2013.
•   a rate decrease of approximately $8 million (-1.9%) for wisconsin electric's natural gas customers for 2013, with no rate adjustment in 2014. the wisconsin electric rates reflected a $6.4 million reduction in bad debt expense.
•   a rate decrease of approximately $34 million (-5.5%) for wisconsin gas' natural gas customers for 2013, with no rate adjustment in 2014. the wisconsin gas rates reflected a $43.8 million reduction in bad debt expense.
•   an increase of approximately $1.3 million (6.0%) for wisconsin electric's downtown milwaukee (valley) steam utility customers for 2013 and another $1.3 million (6.0%) in 2014.
•   an increase of approximately $1 million (7.0%) in 2013 and $1 million (6.0%) in 2014 for wisconsin electric's milwaukee county steam utility customers.
these rate adjustments were effective january 1, 2013. in addition, wisconsin electric's and wisconsin gas' allowed return on equity remained at 10.4% and 10.5%, respectively. the pscw also approved escrow accounting treatment for the treasury grant.
2012 wisconsin rate case:   in may 2011, wisconsin electric and wisconsin gas filed an application with the pscw to initiate rate proceedings. in lieu of a traditional rate proceeding, we requested an alternative approach, which resulted in no increase in 2012 base rates for our customers. in order for us to proceed under this alternative approach, wisconsin electric and wisconsin gas requested that the pscw issue an order that, among other things:
•   authorized wisconsin electric to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory costs during 2012, with amortization to begin again in 2013.
•   authorized $148 million of carrying costs and depreciation on previously approved air quality and renewable energy projects, effective january 1, 2012.
•   authorized the refund of $26 million of net proceeds from wisconsin electric's settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the doe.
2012 and 2010 michigan rate cases:   in july 2011, wisconsin electric filed a $17.5 million rate increase request with the mpsc, primarily to recover the costs of environmental upgrades and oc 2. pursuant to michigan law, we self-implemented a $5.7 million interim electric base rate increase in january 2012. this increase was partially offset by a refund of $2.7 million of net proceeds from wisconsin electric's settlement of the spent nuclear fuel litigation with the doe, resulting in a net $3.0 million rate increase. in addition, approximately $2.0 million of renewable costs were included in our michigan fuel recovery rate effective january 1, 2012. the mpsc approved a total increase in electric base rates of $9.2 million annually, effective june 27, 2012, and authorized a 10.1% return on equity.
in july 2009, wisconsin electric filed a $42 million rate increase request with the mpsc, primarily to recover the costs of ptf projects. in july 2010, the mpsc issued its final order, approving a total increase of $23.5 million annually, or 14.2%. in august 2010, our largest customers, two iron ore mines, filed an appeal with the mpsc regarding this rate order. in october 2010, the mpsc ruled on the mines' appeal and reduced the rate increase by approximately $0.3 million annually. in november 2010, the mines filed a claim of appeal of the october 2010 order with the michigan court of appeals. in may 2014, the court of appeals issued its decision affirming the mpsc orders in both the 2010 and 2012 rate cases. in august 2014, the mines filed an application for leave to appeal with the michigan supreme court, which application was denied on february 3, 2015.
58      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k michigan ssr proceeding:   on february 10, 2015, the mpsc issued an order and notice of hearing related to the ongoing operation of pipp and the need for us to receive ssr payments with the return of the mines as our retail customers on february 1, 2015. we are unable to predict the resolution of this matter at this time.
for additional information relating to the ssr payments we are receiving, see industry restructuring and competition below.
wisconsin fuel proceedings embedded within wisconsin electric's electric rates is an amount to recover fuel costs. the wisconsin retail fuel rules require the company to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any under-collection or over-collection of fuel costs that are outside of the utility's symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the pscw set at plus or minus 2% of the utility's approved fuel cost plan. the deferred fuel costs are subject to an excess revenues test.
other utility rate matters electric transmission cost recovery:   wisconsin electric divested its transmission assets with the formation of atc in january 2001. we procure transmission service from atc at ferc approved tariff rates. in connection with the formation of atc, our transmission costs escalated due to the allocation of costs over atc's footprint and increased transmission infrastructure requirements in wisconsin. in 2002, in connection with the increased costs experienced by our customers, the pscw issued an order which allowed us to use escrow accounting whereby we deferred transmission costs that exceeded amounts embedded in our rates. we were allowed to earn a return on the unrecovered transmission costs at our weighted-average cost of capital. our 2008 and 2010 pscw rate orders discontinued escrow accounting for prospective transmission charges and provided for recovery of those costs as incurred. in our 2013 wisconsin rate case, the pscw reauthorized escrow accounting for future transmission costs whereby we defer prospective costs that exceed amounts in rates, and we are allowed to earn a return on the incremental unrecovered transmission costs at the short-term debt rate. as of december 31, 2014, we had $32 million of unrecovered transmission costs related to deferrals subsequent to 2012 that earn a return at the short-term debt rate. in addition, as of december 31, 2014, we had $114 million of unrecovered transmission costs related to deferrals prior to 2008 that earn a return at the weighted-average cost of capital. in our 2015 wisconsin rate case, the pscw order reaffirmed our deferral of transmission costs.
gas cost recovery mechanism:   our natural gas operations operate under gcrms as approved by the pscw. generally, the gcrms allow for a dollar for dollar recovery of gas costs. the gcrms use a modified one for one method that measures commodity purchase costs against a monthly benchmark which includes a 2% tolerance. costs in excess of this monthly benchmark are subject to additional review by the pscw before they can be passed through to our customers.
renewables, efficiency and conservation:   in march 2006, wisconsin revised the requirements for renewable energy generation by enacting act 141. act 141 defines "baseline renewable percentage" as the average of an energy provider's renewable energy percentage for 2001, 2002 and 2003. a utility's renewable energy percentage is equal to the amount of its total retail energy sales that are provided by renewable sources. wisconsin electric's baseline renewable energy percentage is 2.27%. under act 141, wisconsin electric was required to increase its renewable energy percentage at least two percentage points to a level of 4.27% for the years 2010-2014. as of december 31, 2014, we are in compliance with the wisconsin renewable energy percentage of 4.27%. act 141 further requires that for the year 2015 and beyond, the renewable energy percentage must increase at least six percentage points above the baseline to a level of 8.27%. act 141 established a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in wisconsin be generated by renewable resources by december 31, 2015. to comply with increasing requirements, wisconsin electric has constructed and contracted for several hundred megawatts of wind generation and constructed a 50 mw biomass facility at domtar corporation's rothschild, wisconsin paper mill site that went into commercial operation in november 2013. wood waste and wood shavings are used to produce renewable electricity and the plant also supports domtar's sustainable papermaking operations. the final cost of completing this project was $268.9 million, excluding afudc. we also own four wind sites, consisting of 200 turbines with an installed capacity of 338 mw and a dependable capability of 66 mw.
we expect to be in compliance with act 141's 2015 standard, and have entered into agreements for renewable energy credits which should allow us to remain in compliance with act 141 through 2022. if market conditions are favorable, we may purchase more renewable energy credits.
59      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k act 141 allows the pscw to delay a utility's implementation of the renewable portfolio standard if it finds that achieving the renewable requirement would result in unreasonable rate increases or would lessen reliability, or that new renewable projects could not be permitted on a timely basis or could not be served by adequate transmission facilities. act 141 provides that if a utility is in compliance with the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements as determined by the pscw, then the utility may not be ordered to achieve additional energy conservation or efficiency.
act 141 also redirects the administration of energy efficiency, conservation and renewable programs from the wisconsin department of administration back to the pscw and/or contracted third parties. in addition, act 141 required that 1.2% of utilities' annual operating revenues be used to fund these programs in 2014. the funding required by act 141 for 2015 is also 1.2% of annual operating revenues.
public act 295 enacted in michigan requires 10% of the state's energy to come from renewables by 2015 and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually by 2015. we are currently in compliance with this requirement. public act 295 specifically calls for current recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost-effective.
electric system reliability we continue to upgrade our electric distribution system, including substations, transformers and lines. we had adequate capacity to meet the miso calculated planning reserve margin during 2014 and 2013. all of our generating plants performed as expected during the warmest periods of the summer and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. during this period, public appeals for conservation were not required and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non-firm customers who participate in load management programs. we expect to have adequate capacity to meet the planning reserve margin requirements during 2015. however, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability across the 15-state miso market footprint could require us to call upon load management procedures.
environmental matters overview consistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. specific environmental issues affecting our utility and non-utility energy segments include but are not limited to current and future regulation of: (1) air emissions such as so2, nox, fine particulates, mercury and greenhouse gases; (2) water discharges; (3) disposal of coal combustion by-products such as fly ash; and (4) remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.
we have continued to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including: (1) the development of additional sources of renewable electric energy supply; (2) the review of water quality matters such as discharge limits and cooling water requirements and implementing improvements to our cooling water intake systems as needed; (3) the addition of emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with new ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules; (4) the conversion of the fuel source for vapp from coal to natural gas; (5) the beneficial use of ash and other solid products from coal-fired generating units; and (6) the clean-up of former manufactured gas plant sites.
air quality epa - consent decree:   in april 2003, wisconsin electric reached a consent decree with the epa, in which it agreed to significantly reduce air emissions from its coal-fired generating facilities. in july 2003, the consent decree was amended to include the state of michigan, and in october 2007, the u.s. district court for the eastern district of wisconsin approved and entered the amended consent decree. the consent decree was further amended in january 2012 to change the point of air monitoring at the oak creek power plant to accommodate the aqcs that began service in 2012. in september 2014, the consent decree was amended a third time to update
60      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k some provisions related to the conversion of vapp from coal to natural gas. in order to achieve the reductions agreed to in the consent decree, over the past 11 years we have installed new pollution control equipment, including the oak creek aqcs, upgraded existing equipment and retired certain older coal units at a cost of approximately $1.2 billion. we do not expect future costs to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
8-hour ozone standards:   in 2008, the epa issued a more stringent 8-hour ozone standard, and made final attainment designations for this revised standard in 2012. sheboygan county and the eastern portion of kenosha county were designated as non-attainment areas. as a result, construction permitting for all of our wisconsin power plants, except the pleasant prairie power plant, is expected to be subject to less stringent permitting requirements. in addition, modifications to these facilities should not be required to obtain emission offsets. so long as eastern kenosha county remains an ozone non-attainment area, the pleasant prairie power plant will continue to be subject to more stringent permitting requirements and offset provisions.
in april 2014, the u.s. district court for the northern district of california adopted a petition from environmental groups to require the epa to propose a new ozone standard by 2014, and to finalize the standard by october 2015. on november 25, 2014, the epa proposed to lower the 8-hour ozone standard from its current level of 75 parts per billion. as part of its proposal, the epa requested comment on values from 60-70 parts per billion. the impact, if any, of a revised standard will depend on how much it is lowered, but could result in widespread areas of the country not being able to meet the new standard.
fine particulate standard:   in 2009, the epa designated three counties in southeast wisconsin (milwaukee, waukesha and racine) as not meeting the daily standard for pm2.5. in april 2012, the epa proposed to determine that these three counties meet the pm2.5 standard, and proposed to suspend the requirement that the state submit a state implementation plan (sip) including reasonably available control technology regulations. in february 2014, the epa re-proposed this determination, and in april 2014, the epa took action to redesignate the three counties to attainment. our generating facilities in the counties are now subject to less stringent construction permitting requirements and emission offset provisions are no longer required for modifications to these facilities. in addition, in december 2012, the epa issued a revised and more stringent annual pm2.5 standard. on december 18, 2014, the epa determined that all areas of wisconsin and michigan's upper peninsula meet the revised standard and designated them as attainment areas. therefore, we do not currently expect the lower standard to impose any additional requirements on our operations.
sulfur dioxide standard:   the epa issued a new 1-hour so2 naaqs that became effective in august 2010. this standard represents a significant change from the previous so2 standard, and naaqs in general, since attainment designations were to be based primarily on modeling rather than monitoring. typically, attainment designations are based on monitored data. in may 2014, the epa issued the proposed data requirements rule that would establish procedures and timelines for implementation of the standard. the proposed rule describes the epa's plans for allowing the states to use either monitoring or modeling to make designations.
we filed comments on the proposed rule with the epa in july 2014, and proposed a special reliability exclusion for pipp that would recognize our request to retire the facility, and would exclude it from further modeling or monitoring requirements and subsequent emission reductions. as proposed, the rule affords state agencies latitude in rule implementation. states would have the option of modeling or monitoring to show attainment (subject to epa approval for this selection). if the state chooses modeling and the sources in an area do not make reductions by 2017, and as a consequence the area is classified as non-attainment, then they would have to make emission reductions by 2023. alternatively, if a state opted out of modeling and instead chose monitoring, and subsequently monitored non-attainment, then it would face a 2026 compliance date. a non-attainment designation could have negative impacts for a localized geographic area, including permitting constraints for the subject source and for other new or existing sources in the area.
we believe our fleet (with the exception of pipp) is well positioned to meet this regulation once it is finalized. if pipp is still operating in the 2021-2022 timeframe, it will likely need additional so2 reductions in order to comply with the standard.
61      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k nitrogen dioxide standard:   in january 2010, the epa announced a new hourly nitrogen dioxide standard, which became effective in april 2010. in february 2012, all areas of wisconsin and michigan were designated as unclassifiable. until these areas are classified as attainment or non-attainment and any potential rules are adopted, we are unable to predict the impact on the operation of our generation facilities.
mercury and other hazardous air pollutants:   in december 2011, the epa issued the final mats rule, which imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, from coal and oil-fired electric generating units. we currently anticipate that only pipp will require modifications, and are planning for the addition of a dry sorbent injection system for further control of mercury and acid gases at the plant to comply with mats. in april 2013, we received a one year mats compliance extension through april 16, 2016 from the mdeq.
in addition, both wisconsin and michigan have mercury rules that require a 90% reduction of mercury, and compliance with those rules will no longer be required after the compliance date for mats.
in january 2013, the epa issued the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for major sources: industrial, commercial, and institutional boilers and process heaters (industrial boiler mact rule). the industrial boiler mact rule imposes stringent limitations on numerous hazardous air pollutants from large boilers that do not meet the definition of electric generating units. the compliance date set forth in the rule is january 31, 2016, but a one year extension of that deadline may be available where emission controls cannot be installed and operational by the compliance date. along with some smaller gas fired boilers in our fleet, the three coal fired boilers at the milwaukee county power plant are subject to this rule. we are currently evaluating compliance options for these boilers.
cross-state air pollution rule:   in august 2011, the epa issued csapr, formerly known as the clean air transport rule. this rule was proposed to replace the clean air interstate rule (cair), which had been remanded to the epa in 2008. the stated purpose of the csapr is to limit the interstate transport of emissions of nox and so2 that contribute to fine particulate matter and ozone non-attainment in downwind states through a proposed allocation plan. in february 2012, the epa issued final technical revisions to the rule and issued a draft final rule which together delay the implementation date for certain penalty provisions that could potentially impact the pipp and increase the number of allowances issued to the states of michigan and wisconsin. we and a number of other parties sought judicial review of the rule. in april 2014, the united states supreme court issued a decision largely upholding the rule and remanding it for further proceedings consistent with the court's order. briefing on further challenges to the rule allowed by the u.s. supreme court decision is ongoing. on october 23, 2014, the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit issued a decision that cleared the way for the epa to begin implementing csapr on january 1, 2015. we expect that there will be sufficient allowances available for pipp to meet its obligations to operate and provide stability to the transmission system in the upper peninsula of michigan. we also expect to have excess allowances available to sell from our wisconsin power plants. in light of these developments, we withdrew our challenge to csapr.
clean air visibility rule:   the epa issued the clean air visibility rule in june 2005 to address regional haze, or regionally-impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area. the rule defines best available retrofit technology (bart) requirements for electric generating units and how bart will be addressed in the 28 states subject to the epa's cair. the pollutants from power plants that reduce visibility include pm2.5 or compounds that contribute to fine particulate formation, nox, so2 and ammonia.
in june 2012, the epa promulgated a federal implementation plan that approves reliance on the csapr to satisfy electric generating unit bart requirements for nox and so2. in december 2012, the epa approved michigan's regional haze sip. in august 2012, the epa approved wisconsin's regional haze sip, which also relies on the csapr to satisfy electric generating unit bart requirements for nox and so2. we believe we are well positioned to meet the requirements of the clean air visibility rule based on air quality control system additions that are already in place or planned for our generating facilities.
62      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k climate change:   we continue to take measures to reduce our emissions of ghg. we support flexible, market-based strategies to curb ghg emissions, including emissions trading, emission offset projects and credit for early actions. we support an approach that encourages technology development and transfer and includes all sectors of the economy and all significant global emitters. we have taken, and continue to take, several steps to reduce our emissions of ghg, including:
•   added coal-fired units as part of the oak creek expansion that are the most thermally efficient coal units in our system.
•   added renewable capacity.
federal, state, regional and international authorities have undertaken efforts to limit ghg emissions. the regulation of ghg emissions continues to be a top priority for the president's administration.
in accordance with instructions from the president, the epa is pursuing regulation of ghg emissions using its existing authority under the caa. in september 2013, the epa issued new proposed new source performance standards with ghg limits for new fossil fueled power plants. the rule would not apply to certain natural gas fueled peaking plants, biomass units or oil fueled stationary combustion turbines. based upon currently available technology and the emission limits in the proposed rule, we believe that this rule effectively prohibits new conventional coal-fired power plants.
in addition, the epa issued proposed guidelines relating to ghg emissions from existing generating units in june 2014, and has announced plans to issue final rules by mid-summer 2015. the epa also published proposed performance standards for modified and reconstructed generating units. the proposed guidelines for existing fossil generating units seek to attain state-specific ghg rate reductions by 2030, and require states to submit plans as early as june 30, 2016. single states requesting a one year extension would be required to submit plans by june 30, 2017, and states that are part of a multi-state plan that request a two year extension would be required to submit plans by june 30, 2018. the epa is seeking ghg rate reductions in wisconsin of 34% and in michigan of 31% by 2030, with interim reduction goals beginning in 2020 of 30% and 27% respectively, with interim goal compliance determined by averaging reductions over the ten year period of 2020 to 2029. the proposed program consists of building blocks that include a combination of power plant efficiency improvements, increased reliance on combined cycle gas units, adding new renewable energy resources, and increased demand side management. we are in the process of reviewing the proposed guidelines to determine the potential impacts to our operations, but the guidelines as currently proposed could result in significant additional compliance costs, including capital expenditures, impact how we operate our existing fossil fueled power plants and biomass facility, and could have a material adverse impact on our operating costs.
in june 2014, the u.s. supreme court struck down a portion of the epa's program for permitting ghg emissions under the prevention of significant deterioration (psd) and title v programs. the court held that a facility's ghg emissions alone cannot trigger a requirement to obtain a permit and that the epa did not have the authority to "tailor" the statutory permitting thresholds. the court also upheld those portions of the epa's program that provide for implementation of ghg emissions limits based on the application of bart for facilities already subject to psd or title v permitting requirements for other pollutants. we do not expect that this decision will have a material impact on our facilities.
we are required to report our co2 equivalent emissions from our electric generating facilities under the epa greenhouse gases reporting program. for 2013, we reported co2 equivalent emissions of approximately 21.9 million metric tonnes to the epa, compared with approximately 18.1 million metric tonnes for 2012. based upon our preliminary analysis of the data, we estimate that we will report co2 equivalent emissions of approximately 23.3 million metric tonnes to the epa for 2014. the level of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions vary from year to year and are dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed and how our units are dispatched by miso.
63      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k we are also required to report co2 equivalent amounts related to the natural gas our gas utility distributes and sells. for 2013, we reported approximately 10.4 million metric tonnes of co2 equivalent to the epa related to our distribution and sale of natural gas, compared with approximately 8.4 million metric tonnes for 2012. based upon our preliminary analysis of the monitoring data, we estimate that we will report co2 emissions of approximately 10.8 million metric tonnes to the epa for 2014.
valley power plant conversion:   in august 2012, we announced plans to convert the fuel source for vapp from coal to natural gas. we currently expect the cost of this conversion to be between $65 million and $70 million, excluding afudc. we received pscw approval for this project in march 2014. construction related to the conversion of the first two boilers was completed in november 2014, and the remaining two boilers are scheduled for completion in 2015.
for further information, see note q -- commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
water quality clean water act:   section 316(b) of the clean water act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available (bta) for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. the epa finalized rules for new facilities (phase i) in 2001. the epa issued a final phase ii rule that became effective on october 14, 2014. the new rule applies to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures, except for the oak creek expansion units, which were permitted under the phase i rules.
the new phase ii rule allows facility owners to select from seven options available to meet the impingement mortality (im) reduction standard. bta determinations will be made over the next several years by the wdnr and mdeq, subject to epa oversight, when facility permits are reissued. based upon our assessment, we believe that the existing technologies at our generating facilities will allow us to demonstrate that, other than vapp, all of our facilities satisfy the im bta standard. during 2015 and 2016, we plan to install fish protection screens at vapp that will meet the im bta standard.
the bta determinations for entrainment mortality (em) reduction will be made by the wdnr and mdeq on a case-by-case basis. the new rule requires state permitting agencies to determine em bta on a site-specific basis taking into consideration several factors. we have received an em bta determination by the wdnr, with epa concurrence, for our proposed intake modification at vapp. we cannot yet determine what, if any, intake structure or operational modifications will be required to meet the new requirements for our other generating facilities.
the wdnr issued a new wisconsin pollutant discharge elimination system (wpdes) permit for vapp that became effective on january 1, 2013 that contains several additional requirements. effluent toxicity testing and monitoring for additional parameters (phosphorous, mercury and ammonia-nitrogen), and a new heat addition limit from the cooling water discharges all took effect immediately. longer term compliance requirements include thermal discharge studies, phosphorous evaluation and feasibility for reduction, mercury minimization planning and a compliance schedule for the installation of the new cooling water intake fish protection screens.
on november 10, 2014, the wdnr reissued the wpdes permit for the psgs. we believe that the wdnr imposed unreasonable permit conditions with respect to temperature monitoring, the control of water treatment additive and phosphorus discharges.
to address these permit conditions, we filed a petition for a contested case hearing with the wdnr on january 9, 2015. on the same day, we also filed a request to be covered by the statewide phosphorus variance to address one of our concerns with the permit. we are working with the wdnr to determine if a settlement is possible. a decision on the phosphorus variance request is pending.
steam electric effluent guidelines:   these guidelines regulate waste water discharges from our power plant processes. in june 2013, the epa issued a proposed rule for comment to modify these guidelines. we submitted comments primarily addressing potential effects to our wastewater treatment facilities and coal combustion residuals effluent management activities. the rules are expected to be finalized by september 2015. after promulgation of the final rules, the wdnr and mdeq will need to modify state rules accordingly and then
64      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k incorporate new requirements into our facility permits. the rule compliance deadline is as soon as possible after july 1, 2017 with full compliance expected by july 1, 2022. we already meet many of the proposed requirements defined by the epa, and as a result believe we will be well positioned to comply with the proposed guidelines. there are several available options outlined in the proposed rule. the amount of additional costs we may need to incur to comply with the new guidelines, if any, will depend on which option(s) the epa selects to incorporate into the final guidelines. until the rules are finalized, we are unable to determine the impact on our facilities.
land quality new coal combustion products regulation:   we currently have a program of beneficial utilization for substantially all of our coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, which minimizes the need for disposal in specially-designed landfills. both wisconsin and michigan have regulations governing the use and disposal of these materials. in 2010, the epa issued draft rules for public comment proposing two alternative rules for regulating coal combustion products, one of which would classify the materials as hazardous waste. the epa issued the final rule on december 22, 2014, under which coal combustion residuals will be regulated as a non-hazardous waste. the rule is self-implementing which means that affected facilities must comply with the rules regardless of whether a state adopts the rule. we have been meeting the state requirements and have plans in place to implement the additional federal rule requirements.
in the preamble to the final rule, the epa referenced reports it received with respect to the molybdenum concerns raised in southeastern wisconsin, and indicated it will continue to evaluate the beneficial use of coal ash in unencapsulated construction.
manufactured gas plant sites:   we continue to voluntarily review and address environmental conditions at a number of former manufactured gas plant sites. for further information, see note q -- commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
ash landfill sites:   we seek environmentally acceptable, beneficial uses for our combustion byproducts. for further information, see note q -- commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
legal matters stray voltage:   on july 11, 1996, the pscw issued a final order regarding the stray voltage policies of wisconsin's investor-owned utilities. the order clarified the definition of stray voltage, affirmed the level at which utility action is required, and placed some of the responsibility for this issue in the hands of the customer. additionally, the order established a uniform stray voltage tariff which delineates utility responsibility and provides for the recovery of costs associated with unnecessary customer demanded services.
dairy farmers have made claims against wisconsin electric for loss of milk production and other damages to livestock allegedly caused by stray voltage and ground currents resulting from the operation of its electrical system, even though that electrical system has been operated within the parameters of the pscw's order. the wisconsin supreme court has rejected the arguments that, if a utility company's measurement of stray voltage is below the pscw "level of concern," that utility could not be found negligent in stray voltage cases. additionally, the court has held that the pscw regulations regarding stray voltage were only minimum standards to be considered by a jury in stray voltage litigation. as a result of these rulings, claims by dairy farmers for livestock damage have been based upon ground currents with levels measuring less than the pscw "level of concern." we continue to evaluate various options and strategies to mitigate this risk.
on september 9, 2014, a new stray voltage case was filed against wisconsin electric in sheboygan county, wisconsin. we do not believe this lawsuit has any merit and intend to defend the case vigorously. this lawsuit is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.
65      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k industry restructuring and competition electric utility industry the regulated energy industry continues to experience significant changes. ferc continues to support large rtos, which affects the structure of the wholesale market. to this end, miso implemented the miso energy markets, including the use of lmp to value electric transmission congestion and losses. the miso energy markets commenced operation in april 2005 for energy distribution and in january 2009 for operating reserves. increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us. it is uncertain when retail access might be implemented, if at all, in wisconsin; however, michigan has adopted retail choice.
restructuring in wisconsin:   electric utility revenues in wisconsin are regulated by the pscw. the pscw has been focused on electric reliability infrastructure issues for the state of wisconsin in recent years. the pscw continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the wisconsin legislature. no such legislation has been introduced in wisconsin to date.
michigan business michigan settlement:   on january 12, 2015, wisconsin energy and wisconsin electric entered into an agreement with the governor of the state of michigan, the attorney general of the state of michigan, the staff of the mpsc, and tilden mining company and empire iron mining partnership, owners of the two mines in the upper peninsula of michigan, to resolve all objections these parties raised at the ferc and the mpsc related to wisconsin energy's proposed acquisition of integrys. the agreement forms the basis for a settlement agreement between the parties and includes the following provisions which directly impact wisconsin energy and wisconsin electric:
•   the governor, the attorney general and the owners of the mines will each file a letter with ferc stating that they do not have any objection to ferc's approval of our acquisition of integrys, and will refrain from taking any action at ferc seeking to oppose, otherwise condition or delay consummation of the transaction. these letters have been filed with ferc.
•   the settlement agreement will request that the mpsc order approving our acquisition of integrys be subject to the following conditions: (i) the closing of the sale of wisconsin electric's michigan electric distribution assets and pipp to upper peninsula power company (uppco) contemporaneously with the closing of the acquisition of integrys; (ii) the closing of the sale of wisconsin public service corporation's michigan electric distribution assets to uppco contemporaneously with the closing of the acquisition; and (iii) termination of the pipp ssr agreement between miso and wisconsin electric no later than the closing date of the acquisition. to this end, wisconsin electric has entered into a non-binding term sheet to sell these assets to uppco, which is described in more detail below. the attorney general, the mpsc staff and the owners of the mines will not seek or support any other conditions on granting of mpsc approval of our acquisition of integrys. wisconsin public service corporation is a subsidiary of integrys.
ssr payments:   under michigan law, our retail customers may choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. the law limits customer choice to 10% of our michigan retail load. the two iron ore mines are excluded from this cap. when a customer switches to an alternative electric supplier, we continue to provide distribution and customer service functions for the customer.
in august 2013, the mines, which were served on an interruptible tariff, notified us that they intended to switch to an alternative electric supplier. in september 2013, the switch was made. in addition, other smaller retail customers have switched to an alternative electric supplier. following that decision, we initiated discussions with miso to compensate wisconsin electric for the continued short-term operation of the plant through 2014.
in august 2013, we filed a request with miso to suspend the operation of all five units at pipp. in october 2013, miso informed us that the operation of all units is necessary to maintain reliability in the upper peninsula of michigan.
66      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k in january 2014, we entered into an ssr agreement (suspension) with miso to recover costs for operating and maintaining the units. the agreement was effective february 1, 2014, had a one year term, and specified monthly payments to wisconsin electric of $4.4 million to cover fixed costs. the agreement also provided for the payment of our variable costs to operate and maintain the plant. miso filed the ssr agreement with ferc, and on april 1, 2014, ferc conditionally accepted the agreement as filed, subject to further review and ferc order. we began receiving ssr payments from miso in the second quarter of 2014 retroactive to the agreement's effective date of february 1, 2014.
in addition, we issued a request for proposals regarding the potential purchase of pipp in january 2014. we did not receive any valid proposals by the march 3, 2014 deadline. based upon our evaluation and the lack of interest to purchase the plant, in april 2014, we filed a request with miso to retire pipp effective october 15, 2014. in may 2014, miso informed us that they had determined the operation of all five units at pipp was necessary for reliability purposes; therefore, the units would continue to be designated as ssr units.
we entered into a new ssr agreement (retirement) with miso, effective october 15, 2014, that covered the operating costs of pipp through december 2015. the new ssr agreement also included, among other things, costs to comply with the mats rule and a return on and of our investment in the plant. the new agreement is based on projected costs and is subject to a true-up mechanism. the estimated monthly payments under this agreement are approximately $8.1 million. on november 10, 2014, ferc accepted the new ssr agreement, but it is subject to further action.
miso is responsible for allocating the ssr costs to various market participants within the miso footprint consistent with ferc approved tariffs. several interested parties, including the pscw and the mpsc, filed complaints with the ferc regarding the allocation among the different jurisdictions of the ssr costs associated with the continued operation of pipp. on february 19, 2015, ferc acted on the jurisdictional allocation of the ssr costs, reaffirming that it is unjust and unreasonable to allocate ssr costs pro rata to all market participants and that ssr costs must be allocated to the load-serving entities that require the operation of ssr units for reliability purposes. ferc directed miso to file a new study method to identify the entities that benefit from the operation of ssr units within 60 days of the decision date and to allocate the costs directly to these entities.
on february 17, 2015, we entered into an agreement with the owners of the two iron ore mines whereby we agreed to request termination of the ssr agreement effective february 1, 2015, and the two mines agreed to remain full requirements customers until the earlier of the sale of pipp and july 31, 2015. on the same date, we requested miso to terminate the ssr agreement, and on february 18, 2015, miso filed a request with ferc to have the ssr terminated effective february 1, 2015. we do not expect the termination of the ssr agreement to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
effective february 1, 2015, the mines returned as retail customers. we expect to defer the net revenue from those sales and will apply these amounts for the benefit of wisconsin retail electric customers in future rate proceedings. michigan state law allows the mines to switch to an alternative electric supplier after sufficient notice.
sale of michigan assets:   in january 2015, we entered into a non-binding term sheet to sell our michigan electric distribution assets and pipp to uppco. we currently expect to enter into a definitive agreement by the end of march 2015. the ultimate sale of these assets would have to be approved by several state and federal regulatory bodies, including the mpsc, pscw and ferc. if the sale is consummated on terms commensurate with the non-binding term sheet, consistent with the treatment that would be applied to a generating unit retirement we will seek recovery of approximately $190 million of net unrecovered plant costs.
we believe that the sale of these assets is in the best interest of our customers because of the costs associated with the next best solution, which includes operating pipp for at least five more years. these costs would include ongoing operating costs, decommissioning and dismantling costs and any increased costs for additional transmission capacity in the upper peninsula.
electric transmission, capacity and energy markets in connection with its status as a ferc approved rto, miso developed bid-based energy markets, which were implemented on april 1, 2005. in january 2009, miso commenced the energy and operating reserves markets,
67      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k which includes the bid-based energy markets and an ancillary services market. we previously self-provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. in the miso ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. the miso ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the miso footprint. the miso ancillary services market has enabled miso to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control.
in miso, base transmission costs are currently being paid by load-serving entities located in the service territories of each miso transmission owner. ferc has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the miso footprint.
we, along with others, have sought rehearing and/or appeal of the ferc's various revenue sufficiency guarantee orders related to the determination that miso had applied its energy markets tariff correctly in the assessment of the charges. the net effects of any final determination by ferc or the courts are uncertain at this time.
as part of miso, a market-based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the lmp system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid-atlantic states. the lmp system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through auction revenue rights (arrs) and financial transmission rights (ftrs). arrs are allocated to market participants by miso and ftrs are purchased through auctions. a new allocation and auction were completed for the period of june 1, 2014 through may 31, 2015. the resulting arr valuation and the secured ftrs are expected to mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.
beginning june 1, 2013, miso instituted an annual zonal resource adequacy requirement to ensure there is sufficient generation capacity to serve the miso market. to meet this requirement, capacity resources could be acquired through miso's annual capacity auction, bilateral contracts for capacity, or provided from generating or demand response resources. our capacity requirements during 2014 were fulfilled using our own capacity resources.
natural gas utility industry restructuring in wisconsin:   the pscw previously instituted generic proceedings to consider how its regulation of gas distribution utilities should change to reflect a competitive environment in the natural gas industry. to date, the pscw has made a policy decision to deregulate the sale of natural gas in customer segments with workably competitive market choices and has adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its gas marketing affiliates. however, work on deregulation of the gas distribution industry by the pscw continues to be on hold. currently, we are unable to predict the impact of potential future deregulation on our results of operations or financial position.
other matters paris generating station units 1 and 4 temporary outage:  between 2000 and 2002, we replaced the blades on the four psgs combustion turbine generators with blades that were approximately 7% more efficient. the work was performed as routine maintenance that we did not believe required a construction permit at the time and the plant has not been operated to use the potential additional capacity; however, in january 2013, the wdnr indicated that it considered this maintenance to be a modification requiring a construction permit. this matter has since been settled. in december 2013, act 91 was signed into law in wisconsin, creating a process by which the epa and wdnr were able to revise the regulations and emissions rates applicable to units 1 and 4, allowing those units to restart. we received an "after the fact" permit from the wdnr, and the units are now available for service. on october 24, 2014, the sierra club filed for a contested case hearing with the wdnr challenging this permit.

treasury grant:   in december 2013, we filed an application with the united states treasury for a treasury grant related to the construction of our biomass facility, which was placed into service in november 2013. in december 2013, we recognized income related to the treasury grant and we deferred as a regulatory liability the grant proceeds that would be returned to customers subsequent to december 31, 2013. in connection with our wisconsin retail electric rates that became effective january 1, 2013, our wisconsin retail electric customers began receiving bill credits for the expected grant proceeds plus the related tax benefits.
in june 2014, we received approximately $76.2 million related to the treasury grant. the pscw approved escrow accounting for the treasury grant and the proceeds we received that exceeded the amounts originally included in rates are being returned to customers in the form of bill credits.
as noted above, our wisconsin retail electric customers are currently receiving bill credits related to the treasury grant plus related tax benefits. during 2014, we recognized treasury grant income to match the bill credits related to the grant that our wisconsin retail electric customers received.
critical accounting estimates preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with gaap requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. the application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. these judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions. in addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of our business, but on our results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed.
the following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:
regulatory accounting:   our utility subsidiaries operate under rates established by state and federal regulatory commissions which are designed to recover the cost of service and provide a reasonable return to investors. the actions of our regulators may allow us to defer costs that non-regulated entities would expense and accrue liabilities that non-regulated companies would not. as of december 31, 2014, we had $1,271.2 million in regulatory assets and $830.6 million in regulatory liabilities. in the future, if we move to market based rates, or if the actions of our regulators change, we may conclude that we are unable to follow regulatory accounting. in this situation, we would record the regulatory assets related to unrecognized pension and opeb costs as a reduction of equity, after tax. the balance of our regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities would be recorded as an extraordinary after-tax non-cash charge to earnings. we continually review the applicability of regulatory accounting and have determined that it is currently appropriate to continue following it. in addition, each quarter we perform a review of our regulatory assets and our regulatory environment and we evaluate whether we believe that it is probable that we will recover the regulatory assets in future rates. see note c -- regulatory assets and liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
pension and opeb:   our reported costs of providing non-contributory defined pension benefits (described in note n -- benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements) are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to plans and earnings on plan assets. changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension costs. pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, mortality and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.
69      wisconsin energy corporation item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - (cont'd)   2014 form 10-k changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. as such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants.
the following table reflects pension plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.

0.5% decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets       $6.8
in addition to pension plans, we maintain opeb plans which provide health and life insurance benefits for retired employees (described in note n -- benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements). our reported costs of providing these post-retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience including employee age and other demographics, our contributions to the plans, earnings on plan assets and health care cost trends. changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future opeb costs. opeb costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, mortality and the discount rates used in determining the opeb and post-retirement costs. our opeb plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. fluctuations in actual equity market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased other post-retirement costs in future periods. similar to accounting for pension plans, the regulators of our utility segment have adopted accounting guidance for compensation related to retirement benefits for rate-making purposes.
the following table reflects opeb plan sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage. each sensitivity reflects a change to the given assumption, holding all other assumptions constant.

in october 2014, the society of actuaries released a new set of mortality tables (rp-2014) and an accompanying mortality improvement scale (mp-2014), which incorporates increasing life expectancy experience in the united states. based on our initial review of the proposed tables, we believe our pension and opeb obligations would increase by approximately 6% if we adopted these tables. we will continue to evaluate the mortality assumptions in the future, as necessary, to conform to our experience.
unbilled revenues:   we record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. however, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. at the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. this unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. total utility operating revenues during 2014 of approximately $4.9 billion included accrued utility revenues of $291.3 million as of december 31, 2014.

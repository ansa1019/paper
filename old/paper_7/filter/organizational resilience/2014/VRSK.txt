item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, as well as the discussion under "selected consolidated financial data." this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in or implied by any of the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those listed under "risk factors" and "special note regarding forward-looking statements."
we enable risk-bearing businesses to better understand and manage their risks and opportunities associated with those risks. we provide value to our customers by supplying proprietary data that, combined with our analytic methods, creates embedded decision support solutions. we are the largest aggregator and provider of data pertaining to u.s. property and casualty, or p&c, insurance risks. we offer solutions for detecting fraud in the u.s. p&c insurance, financial services and healthcare industries and sophisticated methods to predict and quantify loss in diverse contexts ranging from natural catastrophes to supply chain to health insurance.
our customers use our solutions to make better risk decisions with greater efficiency and discipline. we refer to these products and services as "solutions" due to the integration among our products and the flexibility that enables our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive package of products. these solutions take various forms, including data, statistical models or tailored analytics, all designed to allow our clients to make more logical decisions. we believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our customers' revenues and help them better manage their costs.
on may 23, 2008, in contemplation of our ipo, insurance service office, inc., or iso, formed verisk analytics, inc., or verisk, a delaware corporation, to be the holding company for our business. verisk was initially formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of iso. on october 6, 2009 in connection with our ipo, we effected a reorganization whereby iso became a wholly-owned subsidiary of verisk.
on october 1, 2010, we completed a follow-on public offering. we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock in the offering. the primary purpose of the offering was to manage and organize the sale by class b insurance company shareholders while providing incremental public float. concurrently with the closing of the offering, we repurchased shares of common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $192.5 million, directly from selling shareholders owning class b common stock. we converted all class b shares to class a shares in 2011 and currently have no outstanding class b shares.
we organize our business in two segments: risk assessment and decision analytics. our risk assessment segment provides statistical, actuarial and underwriting data for the u.s. p&c insurance industry. our risk assessment segment revenues represented approximately 37.2% and 38.7% of our revenues for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. effective december 31, 2012, we combined the statistical agency and data services and actuarial services into industry-standard insurance programs within our risk assessment segment. our decision analytics segment provides solutions our customers use to analyze the processes of the verisk risk analysis framework: prediction of loss, detection and prevention of fraud, and
quantification of loss. our decision analytics segment revenues represented approximately 62.8% and 61.3% of our revenues for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
in january 2014, we entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the stock of eagleview technology corporation, or evt, the parent company of pictometry international corp., and eagle view technologies, inc. for a net cash purchase price of $650 million, which would have been funded by the company's operating cash and borrowings from our credit facility. evt is a provider of geo-referenced aerial image capture and visual-centric data analytics and solutions to insurers, contractors, government, and commercial customers in the united states. on december 16, 2014, we ended our efforts to acquire evt following the vote by the federal trade commission, or ftc, to challenge the transaction.
on march 11, 2014, we sold our mortgage services business, interthinx, inc., or interthinx. from 2009 to 2011, the mortgage services business was in both risk assessment segment within the insurance services revenue category and decision analytics segment in the financial services revenue category. in 2012, we reclassified the appraisal mortgage tools from risk assessment to our decision analytics segment in the financial services revenue category. therefore, in 2012 and 2013, the mortgage services business is within decision analytics segment. results of operations for the mortgage services business are reported as a discontinued operation for the year ended december 31, 2014 and for all prior periods presented. see note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k. as necessary, the amounts have been retroactively adjusted in all periods presented to give recognition to the discontinued operations.
executive summary key performance metrics we believe our business's ability to generate recurring revenue and positive cash flow is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy. we use year over year revenue growth and ebitda margin as metrics to measure our performance. ebitda and ebitda margin are non-gaap financial measures (see note 3. within item 6. selected financial data section of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations).
revenue growth. we use year over year revenue growth as a key performance metric. we assess revenue growth based on our ability to generate increased revenue through increased sales to existing customers, sales to new customers, sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers and strategic acquisitions of new businesses.
ebitda margin. we use ebitda margin as a metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our business. we assess ebitda margin based on our ability to increase revenues while controlling expense growth.
revenues we earn revenues through subscriptions, long-term agreements and on a transactional basis. subscriptions for our solutions are generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year. as a result, the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive subscription payments. examples of these arrangements include subscriptions that allow our customers to access our standardized coverage language, our claims fraud database or our actuarial services throughout the subscription period. in general, we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the business. our long-term agreements are generally for periods of three to five years. we recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the term of the subscription and most long-term agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.
certain of our solutions are also paid for by our customers on a transactional basis. for example, we have solutions that allow our customers to obtain property-specific rating and underwriting information to price a policy on a commercial building, or compare a p&c insurance, medical or workers' compensation claim with information in our databases. for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, 27.7% and 26.4% of our revenues, respectively, were derived from providing transactional solutions. we earn transactional revenues as our solutions are delivered or services performed. in general, transactions are billed monthly at the end of each month.
approximately 89.6% and 88.2% of the revenues in our risk assessment segment for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were derived from subscriptions and long-term agreements for our solutions. our customers in this segment include most of the p&c insurance providers in the united states. approximately 61.9% and 64.4% of the revenues in our decision analytics segment, for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were derived from subscriptions and long-term agreements for our solutions. in this segment, customer bases are within the insurance, healthcare, financial services and specialized markets verticals.
principal operating costs and expenses personnel expenses are the major component of both our cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses. personnel expenses, which represented 56.8% and 59.7% of our total expenses for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, include salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, equity compensation costs, sales commissions, employment taxes, recruiting costs, and outsourced temporary agency costs.
we allocate personnel expenses between two categories, cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative costs, based on the actual costs associated with each employee. we categorize employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues, and all other personnel, including executive managers, sales people, marketing, business development, finance, legal, human resources, and administrative services, as selling, general and administrative expenses. a significant portion of our other operating costs, such as facilities and communications, are also either captured within cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expense based on the nature of the work being performed.
while we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunities, we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues. historically, our ebitda margin has improved because we have been able to increase revenues without a proportionate corresponding increase in expenses. however, part of our corporate strategy is to invest in new solutions which may offset margin expansion.
cost of revenues. our cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses. cost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and verification of data, the maintenance of our existing solutions and the development and enhancement of our next-generation solutions. our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.
selling, general and administrative expense. our selling, general and administrative expense also consists primarily of personnel costs. a portion of the other operating costs such as facilities, insurance and communications are also allocated to selling, general and administrative costs based on the nature of the work being performed by the employee. our selling, general and administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization.
trends affecting our business we serve customers in three primary vertical markets: property/casualty insurance, healthcare, and financial services. the industry trends in each of those markets can affect our business.
a significant change in property/casualty insurers' profitability could positively or negatively affect demand for our solutions. for insurers, the keys to profitability include investment income and premium growth. investment income remains under pressure as a result of low interest rates. growth in property/casualty insurers' direct written premiums is cyclical, with total industry premium growth receding from a peak of 14.8% in 2002 to a trough of negative 3.1% in 2009 and subsequently recovering to 4.4% in 2012 and then receding to 4.3% in 2013 and 3.8% through nine-months 2014. based on our experience, insurers more closely scrutinize their spending in periods of more challenging growth. in recent years, we have signed multi-year contracts with certain customers, and pricing is fixed at the beginning of each multi-year period; pricing for other customers is still linked to prior years' premiums.
trends in catastrophe and noncatastrophe weather losses can have an effect on our customers' profitability and therefore their appetite for buying analytics to help them manage their risks. the apparent increase in the frequency and severity of weather events that cause losses for insurers could lead to increased demand for our catastrophe modeling, catastrophe loss information, and repair cost solutions. a significant decrease in the number or severity of catastrophes could negatively affect our revenues. we also have a portion of our revenue related to the number of claims processed due to losses which can be impacted by seasonal storm activity. the need by our customers to fight insurance fraud - both in claims and at policy inception - could lead to increased demand for our underwriting and claims solutions.
trends in the u.s. healthcare market can affect a portion of our revenues in the decision analytics segment. that market is undergoing significant change as the result of healthcare reform legislation. the specific trends we see affecting our current healthcare business include payment reform, expansion of insurance coverage, and efforts at cost containment. payment reform will likely drive the market to value-based reimbursement and require healthcare providers to bear increased financial risk and responsibility for quality outcomes. the expansion of insurance eligibility will increase medicaid rolls and promote participation in statewide health exchanges. and as the government seeks to control fraud, waste, and abuse, efforts to contain costs will likely become more prevalent. although such changes have the potential to disrupt the healthcare marketplace, we believe the requirements for reform could increase demand for our analytic solutions in the areas of population management, quality measurement provider/payer risk sharing and value-based payment management, medicare advantage revenue management and compliance, risk adjustment, and detection of prepayment fraud and abuse. we experience seasonality in our medicare advantage business tied to third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year, related to cms deadlines.
u.s. and global market trends can influence the revenue composition and growth trajectory of our financial services vertical. recent focus of global regulators on basel-iii compliance and us regulators on compliance to recently adopted 2009 dodd-frank laws on anti-money laundering, stress testing and capital adequacy have led to a significant shift of our data-hosting solution toward the meeting of those specific needs of our bank clients. we expect that a rising interest rate environment is likely to put a significant margin pressure on our bank clients, and can resultantly impact their marketing budgets for growth. however, a strengthening american economy is likely to spur increased lending and could likely offset some of that budgetary risk. trends associated with the strengthening u.s. dollar relative to several other international currencies (u.k., canadian, australian and new zealand) is putting a downward pressure on our revenues from bank clients from overseas markets. lastly, a longer term shift of advertising spend from tv and radio toward digital media has resulted in a greater opportunity for our partnerships and media effectiveness line of businesses.
description of acquisitions we acquired seven businesses since january 1, 2012. as a result of these acquisitions, our consolidated results of operations may not be comparable between periods.
on december 8, 2014, we acquired 100% of the stock of maplecroft.net limited, or maplecroft. using a proprietary data aggregation and analytical approach, maplecroft enables its customers to assess, monitor, and forecast a growing range of worldwide risks, including geopolitical and societal risks. within our decision analytics segment, this acquisition positions us as a provider of value chain optimization tools, providing comprehensive quantitative risk analytics and platforms by which customers can visualize, quantify, mitigate, and manage their risk. maplecroft is headquartered in bath, england. see note 9. to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for the preliminary purchases price allocations.

ebitda margin the ebitda margin for our risk assessment segment was 56.7% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 56.1% for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in margin is primarily attributed to operating leverage in the segment as well as cost efficiencies.
consolidated results of continuing operations revenues revenues were $1,595.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to $1,407.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, an increase of $187.9 million or 13.3%. in 2012, we acquired mediconnect, alp, and argus, collectively referred to as recent acquisitions, which we define as acquisitions not owned for a significant portion of both the current period and/or prior period and would therefore impact the comparability of the financial results. mediconnect was included as a recent acquisition only for the first quarter of 2013; alp was included as a recent acquisition in the first and second quarters of 2013; argus was included as a recent acquisition in the first, second and third quarters of 2013 as full quarter comparable revenues did not exist until certain quarters of 2012 due to the timing of the acquisitions.
these recent acquisitions were within our decision analytics segment and provided an increase of $68.1 million in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2013. excluding recent acquisitions, revenues increased $119.8 million or 8.5%, which included an increase in our decision analytics segment of $81.0 million or 9.8% and an increase in our risk assessment segment of $38.8 million or 6.7%. revenue growth within decision analytics was primarily driven by increases in our healthcare revenue category and contributions from our insurance revenue category. both categories, industry-standard insurance programs and property-specific rating and underwriting information, within risk assessment contributed to its revenue growth. refer to the results of continuing operations by segment within this section for further information regarding our revenues.
cost of revenues cost of revenues was $622.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to $516.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, an increase of $105.8 million or 20.5%. recent acquisitions all within the decision analytics segment, accounted for an increase of $36.8 million in cost of revenues for the year ended december 31, 2013 which were primarily related to salaries and employee benefits. excluding the impact of our recent acquisitions, our cost of revenues increased $69.0 million or 13.4%. the increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits cost of $36.6 million. other increases include data costs and data processing fees of $17.7 million, information technology expense of $7.4 million, travel and travel related costs of $3.2 million and other operating costs of $4.1 million.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses, or sga, were $229.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to $220.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, an increase of $8.9 million or 4.1%. recent acquisitions accounted for an increase of $3.8 million, which was primarily related to professional fees. excluding costs associated with our recent acquisitions, sga increased $5.1 million or 2.3%. the increase was primarily due to an increase in professional fees of $3.0 million, travel and travel related items of $0.8 million, salaries and employee benefits of $0.7 million, and other general and administrative expenses of $0.6 million.
the increase in salaries and benefits of $0.7 million includes an increase of $5.1 million in annual salaries increases, medical costs and commissions, offset by a decrease in our stock option expense of $4.1 million. our stock option expense decreased as a result of lower accelerated vesting of equity awards granted to employees at age 62. other decreases include a decrease in pension expense of $0.3 million, primarily due to our pension plan freeze.
depreciation and amortization of fixed assets depreciation and amortization of fixed assets was $66.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to $46.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, an increase of $19.6 million or 41.9%. depreciation and amortization of fixed assets includes depreciation of furniture and equipment, software, computer hardware, and related equipment. the majority of the increase relates to software and hardware costs to support data capacity expansion and revenue growth.
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was $63.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to $52.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, an increase of $11.5 million or 22.1%. the increase was primarily related to amortization of intangible assets associated with recent acquisitions of $16.0 million, partially offset by $4.5 million of amortization of intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions that have been fully amortized.
investment income and others investment income and realized gain on securities, net, was a gain of $0.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to a gain of $0.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, an increase of $0.5 million.
interest expense interest expense was $76.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to $72.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, an increase of $3.6 million or 5.0%. this increase is primarily due to the issuance of our senior notes in september 2012 with an aggregate principal balance of $350.0 million, partially offset by the repayment of $180.0 million of private placement debt during the year.
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was $196.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to $182.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, an increase of $14.0 million or 7.7%. the effective tax rate was 36.5% for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to 36.5% for the year ended december 31, 2012.
results of continuing operations by segment decision analytics revenues revenues for our decision analytics segment were $977.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to $828.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, an increase of $149.1 million or 18.0%. recent acquisitions accounted for an increase of $68.1 million in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2013. excluding recent acquisitions, our decision analytics revenue increased $81.0 million or 9.8%. as described, our results in the decision analytics segment give effect to discontinued operations of our mortgage services business, which was part of our financial services vertical.

our insurance revenue increased $45.7 million or 9.3%, and excluding recent acquisitions (alp) revenue of $1.2 million for the first and second quarters within this category, our insurance revenue increased $44.5 million or 9.0%, primarily due to an increase within our underwriting solutions, an increase in catastrophe modeling services for existing customers, as well an increase in insurance fraud solutions revenue, and an increase in loss quantification solutions.
our financial services revenue increased $54.5 million or 205.3%, and excluding recent acquisitions (argus) revenue of $50.1 million for the first, second and third quarters within this category, our financial services revenue increased $4.4 million
or 20.2%. this financial services revenue reflects argus' increased solutions which became part of organic revenue in the fourth quarter.
our healthcare revenue increased $48.6 million or 21.8%, and excluding the recent acquisitions (mediconnect) revenue for the first quarter of $16.8 million within this category, our healthcare revenue increased $31.8 million or 14.3% primarily due to an increase in transactions within our revenue and quality intelligence solutions and due to an increase in payment accuracy solutions as customer contracts were implemented.
our specialized markets revenue increased $0.3 million or 0.3% as a result of modest increase in our supply chain services, offset by a decrease in weather and climate risk solutions.

selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses for our risk assessment segment were $77.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to $80.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2012, a decrease of $3.5 million or 4.4%. the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits of $6.2 million, primarily related to our stock option expense. our stock option expense decreased as a result of lower accelerated vesting of equity awards granted to employees at age 62. there was also a decrease in other general expenses of $0.2 million. these decreases were offset by an increase in professional consulting fees of $2.5 million and travel costs of $0.4 million.
ebitda margin the ebitda margin for our risk assessment segment was 56.1% for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to 54.6% for the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase in margin is primarily attributed to operating leverage in the segment as well as cost efficiencies.
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth our quarterly unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31, 2014. in management's opinion, the quarterly data has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k, and reflects all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation of this data. the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period.
statement of operations data:
operating income                         $148,843             $159,066               $175,490                 $177,047                 $660,446

liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities of $43.2 million and $169.7 million, respectively. subscriptions for our solutions are billed and generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which is usually for one year. subscriptions are automatically renewed at the beginning of each calendar year. we have historically generated significant cash flows from operations. as a result of this factor, as well as the availability of funds under our syndicated revolving credit facility, we believe we will have sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs, and to fuel our future growth plans.
we have historically managed the business with a working capital deficit due to the fact that, as described above, we offer our solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or long-term contracts, which are generally prepaid quarterly or annually in advance of the services being rendered. when cash is received for prepayment of invoices, we record an asset (cash and cash equivalents) on our balance sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability (fees received in advance). this current liability is deferred revenue that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services. in most businesses, growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a company grows. unlike these businesses, our cash position is favorably affected by revenue growth, which results in a source of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services.
our capital expenditures as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, were 8.4% and 9.1%, respectively. we estimate our capital expenditures for 2015 will be approximately $150.0 million, which primarily include expenditures on our technology infrastructure and our continuing investments in developing and enhancing our solutions. expenditures related to developing and enhancing our solutions are predominately related to internal use software and are capitalized in accordance with asc 350-40, "accounting for costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use." we also capitalize amounts in accordance with asc 985-20, "software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed."
we have also historically used a portion of our cash for repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we repurchased $675.4 million (exclusive of $100.0 million of unsettled purchase price associated with the asr program; see note 15 of our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k), $278.9 million and $162.6 million, respectively, of our common stock.
in prior years, we provided pension and postretirement benefits to certain qualifying active employees and retirees. on february 29, 2012, we instituted a hard freeze, which eliminated all future compensation and service credits, to all participants in the pension plans. in april 2012, we completed a voluntary prefunding to our qualified pension plan of $72.0 million, which resulted in a contribution of $78.8 million for the year, of which $28.2 million was the minimum contribution requirement for 2012. as a result of the prefunding, we do not expect to make any contribution in 2015 with respect to our qualified pension plan. under the postretirement plan, we provided certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to qualifying participants; however, participants are required to pay a stated percentage of the premium coverage. we expect to contribute approximately $1.1 million to the postretirement plan in 2015. see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
financing and financing capacity we had total debt, excluding capital lease obligations, of $1,425.8 million and $1,265.1 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the debt at december 31, 2014 was primarily issued under senior notes and long-term private placement loan facilities to finance our stock repurchases and acquisitions.
on april 6, 2011, we completed an issuance of senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $450.0 million. these senior notes are due on may 1, 2021 and accrue interest at a rate of 5.800% per annum. interest is payable semi-annually on may 1st and november 1st of each year.
on december 8, 2011, we completed a second issuance of senior notes in the aggregate principal of $250.0 million. these senior notes are due on january 15, 2019 and accrue interest at a rate of 4.875% per annum. interest is payable semi-annually on january 15th and july 15th of each year.
on september 12, 2012, we completed a third issuance of senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million. these senior notes are due on september 12, 2022 and accrue interest at a rate of 4.125% per annum. interest is payable semi-annually on march 12th and september 12th of each year.
the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by iso and certain subsidiaries that guarantee our syndicated revolving credit facility (credit facility), or any amendment, refinancing or replacement thereof. we expect to redraw from our credit facility over time as needed for our corporate strategy,
including for general corporate purposes, share repurchases, and acquisitions. the indenture governing the senior notes restricts our ability and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, create certain liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate with, sell, lease, convey or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our assets, or merge with or into, any other person or entity.
on october 21, 2014, we amended our committed senior unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks to increase the borrowing capacity under the credit facility from $975.0 million to $990.0 million and extend the maturity date from october 2018 to october 2019. we amortize all one-time fees and third party costs associated with the execution and amendment of this credit facility through the maturity date. interest is payable at a maturity rate of libor plus 1.125% to 1.625%, depending on the result of certain ratios defined in the credit agreement. verisk and iso are co-borrowers under the credit facility. borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchase programs. during the year ended december 31, 2014 , we borrowed $225.0 million under the credit facility and repaid $65.0 million. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had $160.0 million and $0 outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, respectively. in january and february 2015, we repaid a total of $140.0 million of the $160.0 million outstanding borrowings under the credit facility.
as of december 31, 2014, we have an available borrowing capacity, net of outstanding letters of credit, of $827.8 million under the credit facility.
the credit facility contains certain customary financial and other covenants that, among other things, impose certain restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, and capital expenditures. these covenants also place restrictions on mergers, asset sales, sale/leaseback transactions, payments between us and our subsidiaries, and certain transactions with affiliates. the financial covenants require that, at the end of any fiscal quarter, we have a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and that during any period of four fiscal quarters, we maintain a consolidated funded debt leverage ratio below 3.5 to 1.0. we were in compliance with all debt covenants under the credit facility as of december 31, 2014.
we also had long-term private placement loan facilities under uncommitted master shelf agreements with new york life and prudential capital group that expired during 2013. we did not extend these agreements. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had $220.0 million outstanding under these facilities for both periods. the weighted average rate of interest with respect to our outstanding borrowings under these facilities was 6.36% for each of the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 and amounts outstanding was $1.9 million at the end of each period. these notes contain certain covenants that limit our ability to create liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge or sell assets to another company. these notes also contain financial covenants that require that, at the end of any fiscal quarter, we have a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and that we maintain a consolidated funded debt leverage ratio below 3.0 to 1.0 at the end of any fiscal quarter. we were in compliance with all debt covenants under our master shelf agreements as of december 31, 2014.
net cash provided by operating activities             $489,452              $506,920                 $468,229
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $489.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $506.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. net cash provided by operating activities was primarily affected by the sale of our mortgage services business and the timing of excess tax benefits from exercised stock options in the first quarter of 2013.
net cash provided by operating activities increased to $506.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to $468.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash receipts from customers, partially offset by an increase in interest payments related to our bond offerings. in the second quarter of 2012, we pre-funded $72.0 million to our pension plan. this prefunding was partially offset by the tax benefit associated with those deductible contributions and the deferral of our fourth quarter 2012 tax payment to 2013 as a result
of a temporary federal tax relief program related to hurricane sandy. this tax payment would have typically been paid in the fourth quarter of 2012, but due to this relief, the payment was made in the first quarter of 2013.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $35.5 million and $145.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the sale of our mortgage services business for $155.0 million on march 11, 2014, partially offset by the acquisition of maplecroft of $30.1 million.
net cash used in investing activities was $145.6 million and $883.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the fact that we had acquisitions in 2012 with a combined net cash purchase price of $808.3 million versus minor acquisition activity in 2013.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $579.1 million and $284.5 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase of net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 was primarily due to the repurchase of common stock of $778.5 million related to the asr, partially offset by net debt draw downs of $160.0 million.
net cash used in financing activities was $284.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 and net cash provided by financing was $313.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2013 was primarily due to the repurchase of common stock of $277.4 million and debt repayments of $190.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and the related excess tax benefit of $190.3 million.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december 31, 2014 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash:
contractual obligations long-term debt, current portion of long-term debt and interest        $1,605,265            $230,706                       $157,008                        $343,770                      $873,781

(2)   other long-term liabilities consist of our esop contributions and employee-related deferred compensation plan. we also have a deferred compensation plan for our board of directors; however, based on past performance and the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be paid, if any, we have excluded such amounts from the above table.
(3)   unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $10.6 million have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with asc 740, which have been omitted from the table above, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled, with the exception of those amounts subject to a statute of limitation. related to the unrecognized tax benefits, we also have recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $2.8 million.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
critical accounting policies and estimates our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. on an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other post retirement benefits, stock based compensation, and income taxes. actual results may differ from these assumptions or conditions.
revenue recognition the company's revenues are primarily derived from sales of services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and information is delivered to our customers. revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, fees and/or price are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. revenues for subscription services are recognized ratably over the subscription term, usually one year. revenues from transaction-based fees are recognized as information is delivered to customers, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
the company also has term based software licenses where the only remaining undelivered element is post-contract customer support or pcs, including unspecified upgrade rights on a when and if available basis. the company recognizes revenue for these licenses ratably over the duration of the license term. the pcs associated with these arrangements is coterminous with the duration of the license term. the company also provides hosting or software solutions that provide continuous access to information and include pcs and recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of the license term. in addition, the determination of certain of our services revenues requires the use of estimates, principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears. in these instances, we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past. differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported. we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of these services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past.
we invoice our customers in annual, quarterly, or monthly installments. amounts billed and collected in advance are recorded as fees received in advance on the balance sheet and are recognized as the services are performed and revenue recognition criteria are met.
stock based compensation the fair value of equity awards is measured on the date of grant using a black-scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of several estimates, including expected term, expected risk-free interest rate, expected volatility and expected dividend yield.
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the awards granted, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. option grants and restricted stock awards are generally expensed ratably over the four-year vesting period. we follow the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after january 1, 2005, which requires that stock based compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service.
we estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest. the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate.
goodwill and intangibles goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets of the businesses acquired. goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized. intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives. goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as of june 30, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable, using the guidance and criteria described in the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets. this testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value.
as of december 31, 2014, we had goodwill and net intangible assets of $1,613.6 million, which represents 68.8% of our total assets. during 2014, we performed an impairment test as of june 30, 2014 and confirmed that no impairment charge was necessary. there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment testing, including an
estimate of future expected revenues, earnings and cash flows, useful lives and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value. we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining the fair value of our reporting units. to mitigate undue influence, we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other independent parties. the determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units. changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an impairment to be recorded to intangible assets and goodwill. our valuation has not indicated any impairment of our goodwill asset of $1,207.1 million as of december 31, 2014. for the year ended december 31, 2014, there were no impairment indicators related to our intangible assets.
pension and postretirement on february 29, 2012, we instituted a hard freeze, which eliminates all future compensation and service credits, to all participants in the pension plans. see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k. we account for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in accordance with the accounting standard for employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. this standard requires that employers recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their consolidated balance sheets and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit (credit) cost. additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are also derecognized upon adoption of the new standard.
certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual net period benefit (credit) cost and the disclosure of the funded status of these plans. the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets. we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.
in determining the discount rate, we utilize quoted rates from long-term bond indices, and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year, cash flow models and other data sources we consider reasonable based upon the life expectancy and mortality rate of eligible employees. as part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for both the pension and postretirement plans. our separate benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated aa or better at the measurement date. the output from the actuarial models are assessed against the prior year's discount rate and quoted rates for long-term bond indices. for our pension plans at december 31, 2014, we determined this rate to be 3.99%, a decrease of 0.75% from the 4.74% rate used at december 31, 2013. our postretirement rate is 3.00% at december 31, 2014, a decrease of 0.45% from the 3.45% used at december 31, 2013.
the expected return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment returns to a broader long-term forecast adjusted based on our target investment allocation, and the current economic environment. our pension asset investment guidelines target an investment portfolio allocation of 40.00% debt securities and 60.00% equity securities. as of december 31, 2014, the pension plan assets were allocated 41.30% debt, 56.80% equity securities and 1.90% other. the veba plan target allocation is 100% debt. we have used our target investment allocation to derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the projected cash flows of the plan. the expected return for each investment category within our target investment allocation is developed using average historical rates of return for each targeted investment category, considering the projected cash flow of the qualified pension plan and postretirement plan. the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future net periodic benefit (credits) costs. we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31. the future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of the federal medical subsidy. as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010, the tax treatment of federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the corresponding benefits provided under medicare part d was effectively changed. this legislative change reduces future tax benefits of the coverage we provided to participants in the postretirement plan. we are required to account for this change in the period during which the law is enacted.
a one percent change in discount rate and future rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects:
1% decrease                                          1% increase                                           1% decrease                                         1% increase benefit                     projected                benefit                      projected               benefit                     projected               benefit                    projected

income taxes in projecting future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting for uncertainty in income taxes - an interpretation of asc 740, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. under this interpretation, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
we recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.
we estimate unrecognized tax positions of $1.1 million that may be recognized by december 31, 2015, due to expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing authorities, net of additional uncertain tax positions.
as of december 31, 2014, we have gross federal, state, and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $47.3 million, which will expire at various dates from 2015 through 2034. such net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows:
the deferred income tax liability of $197.8 million consists primarily of timing differences involving depreciation and amortization.

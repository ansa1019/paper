2014 financial performance review in 2014, we reported net income of $632.4 million, or $0.72 per common share, relatively unchanged from the prior year. this resulted in a 1.01% return on average assets and a 11.8% return on average tangible common equity. in addition, we grew our base of consumer and business customers as we increased 2014 average earning assets by $6.1 billion, or 12%, over the prior year. our strategic business investments and ocr sales approach continued to generate positive results in 2014. (also, see significant items influencing financial performance comparisons within the discussion of results of operations.)
fully-taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.9 billion in 2014, an increase of $132.7 million, or 8%, compared with 2013. this reflected the impact of 12% earning asset growth, partially offset by 13% interest-bearing liability growth and a 13 basis point decrease in the nim to 3.23%. the earning asset growth reflected a $3.6 billion, or 9%, increase in average loans and leases and a $2.7 billion, or 29%, increase in average securities. the loan growth reflected an increase in average automobile loans, as the growth in originations remained strong. also, average c&i loans increased which primarily reflected growth in trade finance in support of our middle market and corporate customers. the securities growth primarily reflected an increase in lcr level 1 qualified securities and direct purchase municipal instruments. this earnings asset growth was partially offset by a $4.7 billion, or 13%, increase in interest-bearing liabilities. the interest-bearing liability growth reflected a $3.2 billion, or 104%, increase in short- and long-term borrowings
and a $2.2 billion, or 14%, increase in money market deposits, partially offset by a $1.2 billion, or 27%, decrease in average core certificates of deposit. borrowings have been a cost effective method to fund our incremental securities growth and the change in deposit mix reflects our strategic focus on changing funding sources. the nim contraction reflected a 19 basis point decrease related to the mix and yield of earning assets and 3 basis point reduction in the benefit to the margin from the impact of noninterest-bearing funds, partially offset by the 9 basis point reduction in funding costs.
noninterest income was $979.2 million in 2014, a decrease of $33.0 million, or 3%, compared with 2013. mortgage banking income was down due to a reduction in origination and secondary marketing revenue as originations decreased and gain-on-sale margins compressed, and a negative impact from net msr hedging activity. in addition, other income declined primarily due to a decrease in lihtc gains and lower fees associated with commercial loan activity and trust services primarily due to a reduction in fees. these declines were partially offset by an increase in securities gains as we adjusted the mix of our securities portfolio to prepare for the lcr requirements and an increase in electronic banking income due to higher card related income and underlying customer growth.
noninterest expense was $1.9 billion in 2014, an increase of $124.3 million, or 7%, compared with 2013. this reflected an increase in personnel costs, other expense, professional services, outside data processing and other services, and equipment. the increase included $65.5 million of significant items related to franchise repositioning, merger and acquisition costs, and additions to the litigation reserves (this section should be read in conjunction with table 8  noninterest expense). excluding the impact of the significant items, other noninterest expense increased due to state franchise taxes, protective advances, and litigation expense. professional services increased due to outside consultant expenses related to strategic planning and legal services. outside data processing and other services increased, primarily reflecting higher debit and credit card processing costs and increased other technology investment expense, as we continue to invest in technology supporting our products, services, and our continuous improvement initiatives.
credit quality continued to improve in 2014. nals declined $21.8 million, or 7%, from 2013 to $300.2 million, or 0.63% of total loans and leases. npas declined $14.4 million, or 4%, compared to a year-ago to $337.7 million, or 0.71% of total loans and leases, oreo, and other npas. the decreases primarily reflected meaningful improvement in both cre and residential mortgage nals. the provision for credit losses decreased $9.1 million, or 10%, from 2013 due to the continued decline in ncos and nonaccrual loans. ncos decreased $64.0 million, or 34%, from the prior year to $124.6 million. ncos were an annualized 0.27% of average loans and leases in the current year compared to 0.45% in 2013. the acl as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 1.40% from 1.65% a year ago, while the acl as a percentage of period-end total nals increased slightly to 222% from 221%. however, criticized and classified loans did increase $95.1 million, or 7%, from prior year.
the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio at december 31, 2014, was 8.17%, down 65 basis points from a year ago. our tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio at year end was 10.23%, down from 10.90% at the end of 2013. the regulatory tier 1 risk-based capital ratio at december 31, 2014, was 11.50%, down from 12.28% at december 31, 2013. the decreases in the capital ratios were due to balance sheet growth and share repurchases that were partially offset by increased retained earnings and the stock issued in the camco financial acquisition. specifically, all capital ratios were impacted by the repurchase of 35.7 million common shares over the last four quarters, 3.6 million of which were repurchased during the 2014 fourth quarter. this decrease was offset partially by the increase in retained earnings, as well as the issuance of 8.7 million common shares in the camco acquisition. huntington estimates the negative impact to tier 1 common risk-based capital from the 2015 first quarter implementation of the federal reserves revised basel iii capital rules will be approximately 40 basis points on a fully phased-in basis.
business overview general our general business objectives are: (1) grow net interest income and fee income, (2) deliver positive operating leverage, (3) increase primary relationships across all business segments, (4) continue to strengthen risk management and reduce volatility, and (5) maintain strong capital and liquidity positions.
huntington enjoys a unique and advantaged position in the industry and our future is bright. we are focused on executing our strategic plan, and we are very pleased with the results we are achieving. for the past several years we have invested in the company at a time when most of the industry has been pulling back. we have expanded and optimized our retail distribution, both physical and digital. we have invested in small business and commercial specialty lending verticals. we have added new products, such as our consumer and commercial credit cards and our new business and consumer checking accounts. these represent just a handful of the investments we have made. our 2014 earnings reflected results from these investments. yet significant opportunity remains as none of these investments are mature. we have a strong outlook for the future.
economy we remain optimistic on the economy in our footprint as fundamentals look positive. home prices are improving, and the recent reduction in interest rates provides another refinance window. automobile sales were very strong in 2014 and appear poised for another great, if not even better, year in 2015. the state governments in our footprint are operating with surpluses, and most of the municipalities are on solid footing. we have good momentum on the consumer side. our loan pipeline remains stable, and customer activity among our core small and middle market business customer base continues to trend favorably.
legislative and regulatory a comprehensive discussion of legislative and regulatory matters affecting us can be found in the regulatory matters section included in item 1 of this form 10-k.
2015 expectations as we move into 2015, customer activity is strong, pipelines are stable, and our balance sheet is well positioned. we built our plan with an assumption of no change in interest rates and with the flexibility to quickly adjust to the evolving operating environment. we remain committed to investing in the business, disciplined expense control, and delivering full-year positive operating leverage.
excluding significant items and net msr hedging activity, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage in 2015 with revenue growth exceeding noninterest expense growth of 2-4%.
overall, asset quality metrics are expected to remain near current levels, although moderate quarterly volatility also is expected, given the absolute low level of problem assets and credit costs. we anticipate ncos will remain within or below our long-term normalized range of 35 to 55 basis points.
the effective tax rate for 2015 is expected to be in the range of 25% to 28%.

discussion of results of operations this section provides a review of financial performance from a consolidated perspective. it also includes a significant items section that summarizes key issues important for a complete understanding of performance trends. key consolidated balance sheet and income statement trends are discussed. all earnings per share data are reported on a diluted basis. for additional insight on financial performance, please read this section in conjunction with the business segment discussion.
significant items definition of significant items from time-to-time, revenue, expenses, or taxes are impacted by items judged by us to be outside of ordinary banking activities and / or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by us at that time to be infrequent or short-term in nature. we refer to such items as significant items. most often, these significant items result from factors originating outside the company; e.g., regulatory actions / assessments, windfall gains, changes in accounting principles, one-time tax assessments / refunds, litigation actions, etc. in other cases, they may result from our decisions associated with significant corporate actions outside of the ordinary course of business; e.g., merger / restructuring charges, recapitalization actions, goodwill impairment, etc.
even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions, as a general rule volatility alone does not define a significant item. for example, changes in the provision for credit losses, gains / losses from investment activities, asset valuation writedowns, etc., reflect ordinary banking activities and are, therefore, typically excluded from consideration as a significant item.
we believe the disclosure of significant items provides a better understanding of our performance and trends to ascertain which of such items, if any, to include or exclude from an analysis of our performance; i.e., within the context of determining how that performance differed from expectations, as well as how, if at all, to adjust estimates of future performance accordingly. to this end, we adopted a practice of listing significant items in our external disclosure documents; e.g., earnings press releases, investor presentations, forms 10-q and 10-k.
significant items for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance.
significant items influencing financial performance comparisons earnings comparisons among the three years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 were impacted by a number of significant items summarized below.
1.    franchise repositioning related expense. significant events relating to franchise repositioning related expense, and the impacts of those events on our reported results, were as follows:
   during 2014, $28.0 million of franchise repositioning related expense was recorded for the consolidation of 26 branches and organizational actions.
this resulted in a negative impact of $0.02 per common share in 2014.
   during 2013, $23.5 million of franchise repositioning related expense was recorded. this resulted in a negative impact of $0.02 per common share in
2.    litigation reserve. $20.9 million and $23.5 million of net additions to litigation reserves were recorded as other noninterest expense in 2014 and 2012, respectively. this resulted in a negative impact of $0.02 per common share in 2014 and 2012.
3.    mergers and acquisitions. during 2014, $15.8 million of net noninterest expense was recorded related to the acquisition of 24 bank of america branches and camco financial. this resulted in a negative impact of $0.01 per common share in 2014.
4.    pension curtailment gain. during 2013, a $33.9 million pension curtailment gain was recorded in personnel costs. this resulted in a positive impact of $0.03 per common share in 2013.
5.                                                  state deferred tax asset valuation allowance adjustment. during 2012, a valuation allowance of $21.3 million (net of tax) was released for the portion of the deferred tax asset and state net operating loss carryforwards expected to be realized. this resulted in a positive impact of $0.02 per common share in 2012. additional information can be found in the provision for income taxes section within this md&amp;a.
6.    bargain purchase gain. during 2012, an $11.2 million bargain purchase gain associated with the fdic-assisted fidelity bank acquisition was recorded in noninterest income. this resulted in a positive impact of $0.01 per common share in 2012.
the following table reflects the earnings impact of the above-mentioned significant items for periods affected by this results of operations discussion:

net interest income / average balance sheet our primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from earning assets (primarily loans, securities, and direct financing leases), and interest expense of funding sources (primarily interest-bearing deposits and borrowings). earning asset balances and related funding sources, as well as changes in the levels of interest rates, impact net interest income. the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities is the net interest spread. noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and shareholders equity, also support earning assets. the impact of the noninterest-bearing sources of funds, often referred to as free funds, is captured in the net interest margin, which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets. both the net interest margin and net interest spread are presented on a fully-taxable equivalent basis, which means that tax-free interest income has been adjusted to a pretax equivalent income, assuming a 35% tax rate.
the following table shows changes in fully-taxable equivalent interest income, interest expense, and net interest income due to volume and rate variances for major categories of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities:

(2)   for purposes of this analysis, nonaccrual loans are reflected in the average balances of loans.
fully-taxable equivalent net interest income for 2014 increased $132.7 million, or 8%, from 2013. this reflected the impact of 12% earning asset growth, partially offset by 13% interest-bearing liability growth and a 13 basis point decrease in the nim to 3.23%.
   $2.7 billion, or 29%, increase in average securities, reflecting an increase of liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) level 1 qualified securities and direct purchase municipal instruments.
   $1.2 billion, or 7%, increase in average c&amp;i loans and leases, primarily reflecting growth in trade finance in support of our middle market and corporate customers.
   $0.4 billion, or 8%, increase in average residential mortgage loans as a result of the camco financial acquisition and a decrease in the rate of payoffs due to lower levels of refinancing.
   $3.2 billion, or 104%, increase in short- and long-term borrowings, which are a cost effective method of funding incremental securities growth.
   $2.2 billion, or 14%, increase in money market deposits, reflecting the strategic focus on customer growth and increased share-of-wallet among both consumer and commercial customers.
   $0.5 billion, or 33%, increase in brokered deposits and negotiated cds, which were used to efficiently finance balance sheet growth while continuing to manage the overall cost of funds.
partially offset by:
   $1.2 billion, or 27%, decrease in average core certificates of deposit due to the strategic focus on changing the funding sources to no-cost demand deposits and lower-cost money market deposits.
the primary items impacting the decrease in the nim were:
   19 basis point negative impact from the mix and yield on earning assets, primarily reflecting lower rates on loans, and the impact of an increased total securities balance.
   3 basis point decrease in the benefit to the margin of non-interest bearing funds, reflecting lower interest rates on total interest bearing liabilities from the prior year.
partially offset by:
   9 basis point positive impact from the mix and yield of total interest-bearing liabilities, reflecting the strategic focus on changing the funding sources from higher rate time deposits to no-cost demand deposits and low-cost money market deposits.
fully-taxable equivalent net interest income for 2013 increased $1.0 million, or less than 1%, from 2012. this reflected the impact of 4% loan growth, a 5 basis point decrease in the nim to 3.36%, as well as a 7% reduction in other earning assets, the majority of which were loans held for sale. the primary items impacting the decrease in the nim were:
   19 basis point negative impact from the mix and yield of earning assets primarily reflecting a decrease in consumer loan yields.
   3 basis point decrease in the benefit to the margin of non-interest bearing funds, reflecting lower interest rates on total interest bearing liabilities from the prior year.
partially offset by:
   14 basis point positive impact from the mix and yield of deposits reflecting the strategic focus on changing the funding sources from higher rate time deposits to no-cost demand deposits and low-cost money market deposits.
   3 basis point positive impact from noncore funding primarily reflecting lower debt costs.
   $1.2 billion, or 8%, increase in average c&amp;i loans and leases. this reflected the continued growth within the middle market healthcare vertical, equipment finance, and dealer floorplan.
   $1.2 billion, or 25%, increase in average on balance sheet automobile loans, as the growth in originations remained strong and our investments in the northeast and upper midwest continued to grow as planned.
partially offset by:
   $0.8 billion, or 13%, decrease in average cre loans, as acceptable returns for new originations were balanced against internal concentration limits and increased competition for projects sponsored by high quality developers.
   $0.6 billion, or 52%, decrease in loans held-for-sale reflecting the impact of automobile loan securitizations completed in 2012.
while there was minimal impact on the full-year average balance sheet, $1.9 billion of net investment securities were purchased during the 2013 fourth quarter. our investment securities portfolio is evaluated under established asset/liability management objectives. additionally, $0.6 billion of direct purchase municipal instruments were reclassified on december 31, 2013, from c&i loans to available-for-sale securities.
   $1.7 billion, or 27%, decrease in average core certificates of deposit due to the strategic focus on changing the funding sources to no-cost demand deposits and low-cost money market deposits.
   $0.6 billion, or 47%, decrease in short-term borrowings due to a focused effort to reduce collateralized deposits.
partially offset by:
   $1.8 billion, or 13%, increase in money market deposits reflecting the strategic focus on customer growth and increased share of wallet among both consumer and commercial customers.
while there was minimal impact on the full-year average balance sheet, average subordinated notes and other long-term debt reflect the issuance of $0.5 billion and $0.8 billion of long-term debt in the 2013 fourth quarter and the 2013 third quarter, respectively.

the provision for credit losses is the expense necessary to maintain the alll and the aulc at levels appropriate to absorb our estimate of credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded loan commitments and letters-of-credit.

      $42.0 million, or 33%, decrease in mortgage banking income primarily driven by a $27.7 million, or 33%, reduction in origination and secondary marketing revenue as originations decreased and gain-on-sale margins compressed, and a $14.2 million negative impact from net msr hedging activity.
   $7.0 million, or 6%, decrease in trust services primarily due to a reduction in fees.
partially offset by:
   $17.1 million increase in securities gains as we adjusted the mix of our securities portfolio to prepare for the lcr requirements.
   $12.8 million, or 14%, increase in electronic banking income due to higher card related income and underlying customer growth.
   $64.2 million, or 34%, decrease in mortgage banking income primarily driven by 9% reduction in volume, lower gain on sale margin, and a higher percentage of originations held on the balance sheet.
   $40.0 million, or 69%, decrease in gain on sale of loans as no auto loan securitizations occurred in 2013 compared to $2.3 billion of auto loan securitizations in 2012.
partially offset by:
   $10.3 million, or 13%, increase in electronic banking income due to continued consumer household growth.
                              $9.6 million, or 4%, increase in service charges on deposit accounts reflecting 8% consumer household and 6% commercial relationship growth and changing customer usage patterns. this more than offset the approximately $28.0 million negative impact of the february 2013 implementation of a new posting order for consumer transaction accounts.
                                                $1.1 million, or 1%, increase in other income. in accordance with asc 323-740, the low income housing tax credit investment amortization expense is now presented as a component of provision for income taxes. previously, the amortization expense was included in other income. this change resulted in higher other income. in addition, there was an increase in fees associated with commercial loan activity. these increases were partially offset by an $11.2 million bargain purchase gain associated with the fdic-assisted fidelity bank acquisition in the prior year.

the provision for income taxes was $220.6 million for 2014 compared with a provision for income taxes of $227.5 million in 2013. both years included the benefits from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, general business credits, and the change in accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects. in 2014, a $26.9 million reduction in the 2014 provision for federal income taxes was recorded for the portion of federal deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards that are more likely than not
to be realized compared to a $93.3 million increase in 2013. in 2014, a $7.4 million reduction in the 2014 provision for state income taxes, net of federal, was recorded for the portion of state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards that are more likely than not to be realized, compared to a $6.0 million reduction in 2013. at december 31, 2014, we had a net federal deferred tax asset of $72.1 million and a net state deferred tax asset of $45.3 million. for regulatory capital purposes, there was no disallowed net deferred tax asset at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013.
we file income tax returns with the irs and various state, city, and foreign jurisdictions. federal income tax audits have been completed for tax years through 2009. in the first quarter of 2013, the irs began an examination of our 2010 and 2011 consolidated federal income tax returns. certain proposed adjustments resulting from the irs examination of our 2005 through 2009 tax returns have been settled with the irs appeals office, subject to final approval by the joint committee on taxation of the u.s. congress. various state and other jurisdictions remain open to examination, including ohio, kentucky, indiana, michigan, pennsylvania, west virginia and illinois.
the provision for income taxes was $227.5 million for 2013 compared with a provision for income taxes of $202.3 million in 2012. both years included the benefits from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, general business credits, and the change in accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects. in 2013, a $93.3 million increase in the 2013 provision for federal income taxes was recorded for the portion of federal capital loss carryforward deferred tax asset that are more likely than not to be realized compared to $3.0 million in 2012. in 2013, a $6.0 million reduction in the 2013 provision for state income taxes, net of federal, was recorded for the portion of state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards that are more likely than not to be realized, compared to a $21.3 million reduction in 2012.
risk management and capital a comprehensive discussion of risk management and capital matters affecting us can be found in the risk governance section included in item 1a and the regulatory matters section of item 1 of this form 10-k.
some of the more significant processes used to manage and control credit, market, liquidity, operational, and compliance risks are described in the following paragraphs.
credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation. the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities, as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending. we also have credit risk associated with our afs and htm securities portfolios (see note 4 and note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements). we engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing, asset and liability management, mortgage banking, and trading activities. while there is credit risk associated with derivative activity, we believe this exposure is minimal.
we continue to focus on the identification, monitoring, and managing of our credit risk. in addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes, market risk management activities, and portfolio diversification, we use additional quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources, enhanced use of modeling technology, and internal stress testing processes. our portfolio management resources demonstrate our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile. in our efforts to continue to identify risk mitigation techniques, we have focused on product design features, origination policies, and treatment strategies for delinquent or stressed borrowers.
the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers. all authority to grant commitments is delegated through the independent credit administration function and is closely monitored and regularly updated. concentration risk is managed through limits on loan type, geography, industry, and loan quality factors. we focus predominantly on extending credit to retail and commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary banking markets, although we will consider lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives. although we offer a broad set of products, we continue to develop new lending products and opportunities. each of these new products and opportunities goes through a rigorous development and approval process prior to implementation to ensure our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low risk portfolio profile.
the checks and balances in the credit process and the separation of the credit administration and risk management functions are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted, facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur, and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution. for example, we do not extend additional credit to delinquent borrowers except in certain circumstances that substantially improve our overall repayment or collateral coverage position.
our asset quality indicators reflected continued overall improvement of our credit quality performance in 2014.
loan and lease credit exposure mix at december 31, 2014, our loans and leases totaled $47.7 billion, representing a $4.6 billion, or 11%, increase compared to $43.1 billion at december 31, 2013. the majority of the portfolio growth occurred in the automobile and c&i portfolios. huntington remained committed to a high quality origination strategy. the cre portfolio remained relatively consistent, as a result of continued runoff offset by new production within the requirements associated with achieving an acceptable return, our internal concentration limits and increased competition for projects sponsored by high quality developers.
total commercial loans and leases were $24.2 billion at december 31, 2014, and represented 51% of our total loan and lease credit exposure. our commercial loan portfolio is diversified along product type, customer size, and geography within our footprint, and is comprised of the following (see commercial credit discussion):
c&i  c&i loans and leases are made to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases, or other projects. the majority of these borrowers are customers doing business within our geographic regions. c&i loans and leases are generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets of the company and/or the personal guarantee of the business owners. the financing of owner occupied facilities is considered a c&i loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral. this treatment is a result of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt. the operation, sale, rental, or refinancing of the real estate is not considered the primary repayment source for these types of loans. as we have expanded our c&i portfolio, we have developed a series of vertical specialties to ensure that new products or lending types are embedded within a structured, centralized commercial lending area with designated experienced credit officers. these specialties are comprised of either targeted industries (for example, healthcare, food & agribusiness, energy, etc) and/or lending disciplines (equipment finance, abl, etc), all of which requires a high degree of expertise and oversight to effectively mitigate and monitor risk. as such, we have dedicated colleagues and teams focused on bringing value added expertise to these specialty clients.
cre  cre loans consist of loans to developers and reits supporting income-producing or for-sale commercial real estate properties. we mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with projected cash flow in excess of the debt service requirement. these loans are made to finance properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers, and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale, or refinance of the property.
construction cre  construction cre loans are loans to developers, companies, or individuals used for the construction of a commercial or residential property for which repayment will be generated by the sale or permanent financing of the property. our construction cre portfolio primarily consists of retail, multi family, office, and warehouse project types. generally, these loans are for construction projects that have been presold or preleased, or have secured permanent financing, as well as loans to real estate companies with significant equity invested in each project. these loans are underwritten and managed by a specialized real estate lending group that actively monitors the construction phase and manages the loan disbursements according to the predetermined construction schedule.
total consumer loans and leases were $23.4 billion at december 31, 2014, and represented 49% of our total loan and lease credit exposure. the consumer portfolio is comprised primarily of automobile, home equity loans and lines-of-credit, and residential mortgages (see consumer credit discussion). the increase from december 31, 2013 primarily relates to strong consumer demand for automobile originations and adjustable rate residential mortgages (arms).
automobile  automobile loans are comprised primarily of loans made through automotive dealerships and include exposure in selected states outside of our primary banking markets. the exposure outside of our primary banking markets represents 19% of the total exposure, with no individual state representing more than 6%. applications are underwritten utilizing an automated underwriting system that applies consistent policies and processes across the portfolio.
home equity  home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines-of-credit. this type of lending, which is secured by a first-lien or junior-lien on the borrowers residence, allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home or refinance existing mortgage debt. products include closed-end loans which are generally fixed-rate with principal and interest payments, and variable-rate, interest-only lines-of-credit which do not require payment of principal during the 10-year revolving period. the home equity line of credit may convert to a 20-year amortizing structure at the end of the revolving period. applications are underwritten centrally in conjunction with an automated underwriting system. the home equity underwriting criteria is based on minimum credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, and ltv ratios, with current collateral valuations.
residential mortgage  residential mortgage loans represent loans to consumers for the purchase or refinance of a residence. these loans are generally financed over a 15-year to 30-year term, and in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. applications are underwritten centrally using consistent credit policies and processes. all residential mortgage loan decisions utilize a full appraisal for collateral valuation. huntington has not originated or acquired residential mortgages that allow negative amortization or allow the borrower multiple payment options.
other consumer  primarily consists of consumer loans not secured by real estate, including personal unsecured loans, overdraft balances, and credit cards. we introduced a consumer credit card product during 2013, utilizing a centralized underwriting system and focusing on existing huntington customers.
the table below provides the composition of our total loan and lease portfolio:
(1)   as defined by regulatory guidance, there were no commercial loans outstanding that would be considered a concentration of lending to a particular industry or group of industries.
(2)                        2011 included a decrease of $1.3 billion resulting from the transfer of automobile loans to loans held for a sale reflecting an automobile securitization transaction completed in 2012. 2010 included an increase of $0.5 billion resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard to consolidate a previously off-balance sheet automobile loan securitization transaction.
as shown in the table above, our loan portfolio is diversified by consumer and commercial credit. at the corporate level, we manage the credit exposure in part via a credit concentration policy. the policy designates specific loan types, collateral types, and loan structures to be formally tracked and assigned limits as a percentage of capital. c&i lending by naics categories, specific limits for cre primary project types, loans secured by residential real estate, shared national credit exposure, and designated high risk loan definitions represent examples of specifically tracked components of our concentration management process. currently there are no identified concentrations that exceed the established limit. our concentration management process is approved by our board level risk oversight committee and is one of the strategies utilized to ensure a high quality, well diversified portfolio that is consistent with our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile.
the table below provides our total loan and lease portfolio segregated by the type of collateral securing the loan or lease. the changes in the collateral composition are consistent with the portfolio growth metrics, with increases noted in the residential and vehicle categories. the increase in the unsecured exposure is centered in high quality commercial credit customers.
table 10loan and lease portfolio by collateral type at december 31,
commercial credit the primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower, assessment of the borrowers management capabilities, cash flows from operations, industry sector trends, type and sufficiency of collateral, type of exposure, transaction structure, and the general economic outlook. while these are the primary factors considered, there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process. we utilize a centralized preview and senior loan approval committee, led by our chief credit officer. the risk rating (see next paragraph) and complexity of the credit determines the threshold for approval of the senior loan committee with a minimum credit exposure of $10.0 million. for loans not requiring senior loan committee approval, with the exception of small business loans, credit officers who understand each local region and are experienced in the industries and loan structures of the requested credit exposure are involved in all loan decisions and have the primary credit authority. for small business loans, we utilize a centralized loan approval process for standard products and structures. in this centralized decision environment, certain individuals who understand each local region may make credit-extension decisions to preserve our commitment to the communities we operate in. in addition to disciplined and consistent judgmental factors, a sophisticated credit scoring process is used as a primary evaluation tool in the determination of approving a loan within the centralized loan approval process.
in commercial lending, on-going credit management is dependent on the type and nature of the loan. we monitor all significant exposures on an on-going basis. all commercial credit extensions are assigned internal risk ratings reflecting the borrowers pd and lgd. this two-dimensional rating methodology provides granularity in the portfolio management process. the pd is rated and applied at the borrower level. the lgd is rated and applied based on the specific type of credit extension and the quality and lien position associated with the underlying collateral. the internal risk ratings are assessed at origination and updated at each periodic monitoring event. there is also extensive macro portfolio management analysis on an on-going basis. we continually review and adjust our risk-rating criteria based on actual experience, which provides us with the current risk level in the portfolio and is the basis for determining an appropriate allowance for credit losses (acl) amount for the commercial portfolio. a centralized portfolio management team monitors and reports on the performance of the entire commercial portfolio, including small business loans, to provide consistent oversight.
in addition to the initial credit analysis conducted during the approval process, our credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality and risk of new loan originations. this group is part of our risk management area, and conducts portfolio reviews on a risk-based cycle to evaluate individual loans, validate risk ratings, as well as test the consistency of credit processes.
our standardized loan grading system considers many components that directly correlate to loan quality and likelihood of repayment, one of which is guarantor support. on an annual basis, or more frequently if warranted, we consider, among other things, the guarantors reputation and creditworthiness, along with various key financial metrics such as liquidity and net worth, assuming such information is available. our assessment of the guarantors credit strength, or lack thereof, is reflected in our risk ratings for such loans, which is directly tied to, and an integral component of, our acl methodology. when a loan goes to impaired status, viable guarantor support is considered in the determination of a credit loss.
if our assessment of the guarantors credit strength yields an inherent capacity to perform, we will seek repayment from the guarantor as part of the collection process and have done so successfully. however, we do not formally track the repayment success from guarantors.
substantially all loans categorized as classified (see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements) are managed by our special assets department (sad). the sad group is a specialized group of credit professionals that handle the day-to-day management of workouts, commercial recoveries, and problem loan sales. its responsibilities include developing and implementing action plans, assessing risk ratings, and determining the appropriateness of the allowance, the accrual status, and the ultimate collectability of the classified loan portfolio.
c&i portfolio the c&i portfolio is comprised of loans to businesses where the source of repayment is associated with the on-going operations of the business. generally, the loans are secured by the borrowers assets, such as equipment, accounts receivable, and/or inventory. in many cases, the loans are secured by real estate, although the operation, sale, or refinancing of the real estate is not a primary source of repayment for the loan. for loans secured by real estate, appropriate appraisals are obtained at origination and updated on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirements.
currently, higher-risk segments of the c&i portfolio include loans to borrowers supporting the home building industry, contractors, and leveraged lending. we manage the risks inherent in this portfolio through origination policies, a defined loan concentration policy with established limits, on-going loan level reviews and portfolio level reviews, recourse requirements, and continuous portfolio risk management activities. our origination policies for this portfolio include loan product-type specific policies such as ltv and debt service coverage ratios, as applicable.
the c&i portfolio continues to have strong origination activity as evidenced by the growth over the past 12 months. the credit quality of the portfolio remains strong as we maintain a focus on high quality originations. problem loans have trended downward over the last several years, reflecting a combination of proactive risk identification and effective workout strategies implemented by the sad. we continue to maintain a proactive approach to identifying borrowers that may be facing financial difficulty in order to maximize the potential solutions.
cre portfolio we manage the risks inherent in this portfolio specific to cre lending, focusing on the quality of the developer and the specifics associated with each project. generally, we: (1) limit our loans to 80% of the appraised value of the commercial real estate at origination, (2) require net operating cash flows to be 125% of required interest and principal payments, and (3) if the commercial real estate is nonowner occupied, require that at least 50% of the space of the project be preleased. we actively monitor both geographic and project-type concentrations and performance metrics of all cre loan types, with a focus on loans identified as higher risk based on the risk rating methodology. both macro-level and loan-level stress-test scenarios based on existing and forecast market conditions are part of the on-going portfolio management process for the cre portfolio.
dedicated real estate professionals originate and manage the majority of the portfolio, with the remainder obtained from prior bank acquisitions. the portfolio is diversified by project type and loan size, and this diversification represents a significant portion of the credit risk management strategies employed for this portfolio. subsequent to the origination of the loan, the credit review group provides an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and risk of new loan originations.
appraisal values are obtained in conjunction with all originations and renewals, and on an as needed basis, in compliance with regulatory requirements. appraisals are obtained from approved vendors, and are reviewed by an internal appraisal review group comprised of certified appraisers to ensure the quality of the valuation used in the underwriting process. we continue to perform on-going portfolio level reviews within the cre portfolio. these reviews generate action plans based on occupancy levels or sales volume associated with the projects being reviewed. property values are updated using appraisals on a regular basis to ensure appropriate decisions regarding the on-going management of the portfolio reflect the changing market conditions. this highly individualized process requires working closely with all of our borrowers, as well as an in-depth knowledge of cre project lending and the market environment.
consumer credit consumer credit approvals are based on, among other factors, the financial strength and payment history of the borrower, type of exposure, and the transaction structure. consumer credit decisions are generally made in a centralized environment utilizing decision models. importantly, certain individuals who understand each local region have the authority to make credit extension decisions to preserve our focus on the local communities we operate in. each credit extension is assigned a specific pd and lgd. the pd is generally based on the borrowers most recent credit bureau score (fico), which we update quarterly, while the lgd is related to the type of collateral and the ltv ratio associated with the credit extension.
in consumer lending, credit risk is managed from a segment (i.e., loan type, collateral position, geography, etc.) and vintage performance analysis. all portfolio segments are continuously monitored for changes in delinquency trends and other asset quality indicators. we make extensive use of portfolio assessment models to continuously monitor the quality of the portfolio, which may result in changes to future origination strategies. the on-going analysis and review process results in a determination of an appropriate alll amount for our consumer loan portfolio. the independent risk management group has a consumer process review component to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the consumer credit processes.
collection action is initiated as needed through a centrally managed collection and recovery function. the collection group employs a series of collection methodologies designed to maintain a high level of effectiveness while maximizing efficiency. in addition to the consumer loan portfolio, the collection group is responsible for collection activity on all sold and securitized consumer loans and leases. collection practices include a single contact point for the majority of the residential real estate secured portfolios.
automobile portfolio our strategy in the automobile portfolio continues to focus on high quality borrowers as measured by both fico and internal custom scores, combined with appropriate ltvs, terms, and profitability. our strategy and operational capabilities allow us to appropriately manage the origination quality across the entire portfolio, including our newer markets. although increased origination volume and entering new markets can be associated with increased risk levels, we believe our disciplined strategy and operational processes significantly mitigate these risks.
we have continued to consistently execute our value proposition and take advantage of available market opportunities. importantly, we have maintained our high credit quality standards while expanding the portfolio.
residential real estate secured portfolios the properties securing our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are primarily located within our geographic footprint. huntington continues to support our local markets with consistent underwriting across all residential secured products. the residential-secured portfolio originations continue to be of high quality, with the majority of the negative credit impact coming from loans originated in 2006 and earlier. our portfolio management strategies associated with our home savers group allow us to focus on effectively helping our customers with appropriate solutions for their specific circumstances.
(1)   the ltv ratios for home equity loans and home equity lines-of-credit are cumulative and reflect the balance of any senior loans. ltv ratios reflect collateral values at the time of loan origination.
(2)   portfolio weighted average fico scores reflect currently updated customer credit scores whereas origination weighted average fico scores reflect the customer credit scores at the time of loan origination.
home equity portfolio our home equity portfolio (loans and lines-of-credit) consists of both first-lien and junior-lien mortgage loans with underwriting criteria based on minimum credit scores, debt-to-income ratios, and ltv ratios. we offer closed-end home equity loans which are generally fixed-rate with principal and interest payments, and variable-rate interest-only home equity lines-of-credit which do not require payment of principal during the 10-year revolving period of the line-of-credit. applications are underwritten centrally in conjunction with an automated underwriting system.
given the low interest rate environment over the past several years, many borrowers have utilized the line-of-credit home equity product as the primary source of financing their home versus residential mortgages. the proportion of the home equity portfolio secured by a first-lien has increased significantly over the past three years, positively impacting the portfolios risk profile. at december 31, 2014, $5.1 billion or 60% of our total home equity portfolio was secured by first-lien mortgages compared to 58% in the prior year. the first-lien position, combined with continued high average fico scores and high ltv, significantly reduces the credit risk associated with these loans.
within the home equity portfolio, the standard product is a 10-year interest-only draw period with a 20-year fully amortizing term at the end of the draw period. prior to 2007, the standard product was a 10-year draw period with a balloon payment. in either case, after the 10-year draw period, the borrower must reapply, subject to full underwriting guidelines, to continue with the interest only revolving structure or begin repaying the debt in a term structure.
the principal and interest payment associated with the term structure will be higher than the interest-only payment, resulting in maturity risk. our maturity risk can be segregated into two distinct segments: (1) home equity lines-of-credit underwritten with a balloon payment at maturity and (2) home equity lines-of-credit with an automatic conversion to a 20-year amortizing loan. we manage this risk based on both the actual maturity date of the line-of-credit structure and at the end of the 10-year draw period. this maturity risk is embedded in the portfolio which we address with proactive contact strategies beginning one year prior to maturity. in certain circumstances, our home saver group is able to provide payment and structure relief to borrowers experiencing significant financial hardship associated with the payment adjustment. our existing heloc maturity strategy is consistent with the recent regulatory guidance.
the table below summarizes our home equity line-of-credit portfolio by the actual maturity date as described above.
table 12maturity schedule of home equity line-of-credit portfolio december 31, 2014
total home equity line-of-credit                $229                    $123                    $105                     $19               $5,391              $5,867
total home equity line-of-credit                $281                    $245                    $130                    $112               $4,684              $5,452
the reduction in maturities presented in over 1-year categories is a result of our change to a product with a 20-year amortization period after 10-year draw period structure. loans with a balloon payment structure risk is essentially eliminated after 2015.
the amounts in the above table maturing in four years or less primarily consist of balloon payment structures and represent the most significant maturity risk. the amounts maturing in more than four years primarily consist of exposure with a 20-year amortization period after the 10-year draw period.
historically, less than 30% of our home equity lines-of-credit that are one year or less from maturity actually reach the maturity date.
residential mortgages portfolio huntington underwrites all applications centrally, with a focus on higher quality borrowers. we do not originate residential mortgages that allow negative amortization or allow the borrower multiple payment options and have incorporated regulatory requirements and guidance into our underwriting process. all residential mortgages are originated based on a completed full appraisal during the credit underwriting process. we update values in compliance with applicable regulations to facilitate our portfolio management, as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions.
several government programs continued to impact the residential mortgage portfolio, including various refinance programs such as hamp and harp, which positively affected the availability of credit for the industry. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we closed $248.0 million in harp residential mortgages and $1.8 million in hamp residential mortgages. the harp and hamp residential mortgage loans are part of our residential mortgage portfolio or serviced for others.
we are subject to repurchase risk associated with residential mortgage loans sold in the secondary market. an appropriate level of reserve for representations and warranties related to residential mortgage loans sold has been established to address this repurchase risk inherent in the portfolio (see operational risk discussion).
(this section should be read in conjunction with note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.)
we believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance is through an analysis of credit quality performance ratios. this approach forms the basis of most of the discussion in the sections immediately following: npas and nals, tdrs, acl, and ncos. in addition, we utilize delinquency rates, risk distribution and migration patterns, and product segmentation in the analysis of our credit quality performance.
credit quality performance in 2014 reflected continued overall improvement. npas declined 4% to $337.7 million, compared to december 31, 2013, as the cre, automobile and residential portfolio segments showed declines. this was partially offset by increases in c&i, primarily due to two credit relationships, and home equity as a result of lower partial charge-offs due the housing market recovery from the lows in 2010-2011. ncos decreased 34% compared to the prior year, as a result of declines in the cre, home equity and residential portfolios. total criticized loans continued to decline, across both the commercial and consumer segments on a percentage basis. as a result of the continued credit quality improvement, the acl to total loans ratio declined by 25 basis points to 1.40%.
(this section should be read in conjunction with note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.)
npas and nals npas consist of (1) nals, which represent loans and leases no longer accruing interest, (2) oreo properties, and (3) other npas. any loan in our portfolio may be placed on nonaccrual status prior to the policies described below when collection of principal or interest is in doubt. also, when a borrower with discharged non-reaffirmed debt in a chapter 7 bankruptcy is identified and the loan is determined to be collateral dependent, the loan is placed on nonaccrual status.
c&i and cre loans (except for purchased credit impaired loans) are placed on nonaccrual status at 90-days past due, or earlier if repayment of principal and interest is in doubt. of the $120.5 million of cre and c&i-related nals at december 31, 2014, $65.7 million, or 54%, represented loans that were less than 30-days past due, demonstrating our continued commitment to proactive credit risk management. with the exception of residential mortgage loans guaranteed by government organizations which continue to accrue interest, first lien loans secured by residential mortgage collateral are placed on nonaccrual status at 150-days past due. junior-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at the earlier of 120-days past due or when the related first-lien loan has been identified as nonaccrual. automobile and other consumer loans are generally charged-off prior to the loan reaching 120-days past due.
when loans are placed on nonaccrual, accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged to interest income and prior year amounts generally charged-off as a credit loss. when, in our judgment, the borrowers ability to make required interest and principal payments has resumed and collectability is no longer in doubt, the loan or lease could be returned to accrual status.
the table reflects period-end nals and npas detail for each of the last five years:
nonaccrual loans as a % of total loans and leases           0.63   %           0.75   %            1.00   %            1.39   %          2.04   %
allowance for loan and lease losses as % of:
allowance for credit losses as % of:
(2)   this ratio is calculated as nonperforming assets divided by the sum of loans and leases, impaired loans held for sale, net other real estate owned, and other nonperforming assets.
   $24.9 million, or 34%, decline in cre nals, reflecting both nco activity and problem credit resolutions, including borrower payments and payoffs partially resulting from successful workout strategies implemented by our sad group.
   $23.0 million, or 19%, decline in residential mortgage nals, reflecting resolution of foreclosure processes and improved delinquency trends.
partially offset by:
   $7.4 million, or 27%, increase in net oreo properties primarily related to consumer oreo, reflecting the impact from the acquisition of camco financial.
as discussed previously, residential mortgages are placed on nonaccrual status at 150-days past due, with the exception of residential mortgages guaranteed by government organizations which continue to accrue interest. first-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 150-days past due. junior-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at the earlier of 120-days past due or when the related first-lien loan has been identified as nonaccrual.
the following table reflects period-end accruing loans and leases 90 days or more past due for each of the last five years:
excluding loans guaranteed by the u.s. government, as a percent of total loans and leases      0.16   %      0.18   %      0.27   %      0.19   %      0.23   %
guaranteed by the u.s. government, as a percent of total loans and leases                      0.12          0.20          0.22          0.25          0.26
including loans guaranteed by the u.s. government, as a percent of total loans and leases      0.27          0.38          0.49          0.44          0.49
(1)   amounts represent accruing purchased impaired loans related to the fdic-assisted fidelity bank and camco financial acquisition. under the applicable accounting guidance (asc 310-30), the loans were recorded at fair value upon acquisition and remain in accruing status.
(this section should be read in conjunction with note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.)
tdrs are modified loans where a concession was provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. tdrs can be classified as either accrual or nonaccrual loans. nonaccrual tdrs are included in nals whereas accruing tdrs are excluded from nals, as it is probable that all contractual principal and interest due under the restructured terms will be collected. tdrs primarily reflect our loss mitigation efforts to proactively work with borrowers in financial difficulty.
the table below presents our accruing and nonaccruing tdrs at period-end for each of the past five years:
our strategy is to structure tdrs in a manner that avoids new concessions subsequent to the initial tdr terms. however, there are times when subsequent modifications are required, such as when the modified loan matures. often the loans are performing in accordance with the tdr terms, and a new note is originated with similar modified terms. these loans are subjected to the normal underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions, both new and existing. if the loan is not performing in accordance with the existing tdr terms, typically an individualized approach to repayment is established. in accordance with asc 310-20-35, the refinanced note is evaluated to determine if it is considered a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan. a new loan is considered for removal of the tdr designation. a continuation of the prior note requires the continuation of the tdr designation, and because the refinanced note constitutes a new or amended debt instrument, it is included in our tdr activity table (below) as a new tdr and a restructured tdr removal during the period.
the types of concessions granted are consistent with those granted on new tdrs and include interest rate reductions, amortization or maturity date changes beyond what the collateral supports, and principal forgiveness based on the borrowers specific needs at a point in time. our policy does not limit the number of times a loan may be modified. a loan may be modified multiple times if it is considered to be in the best interest of both the borrower and huntington.
commercial loans are not automatically considered to be accruing tdrs upon the granting of a new concession. if the loan is in accruing status and no loss is expected based on the modified terms, the modified tdr remains in accruing status. for loans that are on nonaccrual status before the modification, collection of both principal and interest must not be in doubt, and the borrower must be able to exhibit sufficient cash flows for a six-month period of time to service the debt in order to return to accruing status. this six-month period could extend before or after the restructure date.
tdrs in the home equity and residential mortgage portfolio may continue to increase in the near term as we continue to appropriately manage the portfolio and work with our borrowers. any granted change in terms or conditions that are not readily available in the market for that borrower, requires the designation as a tdr. there are no provisions for the removal of the tdr designation based on payment activity for consumer loans.
the following table reflects tdr activity for each of the past four years:
tdrs, beginning of period                     $954,841                  $875,625                  $805,650                  $666,880
charge-offs                                    (35,150   )               (29,897   )               (81,115   )               (37,341   )

our total credit reserve is comprised of two different components, both of which in our judgment are appropriate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio: the alll and the aulc. combined, these reserves comprise the total acl. our credit administration group is responsible for developing the methodology assumptions and estimates used in the calculation, as well as determining the appropriateness of the acl. the alll represents the estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the reported date. additions to the alll result from recording provision expense for loan losses or increased risk levels resulting from loan risk-rating downgrades, while reductions reflect charge-offs (net of recoveries), decreased risk levels resulting from loan risk-rating upgrades, or the sale of loans. the aulc is determined by applying the transaction reserve process to the unfunded portion of the loan exposures adjusted by an applicable funding expectation.
we regularly evaluate the appropriateness of the acl by performing on-going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio, including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or other documented support. we evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date. in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above, we also consider the impact of collateral value trends and portfolio diversification. a provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the acl to the level we have determined to be appropriate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio.
our acl evaluation process includes the on-going assessment of credit quality metrics, and a comparison of certain acl benchmarks to current performance. while the total acl balance has declined in recent quarters, all of the relevant benchmarks remain strong.

the c&i acl increased $21.2 million, or 8%, compared with december 31, 2013, primarily due to the risk rating composition and overall growth in the portfolio. the cre acl decreased $59.7 million, or 37%, compared with december 31, 2013, due to the continued improving portfolio asset quality metrics and performance. the current portfolio management practices focus on increasing borrower equity in the projects, and recent underwriting includes meaningfully lower ltv. the december 31, 2014, cre acl covers nals by more than two times. the home equity portfolio alll declined, consistent with the improving credit quality metrics. the alll for the other consumer portfolio is consistent with expectations given the increasing level of overdraft exposure. the reduction in the acl, compared with december 31, 2013, is primarily a function of the decline in the cre portfolio and improving economic conditions.
compared with december 31, 2013, the aulc decreased $2.1 million, primarily reflecting the impact of an updated assessment of the unfunded commercial exposure.
the acl to total loans declined to 1.40% at december 31, 2014, compared to 1.65% at december 31, 2013. management believes the decline in the ratio is appropriate given the continued improvement in the risk profile of our loan portfolio. further, the continued focus on early identification of loans with changes in credit metrics and proactive action plans for these loans, combined with originating high quality new loans will contribute to maintaining our strong key credit quality metrics.
given the combination of these noted positive and negative factors, we believe that our acl is appropriate and its coverage level is reflective of the quality of our portfolio and the current operating environment.
ncos any loan in any portfolio may be charged-off prior to the policies described below if a loss confirming event has occurred. loss confirming events include, but are not limited to, bankruptcy (unsecured), continued delinquency, foreclosure, or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a collateral deficiency and that asset is the sole source of repayment. additionally, discharged, collateral dependent non-reaffirmed debt in chapter 7 bankruptcy filings will result in a charge-off to estimated collateral value, less anticipated selling costs at the time of discharge.
c&i and cre loans are either charged-off or written down to net realizable value at 90-days past due. automobile loans and other consumer loans are charged-off at 120-days past due. first-lien and junior-lien home equity loans are charged-off to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less anticipated selling costs, at 150-days past due and 120-days past due, respectively. residential mortgages are charged-off to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less anticipated selling costs, at 150-days past due.
the following table reflects nco detail for each of the last five years:

in assessing nco trends, it is helpful to understand the process of how commercial loans are treated as they deteriorate over time. the alll established is consistent with the level of risk associated with the original underwriting. as a part of our normal portfolio management process for commercial loans, the loan is periodically reviewed and the alll is increased or decreased based on the updated risk rating. in certain cases, the standard alll is determined to not be appropriate, and a specific reserve is established based on the projected cash flow or collateral value of the specific loan. charge-offs, if necessary, are generally recognized in a period after the specific alll was established. if the previously established alll exceeds that necessary to satisfactorily resolve the problem loan, a reduction in the overall level of the alll could be recognized. consumer loans are treated in much the same manner as commercial loans, with increasing reserve factors applied based on the risk characteristics of the loan, although specific reserves are not identified for consumer loans. in summary, if loan quality deteriorates, the typical credit sequence would be periods of reserve building, followed by periods of higher ncos as the previously established alll is utilized. additionally, an increase in the alll either precedes or is in conjunction with increases in nals. when a loan is classified as nal, it is evaluated for specific alll or charge-off. as a result, an increase in nals does not necessarily result in an increase in the alll or an expectation of higher future ncos.
all residential mortgage loans greater than 150-days past due are charged-down to the estimated value of the collateral, less anticipated selling costs. the remaining balance is in delinquent status until a modification can be completed, or the loan goes through the foreclosure process. for the home equity portfolio, virtually all of the defaults represent full charge-offs, as there is no remaining equity, creating a lower delinquency rate but a higher nco impact.
ncos decreased $64.0 million, or 34%, in 2014, primarily as a result of continued credit quality. this improvement was partially offset by an increase in c&i primarily relating to large losses associated with a small number of credit relationships.
market risk market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities. we incur market risk in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads. we have identified two primary sources of market risk: interest rate risk and price risk.
interest rate risk overview huntington actively manages interest rate risk, as changes in market interest rates can have a significant impact on reported earnings. the interest rate risk process is designed to compare income simulations in market scenarios designed to alter the direction, magnitude, and speed of interest rate changes, as well as the slope of the yield curve. these scenarios are designed to illustrate the embedded optionality in the balance sheet from, among other things, faster or slower mortgage prepayments and changes in deposit mix.
during the 2014 fourth quarter, we updated various assumptions associated with the modeling of non-maturity deposit behavior as interest rates change. the most significant change was the removal of a stress component that caused forecasted deposit balances to be lower than actual deposit balances. the new assumptions better align the behavior of our non-maturity deposits with our experience and expectations. the assumption changes primarily impacted eve at risk by making the +100 and +200 shock scenarios less liability sensitive. the assumption changes did not materially impact the nii at risk. the results are further discussed below.
income simulation and economic value analysis interest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the alco monthly and roc at least quarterly. the information reported includes period-end results and identifies any policy limits exceeded, along with an assessment of the policy limit breach and the action plan and timeline for resolution, mitigation, or assumption of the risk.
huntington uses two approaches to model interest rate risk: net interest income at risk (nii at risk) and economic value of equity (eve). under nii at risk, net interest income is modeled utilizing various assumptions for assets, liabilities, and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a one-year time horizon. eve measures the period end market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities and the change in this value as rates change. eve is a period end measurement.
table 20net interest income at risk net interest income at risk (%)
basis point change scenario         -25                      +100                     +200
through december 31, 2013, we reported ise at risk. we now report nii at risk to isolate the change in income related solely to interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. the difference between the results for ise at risk and nii at risk are not significant for this or any previous fiscal year.
the nii at risk results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management. it models gradual -25, +100 and +200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates, implied by the forward yield curve over the next one-year period. due to the current low level of short-term interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of 25 basis points, the point at which many assets and liabilities reach zero percent.
huntington is within board policy limits for the +100 and +200 basis point scenarios. there is no policy limit for the -25 basis point scenario. the nii at risk reported at december 31, 2014, shows that huntingtons earnings are not particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates over the next year. in recent periods, the amount of fixed rate assets, primarily indirect auto loans and securities, increased resulting in a reduction in asset sensitivity. this reduction is somewhat accentuated by our portfolio of mortgage-related loans and securities, whose expected maturities lengthen as rates rise. the reduced asset sensitivity for the +200 basis points scenario (relative to the +100 basis points scenario) relates to the modeled migration of money market accounts balances into cds thereby shifting deposits from a variable rate to a fixed rate.
table 21economic value of equity at risk economic value of equity at risk (%)
basis point change scenario          -25                     +100                      +200
the eve results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management. it models immediate -25, +100 and +200 basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates. due to the current low level of short-term interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of 25 basis points, the point at which many assets and liabilities reach zero percent.
huntington is within board policy limits for the +100 and +200 basis point scenarios. there is no policy limit for the -25 basis point scenario. the eve reported at december 31, 2014 shows that as interest rates increase (decrease) immediately, the economic value of equity position will decrease (increase). when interest rates rise, fixed rate assets generally lose economic value; the longer the duration, the greater the value lost. the opposite is true when interest rates fall. the eve at risk reported as of december 31, 2014 for the +200 basis points scenario shows a change to a less liability sensitive position compared with december 31, 2013. the primary factor contributing to this change was the impact of substantially lower interest rates. in addition, the assumption changes mentioned above reduced liability sensitivity in the +200 basis point scenario by +3.4%.
(this section should be read in conjunction with note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.)
at december 31, 2014 we had a total of $155.6 million of capitalized msrs representing the right to service $15.6 billion in mortgage loans. of this $155.6 million, $22.8 million was recorded using the fair value method and $132.8 million was recorded using the amortization method.
msr fair values are very sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be greatly reduced by prepayments. prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise. we have employed strategies to reduce the risk of msr fair value changes or impairment. however, volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these hedges. we typically report msr fair value adjustments net of hedge-related trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income. changes in fair value between reporting dates are recorded as an increase or a decrease in mortgage banking income.
msrs recorded using the amortization method generally relate to loans originated with historically low interest rates, resulting in a lower probability of prepayments and, ultimately, impairment. msr assets are included in accrued income and other assets in the consolidated financial statements.
price risk price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting. we have price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our broker-dealer subsidiaries, foreign exchange positions, equity investments, investments in securities backed by mortgage loans, and marketable equity securities held by our insurance subsidiaries. we have established loss limits on the trading portfolio, on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained, and on the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held by the insurance subsidiaries.
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments resulting from external macro market issues, investor and customer perception of financial strength, and events unrelated to us, such as war, terrorism, or financial institution market specific issues. in addition, the mix and maturity structure of huntingtons balance sheet, the amount of on-hand cash and unencumbered securities, and the availability of contingent sources of funding can have an impact on huntingtons ability to satisfy current or future funding commitments. we manage liquidity risk at both the bank and the parent company.
the overall objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we can obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and future obligations, and can maintain sufficient levels of on-hand liquidity, under both normal business-as-usual and unanticipated stressed circumstances. the alco was appointed by the roc to oversee liquidity risk management and the establishment of liquidity risk policies and limits. contingency funding plans are in place, which measure forecasted sources and uses of funds under various scenarios in order to prepare for unexpected liquidity shortages. liquidity risk is reviewed monthly for the bank and the parent company, as well as its subsidiaries. in addition, liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions, provide policy guidance, review funding strategies, and oversee the adherence to, and maintenance of, the contingency funding plans.
(this section should be read in conjunction with note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.)
our investment securities portfolio is evaluated under established asset/liability management objectives. changing market conditions could affect the profitability of the portfolio, as well as the level of interest rate risk exposure.
our available-for-sale and other securities portfolio is comprised of various financial instruments. at december 31, 2014, our available-for-sale and other securities portfolio totaled $9.4 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion from 2013. the duration of the portfolio decreased by 0.3 years to 3.9 years.

investment securities portfolio the expected weighted average maturities of our afs and htm portfolios are significantly shorter than their contractual maturities as reflected in note 4 and note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. particularly regarding the mbs and abs, prepayments of principal and interest that historically occur in advance of scheduled maturities will shorten the expected life of these portfolios. the expected weighted average maturities, which take into account expected prepayments of principal and interest under existing interest rate conditions, are shown in the following table:

bank liquidity and sources of funding our primary sources of funding for the bank are retail and commercial core deposits. as of december 31, 2014, these core deposits funded 73% of total assets (102% of total loans). at december 31, 2014, total core deposits represented 94% of total deposits, a slight decrease from december 31, 2013, when core deposits represented 95% of total deposits.
core deposits may increase our need for liquidity as certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity and as nonmaturity deposits, such as checking and savings account balances, are withdrawn. to the extent we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through core deposits, we may meet our liquidity needs through other sources, asset securitization, or sale. other sources include non-core deposits, fhlb advances, and other wholesale debt instruments.

note 9 to consolidated financial statements discusses short-term borrowings for each of the last five years.
the bank maintains borrowing capacity at the fhlb and the federal reserve bank discount window. the bank does not consider borrowing capacity from the federal reserve bank discount window as a primary source of liquidity. total loans and securities pledged to the federal reserve discount window and the fhlb are $18.0 billion and $19.8 billion at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
in february 2014, the bank issued $500.0 million of senior notes at 99.842% of face value. the senior bank note issuances mature on april 1, 2019 and have a fixed coupon rate of 2.20%. in april 2014, the bank issued $500.0 million of senior notes at 99.842% of face value. the senior note issuances mature on april 24, 2017 and have a fixed coupon rate of 1.375%. in april 2014, the bank also issued $250.0 million of senior notes at 100% of face value. the senior bank note issuances mature on april 24, 2017 and have a variable coupon rate equal to the three-month libor plus 0.425%. all senior note issuances may be redeemed one month prior to their maturity date at 100% of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest.
liquidity coverage ratio on october 24, 2013, the u.s. banking regulators jointly issued a proposal that would implement a quantitative liquidity requirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) standard established by the basel committee on banking supervision. the lcr is designed to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks to which it applies.
on september 3, 2014, the u.s. banking regulators adopted a final lcr for internationally active banking organizations, generally those with $250 billion or more in total assets, and a modified lcr rule for banking organizations, similar to huntington, with $50 billion or more in total assets that are not internationally active banking organizations. the modified lcr requires huntington to maintain high quality liquid assets (hqla) to meet its net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period, which takes into account the potential impact of idiosyncratic and market-wide shocks. the modified lcr transition period begins on january 1, 2016, with huntington required to maintain hqla equal to 90 percent of the stated requirement. the ratio increases to 100 percent on january 1, 2017. huntington expects to be compliant with the modified lcr requirement within the transition periods established in the modified lcr rule.
at december 31, 2014, we believe the bank had sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable future.

at december 31, 2014, afs securities, with a fair value of $3.6 billion, were pledged to secure public and trust deposits, interest rate swap agreements, u.s. treasury demand notes, and securities sold under repurchase agreements.
parent company liquidity the parent companys funding requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders, debt service, income taxes, operating expenses, funding of nonbank subsidiaries, repurchases of our stock, and acquisitions. the parent company obtains funding to meet obligations from dividends and interest received from the bank, interest and dividends received from direct subsidiaries, net taxes collected from subsidiaries included in the federal consolidated tax return, fees for services provided to subsidiaries, and the issuance of debt securities.
on january 21, 2015, the board of directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.06 per common share. the dividend is payable on april 1, 2015, to shareholders of record on march 18, 2015. based on the current quarterly dividend of $0.06
per common share, cash demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be approximately $48.7 million per quarter. on january 21, 2015, the board of directors declared a quarterly series a and series b preferred stock dividend payable on april 15, 2015 to shareholders of record on april 1, 2015. based on the current dividend, cash demands required for series a preferred stock are estimated to be approximately $7.7 million per quarter. cash demands required for series b preferred stock are expected to be approximately $0.3 million per quarter.
during 2014, the bank paid dividends of $244.0 million to the holding company. we anticipate that the bank will declare additional dividends to the holding company in the first quarter of 2015. to help meet any additional liquidity needs, we have an open-ended, automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the sec, which permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities.
with the exception of the items discussed above, the parent company does not have any significant cash demands. it is our policy to keep operating cash on hand at the parent company to satisfy cash demands for at least the next 18 months. considering the factors discussed above, and other analyses that we have performed, we believe the parent company has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable future.
off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business, we enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements. these arrangements include interest rate swaps, financial guarantees contained in standby letters-of-credit issued by the bank, and commitments by the bank to sell mortgage loans.
interest rate swaps balance sheet hedging activity is arranged to receive hedge accounting treatment and is classified as either fair value or cash flow hedges. fair value hedges are purchased to convert deposits and subordinated and other long-term debt from fixed-rate obligations to floating rate. cash flow hedges are also used to convert floating rate loans made to customers into fixed rate loans. see note 18 for more information.
standby letters-of-credit standby letters-of-credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. most of these arrangements mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon. standby letters-of-credit are included in the determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the parent company and the bank are required to hold. through our credit process, we monitor the credit risks of outstanding standby letters-of-credit. when it is probable that a standby letter-of-credit will be drawn and not repaid in full, a loss is recognized in the provision for credit losses. see note 20 for more information.
commitments to sell loans activity relating to our mortgage origination activity supports the hedging of the mortgage pricing commitments to customers and the secondary sale to third parties. at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, we had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of $545.0 million and $452.6 million, respectively. these contracts mature in less than one year.
we do not believe that off-balance sheet arrangements will have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources.

operational risk as with all companies, we are subject to operational risk. operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error; inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, including the use of financial or other quantitative methodologies that may not adequately predict future results; violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards; and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, and security risks. we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws, rules, and regulations, and to improve the oversight of our operational risk. for example, we actively and continuously monitor cyber-attacks such as attempts related to online deception and loss of sensitive customer data. we evaluate internal systems, processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyber-attacks and, to date, have not experienced any material losses. in addition, we are investing significantly in an effort to minimize these risks.
to mitigate operational risks, we have a senior management operational risk committee and a senior management legal, regulatory, and compliance committee. the responsibilities of these committees, among other duties, include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns, risks, or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues. in addition, we have a senior management model risk oversight committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise. these committees report any significant findings and recommendations to the risk management committee. potential concerns may be escalated to our roc, as appropriate.
our objective for cyber security is to recognize events and respond before the attacker has the opportunity to plan and execute on their goals. to this end we employ strategies to make huntington less attractive as a target, while investing in threat analytic capabilities for rapid detection and response. potential concerns related to cyber security may be escalated to our technology committee, as appropriate.
the goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk techniques and strategies, minimize operational and fraud losses, minimize the impact of inadequately designed models and enhance our overall performance.
representation and warranty reserve we primarily conduct our mortgage loan sale and securitization activity with fnma and fhlmc. in connection with these and other securitization transactions, we make certain representations and warranties that the loans meet certain criteria, such as collateral type and underwriting standards. we may be required to repurchase individual loans and / or indemnify these organizations against losses due to a loan not meeting the established criteria. we have a reserve for such losses and exposure, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities. the reserves are estimated based on historical and expected repurchase activity, average loss rates, and current economic trends. the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses depends upon economic factors, investor demand strategies and other external conditions containing a level of uncertainty and risk that may change over the life of the underlying loans. we currently do not have sufficient information to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss related to representation and warranty exposure.

compliance risk financial institutions are subject to many laws, rules, and regulations at both the federal and state levels. in september, for example, the office of the comptroller of the currency issued its final rule formalizing its heightened expectations supervisory regime for the largest federally chartered depository institutions, including huntington, to improve risk management and ensure boards can challenge decisions made by management. these broad-based laws, rules and regulations include, but are not limited to, expectations relating to anti-money laundering, lending limits, client privacy, fair lending, prohibitions against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, protections for military members as they enter active duty, and community reinvestment. additionally, the volume and complexity of recent regulatory changes have increased our overall compliance risk. as such, we utilize various resources to help ensure expectations are met, including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. our colleagues receive training for several broad-based laws and regulations including, but not limited to, anti-money laundering and customer privacy. additionally, colleagues engaged in lending activities receive training for laws and regulations related to flood disaster protection, equal credit opportunity, fair lending, and / or other courses related to the extension of credit. we set a high standard of expectation for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance.
capital
(this section should be read in conjunction with the regulatory matters section included in part 1, item 1 and note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.)
both regulatory capital and shareholders equity are managed at the bank and on a consolidated basis. we have an active program for managing capital and maintain a comprehensive process for assessing the companys overall capital adequacy. we believe our current levels of both regulatory capital and shareholders equity are adequate.
regulatory capital the following table presents risk-weighted assets and other financial data necessary to calculate certain financial ratios, including the tier 1 common equity ratio on a basel i basis, which we use to measure capital adequacy. we estimate the negative impact to tier i common risk-based capital from the 2015 first quarter implementation of the federal reserves final basel iii capital rules will be approximately 40 bps on a fully phased-in basis.

the following table presents certain regulatory capital data at both the consolidated and bank levels for the past five years:

(1)   in accordance with applicable regulatory reporting guidance, we are not required to retrospectively update historical filings for newly adopted accounting principles. therefore, regulatory capital data has not been updated for the adoption of asu 2014-01.
the decreases in the capital ratios were due to balance sheet growth and share repurchases that were partially offset by retained earnings and the 8.7 million common shares issued in the camco financial acquisition. specifically, all capital ratios were impacted by the repurchase of 35.7 million common shares in 2014.
shareholders equity we generate shareholders equity primarily through the retention of earnings, net of dividends. other potential sources of shareholders equity include issuances of common and preferred stock. our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance objectives, to meet both regulatory and market expectations, and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and business opportunities. shareholders equity totaled $6.3 billion at december 31, 2014, representing a $0.2 billion, or 4%, increase compared with december 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in retained earnings offset by share repurchases.
dividends we consider disciplined capital management as a key objective, with dividends representing one component. our strong capital ratios and expectations for continued earnings growth positions us to continue to actively explore additional capital management opportunities.
on january 22, 2015, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per common share, payable on april 1, 2015. also, cash dividends of $0.06 per common share were declared on october 15, 2014, and $0.05 per common share were declared on july 16, 2014, april 16, 2014 and january 16, 2014. our 2014 capital plan to the frb included the continuation of our current common dividend through the 2015 first quarter.
on january 22, 2015, our board of directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend on our 8.50% series a non-cumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock of $21.25 per share. the dividend is payable on april 15, 2015. cash dividends of $21.25 per share were also declared on october 15, 2014, july 16, 2014, april 16, 2014 and january 16, 2014.
on january 22, 2015, our board of directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend on our floating rate series b non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock of $7.38 per share. the dividend is payable on april 15, 2015. also, cash dividends of $7.33, $7.33, $7.32 and $7.35 per share were declared on october 15, 2014, july 16, 2014, april 16, 2014 and january 16, 2014, respectively.
share repurchases from time to time the board of directors authorizes the company to repurchase shares of our common stock. although we announce when the board of directors authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. future stock repurchases may be private or open-market repurchases, including block transactions, accelerated or delayed block transactions, forward transactions, and similar transactions. various factors determine the amount and timing of our share repurchases, including our capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations, including the frbs response to our capital plan.
on march 26, 2014, huntington announced that the federal reserve did not object to huntingtons proposed capital actions included in huntingtons capital plan submitted to the federal reserve in january 2014. these actions included a potential repurchase of up to $250 million of common stock from the second quarter of 2014 through the first quarter of 2015. huntingtons board of directors authorized a share repurchase program consistent with huntingtons capital plan. this repurchase authorization represents a $23 million, or 10%, increase from the prior common stock repurchase authorization. during 2014, we repurchased 35.7 million shares, with a weighted average price of $9.37. purchases of common stock may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, and accelerated repurchase programs. we have approximately $51.7 million remaining under the current authorization.
business segment discussion overview our business segments are based on our internally-aligned segment leadership structure, which is how we monitor results and assess performance. during the 2014 first quarter, we reorganized our business segments to drive our ongoing growth and leverage the knowledge of our highly experienced team. we now have five major business segments: retail and business banking,
business segment results are determined based upon our management reporting system, which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments. the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and, accordingly, the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions.
revenue sharing revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service. fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to, or providing service to customers. results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations.
expense allocation the management accounting process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments. expenses are allocated to business segments using a two-phase approach. the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs (activity-based costs) to activities related to product origination and servicing. these activity-based costs are then extended, based on volumes, with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products. the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all five business segments from treasury / other. we utilize a full-allocation methodology, where all treasury / other expenses, except reported significant items, and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses, are allocated to the five business segments.
we use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate income to the business segments. the intent of the ftp methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities. the result is to centralize the financial impact, management, and reporting of interest rate risk in the treasury / other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed. the treasury / other function charges (credits) an internal cost of funds for assets held in (or pays for funding provided by) each business segment. the ftp rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets (or liabilities).
net income by business segment the segregation of net income by business segment for the past three years is presented in the following table:
table 33net income by business segment year ended december 31,
retail and business banking               $172,199                   $128,973                   $139,016
treasury / other the treasury / other function includes revenue and expense related to assets, liabilities, and equity not directly assigned or allocated to one of the five business segments. other assets include investment securities and bank owned life insurance. the financial impact associated with our ftp methodology, as described above, is also included.
net interest income includes the impact of administering our investment securities portfolios and the net impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity. noninterest income includes miscellaneous fee income not allocated to other business segments, such as bank owned life insurance income and any investment security and trading asset gains or losses. noninterest expense includes certain corporate administrative, merger, and other miscellaneous expenses not allocated to other business segments. the provision for
income taxes for the business segments is calculated at a statutory 35% tax rate, though our overall effective tax rate is lower. as a result, treasury / other reflects a credit for income taxes representing the difference between the lower actual effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate used to allocate income taxes to the business segments.
optimal customer relationship (ocr)
our ocr strategy is focused on building and deepening relationships with our customers through superior interactions, product penetration, and quality of service. we will deliver high-quality customer and prospect interactions through a fully integrated sales culture which will include all partners necessary to deliver a total huntington solution the quality of our relationships will lead to our ability to be the primary bank for our customers, yielding quality, annuitized revenue and profitable share of customers overall financial services revenue. we believe our relationship oriented approach will drive a competitive advantage through our local market delivery channels.
consumer ocr performance for consumer ocr performance there are three key performance metrics: (1) the number of checking account households, (2) the number of product penetration per consumer checking household, and (3) the revenue generated from the consumer households of all business segments.
the growth in consumer checking account number of households is a result of both new sales of checking accounts and improved retention of existing checking account households. the overall objective is to grow the number of households, along with an increase in product penetration.
we use the checking account since it typically represents the primary banking relationship product. we count additional services by type, not number of services. for example, a household that has one checking account and one mortgage, we count as having two services. a household with four checking accounts, we count as having one service. the household relationship utilizing four or more services is viewed to be more profitable and loyal. the overall objective, therefore, is to decrease the percentage of 1-3 services per consumer checking account household, while increasing the percentage of those with 4 or more services. since we have made significant strides toward having the vast majority of our customers with 4+ services, during the 2013 second quarter, we changed our measurement to 6+ services. we are holding ourselves to a higher performance standard.

(3)   on september 12, 2014, huntington acquired 37,939 bank of america households.
our emphasis on cross-sell, coupled with customers being attracted by the benefits offered through our fair play banking philosophy with programs such as 24-hour grace® on overdrafts and asterisk-free checking, are having a positive effect. the percent of consumer households with 6 or more products services at the end of 2014 was 49.4%, up from 47.6% at the end of last year. for 2014, consumer checking account households grew 10%. total consumer checking account household revenue in 2014 was $1,017.0 million, up $68.9 million, or 7%, from 2013.
commercial ocr performance for commercial ocr performance, there are three key performance metrics: (1) the number of commercial relationships, (2) the number of services penetration per commercial relationship, and (3) the revenue generated. commercial relationships include relationships from all business segments.
the growth in the number of commercial relationships is a result of both new sales of checking accounts and improved retention of existing commercial accounts. the overall objective is to grow the number of relationships, along with an increase in product service distribution.
the commercial relationship is defined as a business banking or commercial banking customer with a checking account relationship. we use this metric because we believe that the checking account anchors a business relationship and creates the opportunity to increase our cross-sell. multiple sales of the same type of service are counted as one service, the same as consumer.
product penetration by number of services (2)
1 service                                                    15.7    %                 21.1    %                 24.6   %
2-3 services                                                 42.4                      41.4                      40.4
4+ services                                                  41.9                      37.5                      35.0
by focusing on targeted relationships we are able to achieve higher product service penetration among our commercial relationships, and leverage these relationships to generate a deeper share of wallet. the percent of commercial relationships with 4 or more product services at the end of 2014 was 41.9%, up from 37.5% at the end of last year. total commercial relationship revenue in 2014 was $851.0 million, up $112.5 million, or 15%, from 2013.

retail and business banking reported net income of $172.2 million in 2014. this was an increase of $43.2 million, or 34%, compared to the year-ago period. the increase in net income reflected a combination of factors described below.
partially offset by:
   a $40.7 million, or 31%, decrease in ncos, combined with improved credit metrics on business banking and consumer loans.
   $275 million, or 3%, increase in consumer loans, primarily due to growth in home equity lines of credit, credit cards, and residential mortgages, as well as the impact of the camco financial acquisition.
   $121 million, or 3%, increase in commercial loans, primarily due to c&amp;i loan growth and the impact of the camco financial acquisition.
   $237 million deposit growth from our in-store branch network.
                 a continued focus on product mix in reducing the overall cost of deposits as evidenced by an increase in money market and noninterest bearing deposits, partially offset by a decrease in core certificates of deposit. in addition, the acquisition of camco financial and 24 bank of america branches contributed to the deposit increase.
   $12.8 million, or 14%, increase in electronic banking income, primarily due to strong consumer household growth combined with increased consumer card activity.
   $2.9 million, or 19%, increase in gain on sale of loans, primarily due to the increased origination and sale of sba loans.
partially offset by:
   $5.2 million, or 14%, increase in outside data processing and other services expense, mainly the result of transaction costs associated with card activity.
partially offset by:
   $10.4 million, or 4%, decrease in personnel costs, primarily due to the pension plan curtailment in 2013, branch consolidations, and various efficiency improvement initiatives also contributed to the decrease in personnel costs.
   $1.5 million, or 3%, reduction in marketing, primarily due to reduced direct mail advertising.
retail and business banking reported net income of $129.0 million in 2013, compared with a net income of $139.0 million in 2012. the $10.0 million decrease included a $39.3 million, or 4%, decrease in net interest income, partially offset by a $17.2 million, or 5%, increase noninterest income, and a $9.5 million, or 1%, decrease in noninterest expense.

commercial banking reported net income of $152.7 million in 2014. this was an increase of $22.7 million, or 17%, compared to the year-ago period. the increase in net income reflected a combination of factors described below.
partially offset by:
                                           19 basis point decrease in the net interest margin, primarily due to a 9 basis point compression in commercial loan spreads, driven by a 6 basis point compression stemming from growth in the international portfolio with products such as bankers acceptances and foreign insured receivables, as well as compressed deposit margins resulting from declining rates and reduced ftp rates.
   an increase related to loan growth and an $8.0 million increase in ncos. the increase in ncos primarily reflects a net recovery in the prior year and the return to net charge-offs in 2014.
   $0.9 billion increase in available-for-sale securities driven from the addition of direct purchase municipal instruments. these instruments had been classified as c&amp;i loans until december 31, 2013.
   $0.5 billion, or 100%, increase in the asset based lending portfolio average balance, which was transferred from the afcre segment retroactive to the beginning of 2014.
   $1.1 billion, or 13%, increase in core deposits. middle market accounts, such as not-for-profit universities and healthcare, primarily contributed to the balance growth.
partially offset by:
   $9.9 million, or 100%, increase in fee income associated with the asset based lending portfolio, which was transferred from the afcre segment retroactive to the beginning of 2014.
   $4.2 million, or 9%, increase in service charges on deposit accounts and other treasury management related revenue, primarily due to a new commercial card product implemented in 2013, as well as strong core cash management growth.

partially offset by:
                                 21 basis point decrease in the net interest margin, primarily due to an 20 basis point reduction in loan spreads. this decline primarily reflects the impact of competitive pricing pressures in all of our portfolios, partially offset by a $5.1 million, or 4 basis points, recovery in 2014 from the unexpected pay-off of an acquired commercial real estate loan.
   $0.3 billion, or 100%, decrease in asset based lending portfolio average balances which were transferred to the commercial banking segment retroactive to the beginning of 2014.
   less improvement in credit quality than what was experienced in the year-ago period, reflecting a 23 basis point decline in npa/loans in the current period compared to a 51 basis point decline in the year-ago period, partially offset by lower ncos.
                                                   $18.0 million, or 44%, decrease in other noninterest income, primarily due to a $8.6 million decrease in fee income associated with the asset based lending portfolio which was transferred to the commercial banking segment, as well as decreases in market related gains associated with certain loans and investments carried at fair value, operating lease related income and servicing income on securitized automobile loans.
   $9.3 million, or 10%, increase in other noninterest expense, primarily due to a $12.5 million increase in allocated expenses, generally reflecting higher levels of business activity.
partially offset by:
   $2.8 million, or 9%, decrease in personnel costs, primarily due to staffing associated with the asset based lending portfolio which was transferred to the commercial banking segment retroactive to the beginning of 2014.

home lending reported a net loss of $19.7 million in 2014. this was a decrease of $22.4 million, when compared to the year-ago period. the decrease in net income reflected a combination of factors described below.
partially offset by:
   the transfer of a $7.6 million loan portfolio to loans held-for-sale in 2014, partially offset by lower ncos.
   $32.9 million, or 33%, decrease in mortgage banking income, primarily due to a reduction in volume and gain on sale related to lower refinancing levels.
   $2.0 million, or 9%, decrease in other noninterest expense, primarily due to lower mortgage repurchase expense and partially offset by the $3.0 million goodwill impairment.
partially offset by:

   $1.0 billion, or 74%, increase in brokered deposits and negotiated cds, which were used to efficiently finance balance sheet growth while continuing to manage the overall cost of funds.
partially offset by:
   $0.9 billion, or 22%, decrease in average core certificates of deposit due to the strategic focus on changing the funding sources to no-cost demand deposits and lower-cost money market deposits.
provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses decreased $21.8 million to $2.5 million in the 2014 fourth quarter reflecting the current quarters higher-than-expected level of commercial recoveries and 34% decrease in nals within the cre portfolio. ncos decreased to $23.0 million with less than $1.0 million of ncos within the total commercial portfolio. ncos equated to an annualized 0.20% of average loans and leases in the current quarter compared to 0.43% in the year-ago quarter.

             $13.7 million, or 6%, increase in personnel costs. excluding the impact of significant items, personnel costs increased $11.6 million, or 5%, primarily related to a $9.0 million increase in salaries reflecting 1% increase in the number of full-time equivalent employees and a $3.8 million increase in health insurance costs.
   $11.9 million, or 31%, increase in other expense. excluding the impact of significant items, other expenses increased $1.2 million, or 3%.

   $3.2 million, or 11%, increase in equipment. excluding the impact of significant items, equipment expenses increased $2.0 million, or 7%, primarily reflecting higher depreciation expense.
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes in the 2014 fourth quarter was $57.2 million and $52.0 million in the 2013 fourth quarter. the effective tax rates for the 2014 fourth quarter and 2013 fourth quarter were 25.9% and 24.8%, respectively. at december 31, 2014, we had a net federal deferred tax asset of $72.1 million and a net state deferred tax asset of $45.3 million. as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, there was no disallowed deferred tax asset for regulatory capital purposes.
credit quality credit quality performance in the 2014 fourth quarter reflected continued improvement in the overall loan portfolio relating to nco activity, as well as in key credit quality metrics.
ncos total ncos for the 2014 fourth quarter were $23.0 million, or an annualized 0.20% of average total loans and leases. ncos in the year-ago quarter were $46.4 million, or an annualized 0.43%. these declines reflected improvement in the overall credit quality of the portfolio.
nals nals decreased $21.8 million, or 7%, compared to a year ago to $300.2 million, or 0.63% of total loans and leases. npas decreased $14.4 million, or 4%, to $337.7 million, or 0.71% of total loans and leases, oreo, and other npas.
(this section should be read in conjunction with note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.)
acl as a percent of total loans and leases at december 31, 2014, was 1.40%, down from 1.65% at december 31, 2013. we believe the decline in the ratio is appropriate given the continued improvement in the risk profile of our loan portfolio. further, we believe that early identification of loans with changes in credit metrics and aggressive action plans for these loans, combined with originating high quality new loans will contribute to maintaining our key credit quality metrics.

additional disclosures forward-looking statements this report, including md&a, contains certain forward-looking statements, including certain plans, expectations, goals, projections, and statements, which are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. statements that do not describe historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as expect, anticipate, believe, intend, estimate, plan, target, goal, or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as will, may, might, should, would, could, or similar variations. the forward-looking statements are intended to be subject to the safe harbor provided by section 27a of the securities act of 1933, section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
while there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are certain factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in the forward-looking statements: (1) worsening of credit quality performance due to a number of factors such as the underlying value of collateral that could prove less valuable than otherwise assumed and assumed cash flows may be worse than expected; (2) changes in general economic, political, or industry conditions; uncertainty in u.s. fiscal and monetary policy, including the interest rate policies of the federal reserve board; volatility and disruptions in global capital and credit markets; (3) movements in interest rates; (4) competitive pressures on product pricing and services; (5) success, impact, and timing of our business strategies, including market acceptance of any new products or services implementing our fair play banking philosophy; (6) changes in accounting policies and principles and the accuracy of our
assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements; (7) extended disruption of vital infrastructure; (8) the final outcome of significant litigation; (9) the nature, extent, timing, and results of governmental actions, examinations, reviews, reforms, regulations, and interpretations, including those related to the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and the basel iii regulatory capital reforms, as well as those involving the occ, federal reserve, fdic, and cfpb; and (10) the outcome of judicial and regulatory decisions regarding practices in the residential mortgage industry, including among other things the processes followed for foreclosing residential mortgages.
all forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and are based on information available at that time. we assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements were made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events except as required by federal securities laws. as forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, caution should be exercised against placing undue reliance on such statements.
non-regulatory capital ratios in addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including:
   tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets using basel i and basel iii definitions, and
   tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets using basel i definition.
these non-regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the companys capitalization to other financial services companies. these ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. these ratios are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) or federal banking regulations. as a result, these non-regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the company are considered non-gaap financial measures.
because there are no standardized definitions for these non-regulatory capital ratios, the companys calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies. also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. as a result, the company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this form 10-k in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.
risk factors more information on risk is set forth under the heading risk factors included in item 1a and incorporated by reference into this md&a. additional information regarding risk factors can also be found in the risk management and capital discussion, as well as the regulatory matters section included in item 1 and incorporated by reference into the md&a.
critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference into this md&a, describes the significant accounting policies we use in our consolidated financial statements.
an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time, and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. the most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below.
allowance for credit losses our acl of $0.7 billion at december 31, 2014, represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. we regularly review our acl for appropriateness by performing on-going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio. in doing so, we consider factors such as the differing economic risk associated
with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or other documented support. we also evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date. there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions, or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or markets. if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates, the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, or if the acl is not appropriate, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, bank regulators periodically review our acl and may require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or loan charge-offs. any increase in our acl or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
valuation of financial instruments assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. assets measured at fair value include mortgage loans held for sale, available-for-sale and trading securities, certain securitized automobile loans, derivatives, and certain securitization trust notes payable. at december 31, 2014, approximately $9.9 billion of our assets and $0.3 billion of our liabilities were recorded at fair value. in addition to the above mentioned on-going fair value measurements, fair value is also the unit of measure for recording business combinations and other non-recurring financial assets and liabilities.
at the end of each quarter, we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured at fair value. as necessary, assets or liabilities may be transferred within fair value hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date.
where available, we use quoted market prices to determine fair value. if quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined, using either internally developed or independent third party valuation models, based on inputs that are either directly observable or derived from market data. these inputs include, but are not limited to, interest rate yield curves, option volatilities, or option adjusted spreads. where neither quoted market prices nor observable market data are available, fair value is determined using valuation models that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs based on managements expectation that market participants would use in determining the fair value of the asset or liability. the determination of appropriate unobservable inputs requires exercise of management judgment. a significant portion of our assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value are measured based on quoted market prices and observable market or independent inputs.
the following is a description of the significant estimates used in the valuation of financial assets and liabilities for which quoted market prices and observable market parameters are not available.
mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities our alt-a, private label cmo and pooled-trust-preferred securities portfolios are classified as level 3 and as such use significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity. the alt-a and private label cmo securities portfolios are subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows, while the cash flows of our pooled-trust-preferred securities portfolio are reviewed quarterly. these reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties, and are used as a basis for impairment analysis.
alt-a mortgage-backed and private-label cmo securities are collateralized by first-lien residential mortgage loans. the securities valuation methodology incorporates values obtained from a third party pricing specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and a proprietary pricing model and includes assumptions management believes market participants would use to value the securities under current market conditions. the model uses inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds, losses, recoveries, default rates that are implied by the underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar structures, house price depreciation / appreciation rates that are based upon macroeconomic forecasts and discount rates that are implied by market prices for similar securities with similar collateral structures.
pooled-trust-preferred securities are cdos backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions. the collateral generally consists of trust-preferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks, bank holding companies, and insurance companies. a full cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio. we engage a third-party pricing specialist with direct industry experience in pooled-trust-preferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio. the pd of each issuer and the market discount rate are the most significant inputs in determining fair value. management evaluates the pd assumptions provided by the third-party pricing specialist by comparing the current pd to the assumptions used the previous quarter, actual
defaults and deferrals in the current period, and trend data on certain financial ratios of the issuers. huntington also evaluates the assumptions related to discount rates. relying on cash flows is necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities are no longer able to provide a fair value that is compliant with asc 820.
derivatives used for hedging purposes derivatives designated as qualified hedges are tested for hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis. assessments are made at the inception of the hedge and on a recurring basis to determine whether the derivative used in the hedging transaction has been and is expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. a statistical regression analysis is performed to measure the effectiveness.
if, based on the assessment, a derivative is not expected to be a highly effective hedge or it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued as of the quarter the hedge is not highly effective. as the statistical regression analysis requires the use of estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows which are sensitive to significant changes in future periods based on changes in market rates, we consider this a critical accounting estimate.
certain consumer and commercial loans are classified as held for sale and are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. the determination of fair value for these consumer loans is based on security prices for similar product types or discounted expected cash flows, which takes into consideration factors such as future interest rates, prepayment speeds, default and loss curves, and market discount rates. the determination of fair value for commercial loans takes into account factors such as the location and appraised value of the related collateral, as well as the estimated cash flows from realization of the collateral.
mortgage servicing rights retained rights to service mortgage loans are recognized as a separate and distinct asset at the time the loans are sold. mortgage servicing rights (msrs) are initially recorded at fair value at the time the related loans are sold and subsequently re-measured at each reporting date under either the fair value or amortization method. any increase or decrease in fair value of msrs accounted for under the fair value method, as well as any amortization and/or impairment of msrs recorded under the amortization method, is reflected in earnings in the period that the changes occur. msrs are subject to interest rate risk in that their fair value will fluctuate as a result of changes in the interest rate environment. fair value is determined based upon the application of an income approach valuation model. the valuation model, maintained by an independent third party, incorporates assumptions in estimating future cash flows. these assumptions include time decay, payoffs, and changes in valuation inputs and assumptions. the reasonableness of these pricing models is validated on a minimum of a quarterly basis by at least one independent external service broker valuation. because the fair values of msrs are significantly impacted by the use of estimates, the use of different assumption estimates can result in different estimated fair values of those msrs.
contingent liabilities we are parties to various claims, litigation, and legal proceedings resulting from ordinary business activities relating to our current and/or former operations. we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be more or less than the current estimate. our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case or proceeding, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. litigation exposure represents a key area of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and certain factors outside of our control.
income taxes the calculation of our provision for income taxes is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments. we have two accruals for income taxes: (1) our income tax payable represents the estimated net amount currently due to the federal, state, and local taxing jurisdictions, net of any reserve for potential audit issues and any tax refunds, and the net receivable balance is reported as a component of accrued income and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet; (2) our deferred federal and state income tax and related valuation accounts, reported as a component of accrued income and other assets, represents the estimated impact of temporary differences between how we recognize our assets and liabilities under gaap, and how such assets and liabilities are recognized under federal and state tax law.
in the ordinary course of business, we operate in various taxing jurisdictions and are subject to income and non-income taxes. the effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the relevant current tax laws. we believe the aggregate liabilities related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements. we review the appropriate tax treatment of all transactions taking into consideration statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax positions. in addition, we rely on various tax opinions, recent tax audits, and historical experience.
from time-to-time, we engage in business transactions that may affect our tax liabilities. where appropriate, we have obtained opinions of outside experts and have assessed the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of business transactions taking into account statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. however, changes to our estimates of accrued taxes can occur due to changes in tax rates, implementation of new business strategies, resolution of issues with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax positions, and newly enacted statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance. such changes could affect the amount of our accrued taxes and could be material to our financial position and / or results of operations. (see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.)
deferred tax assets at december 31, 2014, we had a net federal deferred tax asset of $72.1 million and a net state deferred tax asset of $45.3 million. a valuation allowance is provided when it is more-likely-than-not some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. all available evidence, both positive and negative, was considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, impairment should be recognized. our forecast process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change. if our forecast of taxable income within the carryforward periods available under applicable law is not sufficient to cover the amount of net deferred tax assets, such assets may be impaired. based on our analysis of both positive and negative evidence and our ability to offset the net deferred tax assets against our forecasted future taxable income, there was no impairment of the net deferred tax assets at december 31, 2014, for regulatory capital purposes.
recent accounting pronouncements and developments note 2 to consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2014 and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted. to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affect financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity, the impacts are discussed in the applicable section of this md&a and the notes to consolidated financial statements.

item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
general this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements, and the accompanying notes elsewhere in this report. when we use the terms we, us, our or similar words in this discussion, unless the context otherwise requires, we are referring to lyondellbasell industries n.v. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
references to industry benchmark prices or costs, including the weighted average cost of ethylene production, are generally to industry prices and costs from third-party consulting data. references to industry benchmarks for refining and oxyfuels market margins are to industry prices reported by platts, a reporting service of the mcgraw-hill companies. references to industry benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas are to bloomberg.
overview our performance is driven by, among other things, global economic conditions generally and their impact on demand for our products, raw material and energy prices, as well as industry-specific issues, such as production capacity. our businesses are generally subject to the cyclicality and volatility seen in the chemicals and refining industries.
we achieved record earnings in 2014 despite the impact of a significant lower of cost or market inventory valuation charge necessitated by the decline in crude oil and correlated product prices in the latter part of the year. we believe our industry position remains favorable and are confident in the fundamentals supporting our businesses. in 2014, we continued to focus on our back-to-basics strategy and high return growth projects, some of which are already contributing to earnings.
   recognized lower of cost or market (lcm) inventory valuation charges affecting all but the technology segment in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 totaling $760 million, pretax ($483 million, after tax);
(o&amp;peai) segment results on higher olefins and polyolefins margins, offset in part by lower north american volumes and supplemented by higher european olefins volumes;
   steady intermediates and derivatives (i&amp;d) segment results reflect higher acetyls and propylene oxide (po) and derivatives results offset in part by lower results for oxyfuels, styrene and ethylene oxide (eo) and derivatives; and
   improved refining margins and higher crude processing rates at our houston refinery.
   we repurchased approximately 63.3 million of our ordinary shares during 2014;
   our wholly owned subsidiary, lyb international finance b.v., issued $1 billion of 4.875% unsecured notes;
                   we continued an ethylene expansion project at our channelview, texas facility, completed an 800 million pound per year ethylene expansion at our la porte, texas facility in the last half of 2014, and a 220 million pound per year polyethylene (pe) expansion of our matagorda, texas facility in the first quarter of 2014;
   in april 2014, we received a permit issued by the environmental protection agency authorizing us to commence an ethylene expansion project at our corpus christi, texas facility;
   we announced plans to build a world scale po/tba plant on the u.s. gulf coast with an annual capacity of 1 billion pounds of po and 2 billion pounds of tertiary butyl alcohol (tba) and its derivatives. based on a preliminary timetable, the plant is currently slated to be operational in 2019; and
      we also announced that we are evaluating a 550 million pounds-per-year ethylene expansion project at our channelview, texas facility. preliminary engineering work is underway to assess expansion feasibility. if we proceed with this project, the anticipated time frame for completion would be 2017.
results of operations for the periods discussed in these results of operations are presented in the table below.
year ended december 31, millions of dollars                             2014                    2013                     2012
sales and other operating revenues                       $45,608                  $44,062                  $45,352
cost of sales                                             38,939                   37,940                   39,595
research and development expenses                            127                      150                      172
operating income                                           5,736                    5,102                    4,676
loss from discontinued operations, net of tax                 (4   )                   (7   )                  (24   )
results of operations revenueswe had revenues of $45,608 million in 2014, $44,062 million in 2013 and $45,352 million in 2012.
higher sales volumes for acetyls, styrene, po and derivatives and refining products, which were offset in part by lower volumes for u.s. olefins and eo and derivatives, contributed to 4% higher revenues in 2014 compared to 2013. higher acetyls sales volumes in 2014 benefited from the restart of our methanol plant at channelview, texas in december 2013. sales volumes for styrene improved in 2014 compared to 2013, which was affected by planned maintenance activities in the u.s. and europe. industry outages in europe and asia in 2014 led to higher volumes for po and derivatives. an increase in sales volumes of refined products in 2014 reflects higher crude processing rates relative to 2013, which was negatively impacted by planned outages at our houston refinery. sales volumes for u.s. polyethylene were favorably affected by firm demand and the completion of an expansion and turnaround of our matagorda, texas polyethylene facility. these increases were
offset in part by lower u.s. olefin sales volumes as 2014 volumes were impacted by an expansion-related turnaround at our la porte, texas facility. unplanned outages in 2014 resulted in lower eo and derivative volumes during that period.
in 2014, higher average sales prices for u.s. polyethylene, polypropylene (pp), pp compounds, po and derivatives, except butanediol (bdo), and vinyl acetate monomer (vam) were offset by lower average sales prices for european polyethylene, butanediol, oxyfuels, c4 chemicals and refining products.
increased demand and industry supply issues in 2014 led to the increase in u.s. polyethylene prices. the improvements in polypropylene prices reflected more favorable market conditions in 2014 versus 2013. global industry constraints and limited regional supply led to increased prices for vam and all of our po and derivatives products, except butanediol, which declined due to excess industry capacity in asia and the middle east. the lower average sales prices for oxyfuels in 2014 reflected the impact of lower brent crude oil and gasoline prices, which was partially offset by a higher octane blending premium. in 2014, the decline in c4 chemicals prices was driven by the lower energy profile, while the average sales prices for refining products reflected the decline in crude oil prices during the fourth quarter of 2014.
2013 versus 2012revenues decreased $1,290 million, or 3%, in 2013 compared to 2012. lower sales volumes in 2013 contributed 4% to the decrease in revenues over 2012. this decline in sales volumes primarily reflects the negative impact of lower crude processing rates at the houston refinery on refining product volumes, which was offset in part by higher olefins sales volumes in our o&pamericas segment. the impact of lower sales volumes was slightly mitigated by the effect of favorable exchange rates, which increased revenues by 1% in 2013 over 2012. average sales prices were relatively unchanged in 2013 compared to 2012.
cost of salescost of sales were $38,939 million in 2014, $37,940 million in 2013 and $39,595 million in 2012.
2014 versus 2013cost of sales increased by $999 million in 2014 compared to 2013. non-cash, lcm charges related to inventories in all but our technology segment were responsible for $760 million of the $999 million increase in cost of sales. these charges, which were recognized in the third and fourth quarters of 2014, were primarily driven by declines in the prices of crude oil and products derived from or correlated to crude oil.
excluding these lcm adjustments, cost of sales increased $239 million in 2014 over 2013 primarily due to the impact of the higher sales volumes discussed above. this volume impact was reduced by the lower cost of crude oil and by the lower cost of ethylene production in the u.s. and europe in 2014 compared to 2013.
2013 versus 2012cost of sales declined by $1,655 million in 2013 compared to 2012. cost of sales in 2012 included benefits totaling $152 million from insurance proceeds associated with a 2008 hurricane, a recovery related to a former employee who pled guilty to fraud and the reversal of a reserve for an unfavorable monomer contract. these 2012 benefits were offset in part by charges totaling $97 million for reorganization activities in europe, facility closure costs in australia and italy and the impairment of a low density polyethylene (ldpe) plant in europe.
apart from these factors, cost of sales was lower in 2013 than in 2012, primarily due the impact of lower sales volumes discussed above and lower feedstock costs. a shift to cracking more natural gas liquids (ngls) in our o&pamericas segment, increased benefits from lpg cracking and the lower cost of naphtha in our o&peai segment, and lower crude oil costs in our refining segment were the most significant contributors to our lower feedstock costs in 2013. these benefits were offset in part by the higher costs of renewable identification numbers (rins) and natural gas in our refining segment and the higher costs of propylene, benzene and natural gas feedstocks in our i&d segment.
operating incomeour operating income was $5,736 million, $5,102 million and $4,676 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
2014 versus 2013operating income increased by $634 million in 2014, which includes the impact of the $760 million lcm inventory valuation adjustment discussed above. this increase primarily reflects the impact of the higher sales volumes discussed above and margins that benefited from lower feedstock costs.
apart from the lcm adjustment, margins were higher in 2014 across all businesses in our o&pamericas and o&peai segments, for po and derivatives, acetyls and oxyfuels in our i&d segment and for refining products in our refining segment. these higher margins were offset in part by lower margins for c4 chemicals, styrene and eo and derivatives in our i&d segment. our higher margins generally reflected our lower cost of ethylene production and the lower cost of crude oil, but in some cases were driven by average sales prices that increased relative to the related feedstock costs. lower margins for styrene and eo and derivatives reflected lower average sales prices compounded by higher feedstock costs and the lower c4 chemicals margins are attributed to falling energy prices.
2013 versus 2012the increase in 2013 operating income reflects higher margins, offset in part by the decline in volumes and the items specific to 2012 discussed above. the lower average cost of feedstocks led to the improvement in margins in 2013, as average sales prices were relatively unchanged compared to 2012.
the higher margins in 2013 were related to olefins and polyethylene in our o&pamericas and o&peai segments and styrene, ethylene oxide/ethylene glycol (eo/eg) and acetyls in our i&d segment. these improvements were partially offset by lower refining margins in our refining segment and lower margins for oxyfuels, bdo and solvents in our i&d segment.
operating results for each of our business segments are reviewed further in the segment analysis section below.
2014 versus 2013the increase in interest expense in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to interest related to the july 2013 issuances of our 4% guaranteed notes due 2023 and 5.25% guaranteed notes due 2043 and the february 2014 issuance of our 4.875% guaranteed notes due 2044. these increases were partially offset by a $28 million net favorable adjustment related to our fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these swaps.
2013 versus 2012interest expense was lower in 2013 compared to 2012, largely due to the refinancing of most of our long-term debt to lower coupon notes and the termination of our u.s. asset-based credit facility in 2012. in connection with the refinancing, we paid $294 million of premiums and wrote off $18 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. we also wrote off $17 million of capitalized debt issuance costs as a result of the termination of our u.s. asset-based credit facility. the benefit of lower interest expense from the refinancing was partially offset in 2013 by interest related to the issuance of our 4% notes due 2023 and 5.25% notes due 2043 discussed above.
other income (expense), netwe had other income, net, of $38 million in 2014, other expense, net, of $15 million in 2013 and other income, net, of $6 million in 2012.
2014 versus 2013the improvement in other income, net, in 2014 compared to 2013 reflects a $20 million benefit related to foreign exchange gains in 2014 versus losses in 2013, approximately $13 million of dividends from investments accounted for using the cost basis and the absence of the $16 million loss incurred in 2013 when we sold our investment in the nihon oxirane company.
2013 versus 2012the increase in other expense, net, in 2013 versus 2012 primarily reflects the $16 million loss we incurred on the sale of our investment in the nihon oxirane company.
2014 versus 2013our 2014 income from equity investments increased by $54 million over 2013. this improvement includes higher margins for some of our joint ventures in the middle east, europe and asia, the impact of better operating rates at two of our joint ventures in asia and one of our joint ventures in the middle east that experienced significant unplanned maintenance in 2013. in 2014, an improved supply of feedstock at one our asian joint ventures also contributed to the higher operating rates relative to 2013.
2013 versus 2012the $60 million increase in income from equity investments in 2013 reflected higher margins and improved operations from our joint ventures in the middle east and asia. these benefits were offset in part by a $10 million impairment of our noc asia ltd. joint venture. for additional information related to this impairment, see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. operations improved in 2013 at our al-waha petrochemicals ltd. (al-waha) joint venture as a result of turnaround activities there in 2012. results for 2012 were also negatively affected by planned maintenance activities at our hmc polymers company ltd. joint venture and unplanned outages at our al-waha joint venture.
income taxesour effective income tax rates of 27.0% in 2014, 22.7% in 2013 and 31.7% in 2012 resulted in tax provisions of $1,540 million, $1,136 million and $1,327 million, respectively. our effective income tax rate fluctuates based on, among other factors, changes in pretax income in countries with varying statutory tax rates, the amount of exempt income, the u.s. domestic production activity deduction, changes in valuation allowances, changes in foreign exchange gains/losses, and changes in unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions. the foreign exchange gains/losses have a permanent impact on our effective income tax rate that can cause unpredictable movement in our effective income tax rate. we continue to maintain valuation allowances in various jurisdictions totaling $134 million, which could impact our effective tax rate in the future.
2014the 2014 effective income tax rate, which was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate of 35%, was favorably impacted by the amount of exempt income, the u.s. domestic production activity deduction, foreign exchange losses and a change in the geographic mix of earnings, notably an increase in various european countries with lower statutory tax rates and a decrease in the united states pretax income. these favorable items were partially offset by the effects of state and local income taxes.
2013the 2013 effective income tax rate, which was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate of 35%, reflected the release of certain valuation allowances and favorable permanent deductions related to exempt income and the u.s. domestic production activity deduction, partially offset by the effects of state and local taxes and foreign exchange gains. in 2013, we released valuation allowances primarily associated with tax losses in our french tax group resulting in an overall benefit of $353 million.
2012the 2012 effective income tax rate, which was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate of 35%, reflected the release of certain valuation allowances and favorable permanent deductions related to exempt income and the u.s. domestic production activity deduction, partially offset by the effects of state and local taxes.
for further information related to our income taxes, see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
comprehensive incomewe had comprehensive income of $3,052 million in 2014, $4,364 million in 2013 and $2,864 million in 2012.
2014 versus 2013comprehensive income decreased by $1,312 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to foreign currency translation losses and actuarial losses related to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that were recognized during the period. these losses were offset in part by the increase in 2014 net income over 2013. the predominant functional currency for our operations outside of the u.s. is the euro. relative to the u.s. dollar, the value of the euro decreased in 2014 versus 2013, resulting in foreign currency translation losses, which decreased comprehensive income by $958 million. in 2014, we
recognized net actuarial losses of $493 million, which compares to a net actuarial gain of $411 million recognized in 2013. this $904 million decline in 2014 reflects $663 million related to discount rate assumption changes and other immaterial liability experience gains and losses and $241 million primarily related to actual asset return in excess of the expected return compared to 2013.
2013 versus 2012comprehensive income increased by $1,500 million in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to higher net income and lower actuarial losses related to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans and to a lesser extent, gains on foreign currency translations. in 2013, we recognized a net actuarial gain of $411 million, which compares to a net actuarial loss of $198 million recognized in 2012. this $609 million improvement in 2013 reflects $515 million related to discount rate assumption changes and other immaterial liability experience gains and losses and $94 million related to actual asset return in excess of the expected return compared to 2012. relative to the u.s. dollar, the value of the euro increased in 2013 versus 2012, resulting in higher foreign currency translation gains, which contributed $88 million to the increase in comprehensive income.
see critical accounting policies below and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the key assumptions included in calculating the discount rate and expected return on plan assets.
segment analysis we use earnings before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (ebitda) as our measure of profitability for segment reporting purposes. this measure of segment operating results is used by our chief operating decision maker to assess the performance of and allocate resources to our operating segments. intersegment eliminations and items that are not directly related or allocated to business operations are included in other. for additional information related to our operating segments, as well as a reconciliation of ebitda to its nearest generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) measure, income from continuing operations before income taxes, see note 22, segment and related information, to our consolidated financial statements.
our continuing operations are divided into five reportable segments: o&pamericas; o&peai; i&d; refining; and technology. the following tables reflect selected financial information for our reportable segments.
year ended december 31, millions of dollars                          2014                    2013                     2012
sales and other operating revenues:
olefins and polyolefinsamericas segment overviewin calculating the impact of margin and volume on ebitda, consistent with industry practice, management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene co-products against the cost to produce ethylene. volume and price impacts of ethylene co-products are reported in margin. ethylene is a major building block of our olefins and polyolefins businesses and as such management assesses the performance of the segment based on ethylene sales volumes and prices and our internal cost of ethylene production.
2014 versus 2013segment results were higher in 2014, primarily due to improved polyethylene and olefins results and, to a lesser extent, higher polypropylene margins. margin improvements and higher sales volumes in 2014 contributed to the increase in polyethylene results over 2013. our 2014 olefins results reflected higher margins relative to 2013, offset in part by lower sales volumes from the outage at our la porte, texas facility prior to the completion of an 800 million pound ethylene expansion in september 2014. our segment results were negatively impacted by a $279 million non-cash, lcm inventory valuation adjustment, most of which was recognized in the fourth quarter. absent this lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment, our fourth quarter 2014 segment results would have been similar to our strong third quarter 2014 results.
prices for heavy liquids, ngls and olefins declined significantly in december 2014, in many cases to levels that have not been seen in recent years. the price levels for these products were lower than the carrying value of our related inventories as of december 31, 2014 requiring us to record the lcm inventory valuation adjustment discussed above.
ethylene produced from ngls in north america has been much lower in cost than that produced from crude oil-based liquids. naphtha and other crude oil-based liquids are the predominant feedstocks in the rest of the world. margins in our olefins and polyethylene businesses in 2014, 2013 and 2012 have benefited from this advantage though that benefit may be diminished should the recent lower prices of naphtha and other crude-oil based liquids continue or decline further. in such an event, our olefins and polyethylene margins may be reduced from the record levels of 2014.
2013 versus 2012stronger segment earnings in 2013 primarily reflected improved olefins and polyethylene results over 2012. olefins results in 2013 benefited from a decrease in our cost to produce ethylene and from higher sales volumes. polyethylene results also improved on higher margins while polypropylene results declined on modestly lower margins.
ethylene raw materialsbenchmark crude oil and natural gas prices generally have been indicators of the level and direction of the movement of raw material and energy costs for ethylene and its co-products in the o&pamericas segment. ethylene and its co-products are produced from two major raw material groups:
   ngls, principally ethane and propane, the prices of which are generally affected by natural gas prices; and
   crude oil-based liquids (liquids or heavy liquids), including naphtha, condensates, and gas oils, the prices of which are generally related to crude oil prices.
although prices of these raw materials are generally related to crude oil and natural gas prices, during specific periods the relationships among these materials and benchmarks may vary significantly. in the u.s., we have significant capability to change the mix of raw materials used in the production of ethylene and its co-products to take advantage of the relative costs of heavy liquids and ngls.
production economics for the industry favored ngls during 2014, 2013 and 2012. as a result, we increased our use of ngls and reduced liquids consumption at our u.s. plants in each year since 2011. approximately 90% of our u.s. ethylene production was produced from ngls in each of 2014 and 2013 while in 2012, we produced approximately 85% of our ethylene from ngls.
the following table shows the average u.s. benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas for the applicable periods, as well as benchmark u.s. sales prices for ethylene and propylene, which we produce and sell or consume internally. the table also shows the discounted u.s. benchmark prices for certain polyethylene and polypropylene products. these industry benchmark prices are third party estimates that are indicative of contract sales for some key product grades, but do not necessarily describe price trends for our full olefins or polymers product mixes. the benchmark weighted average cost of ethylene production, which reflects credits for co-product sales, is based on a third party consultants estimated ratio of heavy liquid raw materials and ngls used in u.s. ethylene production.
average benchmark price and percent change versus prior year period average year ended                                                     year ended december 31,                                                   december 31,

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the o&pamericas segment including income from equity investments, which is a component of ebitda.
year ended december 31, millions of dollars                  2014                   2013                    2012
sales and other operating revenues           $13,948                 $13,089                 $12,934
2014 versus 2013the $859 million increase in revenues in 2014 is the result of higher average sales prices and higher sales volumes, which account for 6% and 1%, respectively, of the increase over 2013. average sales prices in 2014 were higher across most products, particularly polyethylene. higher average polyethylene prices in 2014 reflect increased demand and industry supply issues in the ethylene and polyethylene market. average polypropylene prices also improved in 2014, reflecting a market environment that was more favorable than in 2013.
the increase in sales volumes in 2014 was primarily due to higher polyethylene sales volumes offset in part by lower ethylene volumes. higher polyethylene sales volumes reflect the completion of an expansion-related turnaround at our matagorda, texas facility in the early part of 2014 and strong industry demand. firm market demand throughout 2014 also contributed to the increase in polyethylene sales volumes over 2013. ethylene volumes were negatively impacted by production constraints as a result of the turnaround at our la porte, texas facility during 2014. polypropylene sales volumes were relatively unchanged between the 2014 and 2013 periods.
2013 versus 2012in 2013, a 2% increase in revenues attributable to higher olefins sales volumes was partly offset by a 1% revenue decrease stemming from lower average sales prices. an increase in 2013 co-product sales volumes, particularly propylene and butadiene, more than offset the decline in ethylene volumes during that period. the decrease in 2013 revenues attributable to lower average sales prices primarily reflects lower average sales prices for ethylene and butadiene partly offset by higher average sales prices for polyolefins. polyethylene sales prices were higher in 2013, largely reflecting supply constraints due to competitor outages, while increases in the cost of propylene feedstock led to higher average sales prices for polypropylene.
2014 versus 2013the 9% improvement in ebitda during 2014 reflects a 19% increase related to higher margins which was offset in part by a 2% decrease related to volumes and an 8% decrease related to the $279 million lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment discussed above.
margins were higher across all products, especially for olefins and polyethylene. the combination of higher ethylene sales prices discussed above, the lower cost of ngls and heavy liquids, and higher co-product credits resulted in an improvement in olefins margins in 2014 compared to 2013. higher polyethylene margins in 2014 reflect higher average sales prices as discussed above offset in part by increases in ethylene feedstock costs. polypropylene margins also improved in 2014 due to the continued strength in pricing that carried over from late 2013.
the decrease in ebitda attributable to the lower volumes reflects a decline in olefins volumes which was partially offset by higher polyethylene volumes.
2013 versus 2012in 2013, the improvement in ebitda was primarily driven by a 25% increase related to margins. this benefit was offset in part by a 4% decrease associated with volumes and a 1% decrease related to a $29 million benefit in 2012 associated with a hurricane-related insurance settlement.
olefins margins benefited from the lower costs of ngl and heavy liquids feedstock, which more than offset the impact of lower average sales prices. higher polyethylene margins reflected higher average sales prices and to a lesser extent, lower feedstock costs. although average sales prices were significantly higher for polypropylene in 2013, this benefit was outpaced by the rising cost of its primary feedstock, propylene, resulting in modestly lower margins over 2012.
the decline in 2013 ebitda attributed to volumes was largely due to lower ethylene volumes in 2013 relative to 2012 as a result of increased turnaround activity in 2013.
2014 versus 2013operating results in 2014 reflect improved results for our olefins and european polyolefins businesses and, to a lesser extent, better results for our joint ventures that are accounted for using the equity method. higher margins and operating rates, which surpassed european average industry rates, contributed to the higher olefins results in 2014. the improvement in our polyolefins results in 2014 reflected improved margins versus 2013 and higher polyethylene volumes. although market conditions for european producers remain highly competitive, the increase in european demand for polyolefins is consistent with the modest overall economic recovery that has been evidenced in the region.
in the fourth quarter of 2014, the declining price of naphtha resulted in a market price lower than the carrying value of our related inventory. accordingly, we recorded a $44 million non-cash, lcm inventory valuation charge related to our olefins business. despite this charge, our fourth quarter results remained consistent with our prior quarterly results during 2014. the fall of our product prices lagged behind the decline in feedstock prices throughout the latter part of 2014.
2013 versus 2012although operating results improved in 2013 compared to 2012, market conditions in europe remained weak. operating results in 2013 primarily reflected higher results for european olefins and also reflected improved margins in most businesses relative to 2012. results during 2012 were impacted by a scheduled maintenance turnaround at our wesseling, germany plant.
ethylene raw materialsin europe, heavy liquids are the primary raw materials for our ethylene production. during 2014, we significantly increased the consumption of feedstocks other than naphtha, such as propane, butane and condensates, in our production process. the prices for these other feedstocks have been subject to declines that are of the same or greater magnitude as the declines in the crude oil prices.
the following table shows the average western europe benchmark prices for brent crude oil for the applicable periods, as well as benchmark western europe prices for ethylene and propylene, which we produce and consume internally or purchase from unrelated suppliers, and discounted prices for certain polyethylene and polypropylene products. these industry benchmark prices are third party estimates that are indicative of contract sales for some key product grades, but do not necessarily describe price trends for our full olefins or polymers product mixes.

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the o&peai segment including income from equity investments, which is a component of ebitda.
year ended december 31, millions of dollars                  2014                   2013                  2012
sales and other operating revenues           $15,203               $14,685               $14,521
2014 versus 2013the increase in 2014 revenues comprises a 2% increase related to higher sales volumes and a 2% increase from higher average sales prices. improved operations of our crackers in 2014 versus 2013 resulted in higher output, which led to higher olefins sales volumes. higher polyethylene sales volumes reflect an increase in our low density polyethylene production capacity relative to 2013 due to operational issues during that time. polypropylene sales volumes were lower in 2014 largely due to lower output as a result of turnaround activities at one of our joint ventures during the first quarter of 2014 and the closure of our clyde production facility in australia in late 2013.
in 2014, higher average prices for polypropylene and pp compounds were partially offset by lower average polyethylene prices. increases in feedstock costs in 2014 led to the higher polypropylene and pp compounds sales prices compared to 2013. the lower polyethylene prices in 2014 reflect a decline in ethylene feedstock costs, primarily in europe.
2013 versus 2012in 2013, a 2% increase in revenues driven by the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange was partially offset by a 1% decrease stemming from lower average sales prices. the decrease in average sales prices was largely attributable to lower sales prices for olefins. these prices are generally correlated with the cost of naphtha, which decreased during 2013 compared to 2012. sales volumes in 2013 decreased less than 1% from 2012, as a small decrease in olefins volumes was substantially offset by a similar increase in polypropylene sales volumes.
2014 versus 2013the 63% improvement in 2014 ebitda included a 51% increase related to margins, a 7% increase related to higher volumes and a 7% increase related to improvements in income from our equity investments. these increases were partially offset by a 2% decrease related to a net charge of $17 million discussed below. in 2014, ebitda included a $52 million benefit associated with a settlement for certain existing and future environmental claims under a 2005 indemnification agreement from an insurance settlement, which was offset in part by a $44 million charge related to an lcm adjustment driven by a decline in naphtha prices. in 2013, ebitda included a $25 million benefit from an insurance settlement related to the damage to our ldpe plant described below.
the increase in 2014 results was mainly driven by higher earnings in olefins and european polyolefins compared to 2013. higher olefins results reflect margin improvements and the impact of higher volumes discussed above. olefin margins were higher primarily due to the combination of the decline in naphtha feedstock prices during the second half of 2014, higher consumption of advantaged feedstocks and increased propylene sales prices driven by tightness in the european market. polyethylene results improved during 2014 on higher sales volume, as discussed above, and on higher spreads, primarily due to lower ethylene feedstock costs. polypropylene results increased in 2014 over the corresponding prior year period as the margin improvements from higher spreads more than offset the impact of the lower volumes discussed above.
the higher contribution to our results by certain of our joint ventures, which is reflected in income from equity investments in 2014, is mainly driven by improved margins compared to 2013 as a result of favorable market price developments during 2014.
2013 versus 2012the 53% improvement in 2013 ebitda mainly consists of a 28% increase related to margins, a 10% improvement related to equity income and a $76 million, or 14%, net benefit of one-time items in 2013 versus 2012 discussed below. the impact on ebitda from the volume change in 2013 versus 2012 was negligible. in 2013, ebitda included a $25 million benefit from an insurance settlement related to the damage to our ldpe plant described below. in 2012, ebitda included charges of $35 million for restructuring activities in europe, $22 million for closure costs in australia and italy and $22 million for impairment of assets related to the damage of our ldpe plant in wesseling, germany. these 2012 charges were partially offset by a $28 million benefit in 2012 related to the reversal of a reserve for an unfavorable monomer contract.
the increase in 2013 segment results was driven mainly by higher olefins results. the higher olefins results reflect higher margins as lower naphtha feedstock costs and the benefit of processing advantaged feedstock during the summer months more than offset lower average sales prices during the period. in addition, olefins sales price increases in 2012 lagged steep naphtha feedstock cost increases for several months.
excluding the impact of the one-time items discussed above, underlying results for polyolefins reflected higher polyethylene margins and an increase in polypropylene volumes. pp compounds margins, which reflected higher sales prices coupled with decreases in the costs of its key raw material, propylene, also improved in 2013 relative to 2012. higher margins due to higher average sale prices contributed to the better polybutene-1 results in 2013 compared to 2012.
the higher contribution to our 2013 results by certain of our joint ventures is largely due to higher margins and improved operations of our joint ventures in the middle east and asia.
2014 versus 2013operating results for our i&d segment were slightly lower in 2014 compared to 2013 due to a $93 million non-cash, lcm inventory valuation adjustment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014. this adjustment was a result of the decline of prices for oxyfuels and the raw materials used to produce oxyfuels that fell to levels that were lower than the carrying value of our related inventories at december 31, 2014.
absent this inventory valuation adjustment, results reflected improvements in acetyls and po and derivatives that were offset in part by lower results for styrene, eo/eg, oxyfuels and c4 chemicals. higher acetyls results were primarily driven by the restart of the channelview, texas methanol unit in december 2013. industry outages and the delay of announced capacity additions contributed to the higher po and derivatives results in 2014. lower results for styrene in 2014 were driven by excess supply and higher feedstock prices compared to 2013. unplanned maintenance in the last half of the year contributed to our lower eo/eg results in 2014. the decrease in oxyfuels and c4 chemicals results reflected the impact of lower oxyfuels sales volumes that was partially offset by slightly higher margins.
2013 versus 2012our i&d operating results for 2013 were lower relative to 2012, mainly due to a decline in oxyfuels results from the exceptionally strong results reported in 2012. additions to bdo industry capacity and raw material increases during 2013 contributed to a decline in our po derivative results. improved results for styrene, acetyls and eo/eg in 2013 were driven by higher margins as compared to 2012. results were also negatively impacted during the 2013 period by scheduled maintenance at our facilities in the u.s. and europe.
the following table sets forth selected financial information for the i&d segment including income from equity investments, which is a component of ebitda. in addition, the table shows methyl tertiary butyl ether (mtbe) margins in northwest europe (nwe).

higher sales volumes for acetyls, styrene and po were offset in part by lower eo and derivatives and oxyfuels sales volumes. the 2014 increase in acetyls sales volumes was primarily driven by the december 2013 restart of our methanol plant in channelview, texas. sales volumes for styrene were higher in 2014 as volumes in 2013 were negatively impacted by planned plant outages at our channelview, texas and maasvlakte, the netherlands facilities, which limited production capacity during that period. po sales volumes were higher largely due to industry outages in asia and europe in 2014. due to unplanned outages at our bayport, texas facility in 2014, available production capacity was limited, which resulted in lower eo derivatives volumes compared to 2013. planned and unplanned production constraints in 2014 were also responsible for lower oxyfuels volumes compared to 2013.
in 2014, higher average sales prices for po and derivatives and vam were partially offset by declines in the average sales prices for oxyfuels and c4 chemicals in 2014 compared to 2013. global industry supply constraints and limited regional supply capacity led to higher prices for po and derivatives as well as vam in 2014 compared 2013. oxyfuels sales prices declined in 2014 relative to 2013 with lower brent crude oil and gasoline prices, which were partially mitigated by an increase in the octane blend premium. octane blend premiums remained strong in 2014, primarily due to industry supply constraints and regionally strong blending demand.
2013 versus 2012a 4% decrease in revenues in 2013 stemming from lower sales volumes was offset in part by increases in revenue of 1% due to higher average sales prices and 1% from favorable average foreign exchange impacts. in 2013, lower sales volumes for po and derivatives and styrene were partially offset by higher oxyfuels and methanol sales volumes, compared to 2012. an oversupplied market, which more than offset the benefit from nominal demand growth, contributed to lower bdo sales volumes in 2013 compared to 2012. turnaround activities in 2013 led to lower styrene volumes during that period. improved south american demand resulted in higher oxyfuels sales volumes relative to 2012. the increase in methanol sales volumes was attributable to the restart in december 2013 of our channelview, texas, methanol plant, which had been idled since 2004.
higher average sales prices in 2013 increased revenues by 1% compared to 2012. average sales prices for po increased in 2013 largely due to increases in the price of propylene. supply constraints due to industry outages resulted in higher average sales prices for styrene in 2013 compared to 2012. higher demand for methanol due to supply constraints in the middle east and asia coupled with supply constraints for vam in europe, led to increases in acetyls sales prices in 2013 over those seen in 2012. these increases were substantially offset by declines in oxyfuels and bdo sales prices. oxyfuels sales prices decreased in 2013, reflecting reduced spreads over gasoline relative to a supply-constrained market in 2012, as well as lower gasoline prices and reduced gasoline spread over butane. bdo sales prices also declined due to weak economic conditions and an oversupplied asian market.
2014 versus 2013ebitda decreased in 2014 as a result of the $93 million lcm inventory valuation adjustment in 2014 related to our oxyfuels business, which represented a 6% decrease in ebitda compared to 2013. the impact of this charge was offset in part by a 2% increase in ebitda related to 2013 charges totaling $26 million associated with the sale of our investment in nihon oxirane company discussed below. in addition to these items, a 10% increase in ebitda related to higher volumes was offset in part by a decrease of 8% related to lower margins.
apart from the one-time items discussed above, our 2014 results reflected improvements in po and derivatives and acetyls, partially offset by lower results for oxyfuels, c4 chemicals, styrene and eo/eg compared to 2013.
improved po and derivatives results for 2014 benefitted from asian start-up delays, industry outages and european industry supply interruptions. these global factors collectively led to higher po sales volumes and increases in average sales prices in 2014 compared to 2013. in addition, po and derivatives, particularly propylene glycols, benefited from the unusually cold weather in early 2014 compared to 2013.
higher acetyls results in 2014 primarily reflect higher methanol volumes due to the restart of our methanol plant in channelview, texas in december 2013 combined with improved vam driven by industry outages and a reduction in overall market supply compared to 2013. although operational issues during 2014 limited the benefit derived from the restart of our methanol plant discussed above, the plant added approximately 180 million gallons to the overall results during that period. improved vam margins in 2014, as increases in average sales prices were partly offset by higher feedstock costs, also contributed to the higher acetyls results compared to 2013.
the lower oxyfuels results were primarily due to decreases in sales volumes in 2014 as a result of planned and unplanned outages discussed above. margins improved moderately in 2014 compared to 2013 as lower brent crude oil and gasoline prices were more than offset by the improved spread between gasoline and crude oil, stronger octane blend premiums and lower feedstock prices. margins were also negatively impacted by a shift in the level of sales between regions; in addition, c4 chemicals results declined on falling energy prices.
the decline in styrene results in 2014 compared to 2013 was attributed to lower margins that were partially offset by the impact of the higher sales volumes discussed above. styrene margins decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower average sales prices, reflecting weak demand and excess capacity, and higher benzene and ethylene feedstock prices.
2013 versus 2012the 8% decline in ebitda in 2013 reflected decreases of 5% related to margins, the $44 million, or 3%, net negative impact of the one-time charges in 2013 versus 2012 and a slight decline in volumes.
in 2013, ebitda included a $16 million charge related to the sale of our 40% interest in nihon oxirane company and a $10 million impairment of our investment in our noc asia ltd joint venture. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the sale and impairment of our interests in these joint ventures. in 2012, ebitda included an $18 million benefit related to hurricane-related insurance settlement.
lower results for oxyfuels and po derivatives were offset in part by higher styrene, acetyls and eo/eg margins. oxyfuels results in 2013 reflected lower margins relative to the exceptionally strong margins in 2012. reduced spreads over gasoline relative to a supply-constrained market in 2012, as well as lower gasoline prices and a reduced gasoline spread over butane contributed to the decrease in oxyfuels margins in 2013. results for po derivatives declined in 2013 primarily due to lower bdo and solvents results. an oversupplied asian market, which more than offset nominal demand growth, resulted in lower sales volumes and weaker margins for bdo in 2013 compared to 2012.
these decreases were partially offset by improved styrene margins due to industry outages which constrained global supply and led to increases in average sales prices in 2013, which outpaced the higher costs of benzene feedstock. the improvement in acetyls results reflected the benefit of the restart of our channelview, texas methanol plant. higher average sales prices and the lower cost of ethylene feedstock, the benefits of which were partly offset by higher natural gas costs, also contributed to the increase in acetyls results. higher margins for eo/eg in 2013 reflected a modest increase in average sales prices and lower ethylene feedstock costs.
refining segment overviewthe refining segment comprises the operations of our full conversion refinery located on the houston ship channel in houston, texas. the berre refinery, which was previously included in the refining segment through the first quarter of 2012, was classified as discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2012. accordingly, results of operations for the berre refinery are not included in the segment discussion.
2014 versus 2013the results of our refining segment in 2014 were significantly impacted by a year-end, non-cash charge of $344 million to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to market value at december 31, 2014. this inventory valuation charge was predicated on a near $50 per barrel decline in crude oil prices since the third quarter of 2014 and corresponding reductions in refined product prices.
fourth quarter 2014 results were markedly lower than results in the prior three quarters of 2014 as refined product margins contracted, and the recognition of the lcm inventory valuation adjustment resulted in a loss for the quarter. excluding this charge, 2014 segment ebitda reflected an increase over 2013 as refining margins improved, operating rates were higher, and costs for rins, a u.s. government established credit used to show compliance in meeting the environmental protection agencys renewable fuel standard, declined by $20 million.
2013 versus 2012lower refining margins in 2013 compared to 2012 reflected decreases in the average differential between light and heavy crude oils, lower by-product values and $87 million of higher costs for rins. operating results were unfavorably impacted by lower crude processing rates, largely due to turnaround activities. operational issues related to our coking units in december 2013 caused a decline in crude processing rates and suboptimal yields in the fourth quarter of 2013, negatively impacting results in 2013. as indicated in our discussion of operating activities included in financial condition, purchases of intermediate feedstocks for our fluid catalytic cracking unit in december 2013 to replace the feedstocks normally provided by our coking units resulted in a temporary increase in accounts payable as of december 31, 2013.
the following table sets forth selected financial information and heavy crude processing rates for the refining segment and the u.s. refining market margins for the applicable periods. lls is a light crude oil, while maya is a heavy crude oil.

market margins, dollars per barrel light crude oil2-1-1                                                   $13.32                $12.89                $12.86
revenuesrevenues were nearly unchanged in 2014 compared to 2013 and decreased by $1,593 million, or 12%, in 2013 compared to 2012.
2014 versus 2013total revenues increased $12 million on increased sales volume, which were nearly offset by lower product prices. sales volumes increased 8% in 2014 relative to 2013 on the benefit of near capacity crude processing rates during most of the year. processing rates in 2014 reflect an 12% improvement over rates in 2013, which were negatively impacted by planned and unplanned maintenance. this increase was offset by a nearly 8% decrease in revenues driven by lower refined product prices attributable to lower crude oil prices in 2014.
2013 versus 2012lower sales volumes in 2013 contributed 9% to the revenue decrease over 2012. this decrease in sales volumes corresponded to a 9% decrease in 2013 crude processing rates, mainly due to a scheduled turnaround during the first quarter of 2013 and unplanned maintenance during the year. in 2013, the increased supply of refined products relative to demand is reflected in a 3% decrease in revenues attributable to lower average refined product sales prices.
2014 versus 2013the $344 million lcm inventory valuation adjustment in 2014 represented a 189% decrease in ebitda during the period. ebitda was lower in 2014 relative to 2013 by an additional 7% due to a $14 million one-time recovery and settlement in 2013 discussed below. in addition to these items, our results reflected higher refining margins and higher volumes in 2014, which resulted in increases in ebitda of 98% and 34%, respectively.
refinery crude oil processing rates in 2014 were maintained near capacity with the exception of rates in the first quarter of 2014. processing rates in the first quarter of 2014 were negatively impacted by temporary reductions in coking capacity due to the repair of equipment necessitated by operational issues experienced in december 2013. planned repairs on a process vessel in april 2014 also resulted in reduced crude processing during that time.
2013 versus 2012the 62% decline in ebitda in 2013 reflected decreases of 33% related to margins, 16% related to volumes and the $63 million, or 13%, net negative impact of the following one-time items that occurred in 2013 and 2012. in 2013, ebitda included benefits of $14 million related to recoveries and a settlement associated with a former employee who pled guilty to fraud. in 2012, ebitda reflected the benefits of a $53 million insurance settlement associated with a hurricane in 2008 and a recovery of $24 million related to the employee fraud matter discussed above.
our refining margins in 2013, which were lower relative to 2012, were impacted by decreases in the average differential between light and heavy crude oils. lower by-product values and higher natural gas and rins costs also negatively impacted our margins in 2013.
crude oil costs at the refinery in 2013 relative to 2012 reflected increased purchases priced in relation to wti and brent crude oils and a lesser amount priced relative to maya, which reduced the comparability of our refined product spreads with the maya benchmark product spread.
the lower volumes in 2013 were attributable to the lower crude processing rates stemming from the turnaround activity in the first quarter of 2013 as well as unscheduled maintenance during the year.
technology segment overviewthe technology segment recognizes revenues related to the sale of polyolefin catalysts, licensing of chemical, polyolefin and other process technologies and associated engineering and other services. these revenues are offset in part by the costs incurred in the production of catalysts, licensing and services activities and in research and development (r&d) activities. in 2014, our technology segment incurred approximately 65% of all r&d costs while in the corresponding periods of 2013 and 2012, it incurred approximately 70% of our r&d costs.
2014 versus 2013operating results in 2014 were unchanged compared to 2013, reflecting lower r&d expenses and, to a lesser extent, higher catalyst results, offset by lower licensing and services revenues.
2013 versus 2012improved operating results in 2013 compared to 2012 reflected higher licensing and services revenues and lower r&d expenses. technology segment results for 2012 included an $18 million charge related to restructuring activities in europe during that period.
the following table sets forth selected financial information for the technology segment.
year ended december 31, millions of dollars                  2014               2013                2012
sales and other operating revenues          $497                $532                $498
2014 versus 2013lower licensing and services revenues contributed 7% to the decrease in revenues in 2014 compared to 2013, which benefited from the one-time, lump-sum settlement associated with a process license agreement discussed below. higher average catalyst sales prices increased revenues by 1% in 2014 while catalyst sales volumes reflected a corresponding decrease compared to the prior year period.
2013 versus 2012higher licensing and services revenues primarily due to a one-time, lump-sum settlement in 2013 associated with a process license agreement entered into in a prior year contributed 7% to the increase in 2013 revenues over 2012. lower catalyst sales volumes decreased revenues by 2%, while average catalyst sales prices in 2013 remained relatively unchanged from 2012. favorable foreign exchange rates contributed the remaining 2% increase in 2013 revenues.
2014 versus 2013ebitda in 2014 reflects lower r&d expenses and moderately higher catalyst results, offset by lower licensing and services revenues as discussed above. the improvement in 2014 catalyst results over 2013 was the result of higher margins due to higher average sales prices and lower cost.
2013 versus 2012the improvement in ebitda in 2013 reflects higher licensing and services revenues discussed above and lower r&d costs compared to 2012. in 2012, segment results included an $18 million charge related to r&d restructuring activities in europe.
financial condition operating, investing and financing activities of continuing operations, which are discussed below, are presented in the following table:
year ended december 31, millions of dollars     2014                    2013                     2012

operating activitiescash of $6,048 million provided in 2014 primarily reflected earnings, adjusted for non-cash items, distributions from our joint ventures and refunds totaling $232 million for value added taxes (vat) related to prior periods that were received from italian tax authorities in 2014. these cash inflows were offset in part by cash used by the main components of working capitalaccounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable.
the main components of working capital used cash of $225 million in 2014. total cash used by the $205 million increase in inventories and by the $378 million decrease in accounts payable was offset in part by a $358 million decline in accounts receivable. the increase in inventories primarily reflects higher olefins raw material inventories, which were offset in part by lower ethylene and propylene inventories due to turnaround activities at our la porte, texas facility, and higher levels of inventory for crude oil and work-in-process in our refining segment. accounts payable decreased due to lower feedstock costs in 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease in accounts receivable primarily reflects lower ethylene prices in our o&peai segment, lower oxyfuels prices in our i&d segment, lower average sales prices and year end volumes in north american polyolefins and lower prices for refining products. also contributing to the decline was a larger than usual accounts receivable balance at the end of 2013 attributable to customer remittance timing.
cash of $4,835 million provided in 2013 primarily reflected earnings, adjusted for non-cash items, proceeds received from italian tax authorities for refunds of vat from prior periods, distributions from our joint ventures, insurance settlements and cash provided by the main components of working capital. these increases were offset in part by company contributions to our pension plans.
the main components of working capital provided cash of $60 million in 2013. this reflected increases of $64 million, $151 million and $275 million in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable, respectively. the increase in inventories was attributable to a build in our o&pamericas polyethylene inventory at the end of 2013 in preparation for a turnaround scheduled during the first half of 2014 at our la porte, texas facility and an increase in crude inventory levels over 2012 levels. these increases were partially offset by decreases in our i&d segment inventories. the increase in accounts receivable reflected higher year end o&pamericas and i&d segment sales volumes in 2013 compared to 2012. a temporary increase in the purchase of intermediate feedstocks due to operating issues at the houston refinery at the end of 2013 and an increase in payment terms for crude oil purchases in our refining segment were the primary drivers for the increase in accounts payable.
cash of $4,787 million provided in 2012 primarily reflected earnings, adjusted for non-cash items, proceeds of $306 million received from income tax refunds, distributions from our joint ventures, insurance settlements and cash provided by the main components of working capital. these increases were offset in part by company contributions to our pension plans and premiums and other fees related to prepayment of debt.
the main components of working capital provided cash of $151 million in 2012. this reflected a decrease in inventories of $441 million, partially offset by a $101 million increase in accounts receivable and a $189 million decrease in accounts payable. a reduction in the high level of our o&pamericas olefins inventories that were built at the end of 2011 in preparation for a turnaround scheduled for early july 2012 at our channelview, texas facility and the liquidation of refined products and crude oil inventories following the january 2012 shutdown of our berre refinery were the primary contributors to the $441 million decrease in inventories. the increase in accounts receivable reflected higher sales volumes at the end of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, while the lower accounts payable at december 31, 2012 reflected lower outstanding crude oil invoices compared to december 31, 2011.
investing activitieswe used cash of $3,531 million, $1,602 million and $1,013 million in investing activities in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
in 2014, we invested cash in investment-grade and other high-quality financial instruments that provide flexibility to redeploy funds as needed to meet our cash flow requirements while maximizing yield. we invested $3,439 million in securities deemed available-for-sale and classified as short-term investments, and $425 million in tri-party repurchase agreements classified as short-term loans receivable. in 2014, we also received proceeds of $1,751 million and $75 million, respectively, upon the maturity of certain of our available-for-sale securities and repurchase agreements. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these investments.
the following table summarizes our capital expenditures plan for 2015 and actual capital expenditures for our continuing operations for the periods from 2012 through 2014:
millions of dollars                                                   2014             2013                  2012
capital expenditures by segment:
consolidated capital expenditures of continuing operations      $1,562          $1,499                $1,561                $1,060
capital spending projected for 2015 is expected to increase over 2014 levels. the largest increases are projected for our i&d and refining segments and include turnaround activities and environmental-related matters. we have also projected modest increases in 2015 capital spending for our o&peai segment. this increased level of spending is offset in part by lower projected spending in 2015 for our o&pamericas segment as compared to 2014.
completion of the ethylene expansion and associated turnaround at our la porte, texas facility, a debottleneck at our corpus christi, texas facility and the installation of new furnaces at our channelview, texas facility are reflected in the increase in 2014 capital spending for the o&pamericas segment relative to 2013. this increase was offset in part by reduced capital spending for our i&d, refining and o&peai segments in 2014 relative to 2013 due primarily to the completion in 2013 of the restart of our methanol plant in channelview, texas, a major turnaround at our houston, texas refinery, and a butadiene expansion project in wesseling, germany, respectively.
the higher levels of capital spending for our i&d and o&pamericas segments in 2013 relative to 2012 were primarily related to the methanol plant restart in channelview, texas, and the ethylene expansion project at our la porte, texas, facility, respectively.
financing activitiesfinancing activities used cash of $5,907 million, $1,589 million and $2,145 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
we made payments totaling $5,788 million and $1,949 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, to acquire a portion of our outstanding ordinary shares. we also made dividend payments totaling $1,403 million, $1,127 million and $2,415 million to our shareholders in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the dividend payments in 2012 included a special dividend of $2.75 per share paid on december 11, 2012 to shareholders of record on november 19, 2012. for additional information related to these share repurchases and dividend payments, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
in october 2014, we entered into a new commercial paper program. we received net proceeds of $262 million through the issuance and repurchase of commercial paper instruments under this program during 2014. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and the discussion of liquidity and capital resources below for additional information related to our new commercial paper program.
in february 2014, we issued $1,000 million of 4.875% notes due 2044 and received net proceeds of $988 million.
in july 2013, we received net proceeds totaling $1,468 million from the issuance of $750 million of 4% guaranteed notes due 2023 and $750 million of 5.25% guaranteed notes due 2043, and paid fees totaling $23 million.
we also received $3,000 million of proceeds in 2012 from the issuance of $2,000 million of 5% senior notes due 2019 and $1,000 million of 5.75% senior notes due 2024. net proceeds from the notes, together with cash on hand, were used to finance the repayment in full of the remaining $2,676 million of previously outstanding notes and to pay $294 million for associated premiums and fees, which are reflected in operating cash flows.
in may 2012, we entered into a five-year revolving credit facility, and terminated our asset-based credit facility. as discussed in liquidity and capital resources below, we amended and restated this credit facility in june 2014. the revolving credit facility may be used for dollar and euro denominated borrowings and includes a sublimit for up to $700 million of dollar and euro denominated letters of credit. the balance of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the facility may not exceed $2,000 million at any given time.
in september 2012, we entered into a three-year, $1,000 million u.s. accounts receivable securitization facility that permits the sale of certain eligible trade receivables to participating financial institutions. the facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to $200 million.
for additional information related to these financing activities, see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
liquidity and capital resourcesas of december 31, 2014, we had $2,624 million unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities classified as short-term investments. for additional information related to our purchases of marketable securities, which currently include certificates of deposit, commercial paper and bonds, see the investing activities section above and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
at december 31, 2014, we had $433 million of cash in jurisdictions outside the u.s., principally in the united kingdom. approximately 3% of our outstanding cash balance is held in a country that has established government imposed currency restrictions that could impede the ability of our subsidiary to transfer funds to us. there are currently no other material or legal or economic restrictions that would impede our transfers of cash.
we also had total unused availability under our credit facilities of $3,253 million at december 31, 2014, which included the following:
                                                   $1,712 million under our $2,000 million revolving credit facility, which backs our $2,000 million commercial paper program. availability under this facility is net of outstanding borrowings, outstanding letters of credit provided under the facility and notes issued under our $2,000 million commercial paper program. at december 31, 2014, we had $262 million of outstanding commercial paper, no outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings under the facility.
                    $994 million under our $1,000 million u.s. accounts receivable securitization facility. availability under this facility is subject to a borrowing base of eligible receivables, which is reduced by outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, if any. this facility had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit at december 31, 2014.
                                                440 million and $13 million (totaling approximately $547 million) under our 450 million european receivables securitization facility. availability under this facility is subject to a borrowing base, net of outstanding borrowings. there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility at december 31, 2014.
see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our credit facilities.
we also have outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling $688 million at december 31, 2014 issued under uncommitted credit facilities.
at december 31, 2014, we had total debt, including current maturities, of $7,107 million.
in accordance with our current interest rate risk management strategy and subject to managements evaluation of market conditions and the availability of favorable interest rates among other factors, we may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to economically convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to variable rate debt or convert a portion of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt.
we entered into u.s. dollar interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of $2,000 million during 2014 as part of our current interest rate risk management strategy to achieve a desired proportion of variable
versus fixed rate debt. the swaps, which have been designated as fair value hedges, effectively convert our $2,000 million 5% senior notes due 2019 to floating debt based on 3 month usd libor. for additional information related to these swaps, see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
in october 2014, we entered into a commercial paper program under which we may issue up to $2,000 million of privately placed, unsecured short-term promissory notes (commercial paper). this program is backed by our $2,000 million senior revolving credit facility. proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper may be used for general corporate purposes, including dividend payments and share repurchases. at december 31, 2014, we had $262 million of commercial paper outstanding.
in june 2014, we amended and restated our $2,000 million revolving credit facility to, among other things, reduce undrawn pricing and extend the term of the facility to june 2019.
in february 2014, our direct, 100% owned subsidiary, lyb international finance b.v., issued $1,000 million of 4.875% notes due 2044 at a discounted price of 98.831%. proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our ordinary shares. interest payments under these notes commenced on september 15, 2014. these unsecured notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by lyondellbasell industries n.v., rank equally in right of payment to all of lyb international finance b.v.s existing and future unsecured indebtedness and to all of lyondellbasells existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness. the notes may be redeemed before the date that is six months prior to the scheduled maturity date at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed and the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (discounted at the applicable treasury yield plus 20 basis points) on the notes to be redeemed. the notes may also be redeemed on or after the date that is six months prior to the final maturity date of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest.
on july 16, 2013, our direct, 100% owned subsidiary, lyb international finance b.v., issued $750 million of 4% notes due 2023 and $750 million of 5.25% notes due 2043 at discounted prices of 98.678% and 97.004%, respectively. proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our ordinary shares. interest payments under these notes commenced on january 15, 2014. these unsecured notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by lyondellbasell industries n.v., rank equally in right of payment to all of lyb international finance b.v.s existing and future unsecured indebtedness and to all of lyondellbasells existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness. these notes may be redeemed or repaid at any time and from time to time prior to maturity at an amount equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed and repaid, and the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis at the applicable treasury yield plus 25 basis points in the case of the 4% notes due 2023 and plus 30 basis points in the case of the 5.25% notes due 2043.
in april 2013, we amended and restated our 450 million european receivables securitization facility to obtain more favorable terms and conditions, including reduced pricing, and to extend the maturity date of the facility to april 2016.
for additional information related to our credit facilities and notes discussed above, see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
during the second quarter of 2014, we concluded our share repurchase program announced in may 2013 under which we could repurchase up to 10% of our shares outstanding. we purchased 57,584,238 shares under this program for approximately $4,678 million.
in april 2014, we announced a new share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to 10% of our shares outstanding over the next eighteen months for a total of approximately 53 million shares. our share repurchase program does not have a stated dollar amount, and purchases may be made through open market
purchases, private market transactions or other structured transactions. repurchased shares could be retired or used for general corporate purposes, including for various employee benefit and compensation plans. as of december 31, 2014, we have purchased 33 million shares under this program for approximately $3,143 million. as of february 13, 2015, we had approximately 10 million shares remaining under the current authorization. the timing and amount of additional shares repurchased will be determined by our management board based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. for additional information related to our share repurchase programs, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
as a result of ceasing operations at our berre refinery in france in january 2012, we expect to make future payments to severed employees and for exit and disposal activities. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this matter.
we may repay or redeem our debt, including purchases of our outstanding bonds in the open market, using cash on hand, cash from operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of debt, proceeds from asset divestitures, or a combination thereof. we plan to fund our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other funding requirements with cash from operations, which could be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. cash on hand, cash from operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of debt, or a combination thereof, may be used to fund the repurchase of shares under our share repurchase program.
we intend to continue to declare and pay quarterly dividends, with the goal of increasing the dividend over time, after giving consideration to our cash balances and expected results from operations.
we believe that our cash on hand, cash from operating activities and proceeds from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due.
contractual and other obligationsthe following table summarizes, as of december 31, 2014, our minimum payments for long-term debt, including current maturities, short-term debt, and contractual and other obligations for the next five years and thereafter:
total                                                                                                              payments due by period millions of dollars                   2015              2016                  2017                  2018                  2019                thereafter total debt                      $7,157              $350                    $5                    $1                    $                $2,000                    $4,801
advances from customers            142                73                    25                    22                     6                     3                        13
operating leases                 1,805               333                   271                   236                   207                   142                       616
total debtour debt includes unsecured senior notes, guaranteed notes and various other u.s. and non-u.s. loans. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of covenant requirements under the credit facilities and indentures and additional information regarding our debt facilities.
interest on total debtour debt and related party debt agreements contain provisions for the payment of monthly, quarterly or semi-annual interest at a stated rate of interest over the term of the debt.
pension and other postretirement benefitswe maintain several defined benefit pension plans, as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. many of our u.s. and non-u.s. plans are subject to minimum funding requirements; however, the amounts of required future contributions for all our plans are not fixed and can vary significantly due to changes in economic assumptions, liability experience and investment return on plan assets. as a result, we have excluded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations from the contractual and other obligations table above. our annual contributions may include amounts in excess of minimum required funding levels. contributions to our non-u.s. plans in years beyond 2015 are not expected to be materially different than the expected 2015 contributions disclosed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. at december 31, 2014, the projected benefit obligation for our pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $953 million. subject to future actuarial gains and losses, as well as actual asset earnings, we, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, will be required to fund the $953 million, with interest, in future years. we contributed $94 million, $172 million and $180 million to our pension plans in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. we provide other postretirement benefits, primarily medical benefits to eligible participants, as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. we pay other unfunded postretirement benefits as incurred.
advances from customerswe are obligated to deliver products in connection with long-term sales agreements under which advances from customers were received in prior years. these advances are treated as deferred revenue and will be amortized to earnings as product is delivered over the remaining terms of the respective contracts, which range predominantly from 4 to 8 years. the unamortized long-term portion of such advances totaled $69 million as of december 31, 2014.
otherother primarily consists of accruals for environmental remediation costs, obligations under deferred compensation arrangements, and anticipated asset retirement obligations. see critical accounting policies below for a discussion of obligations for environmental remediation costs.
deferred income taxesthe scheduled settlement of the deferred tax liabilities shown in the table is based on the scheduled reversal of the underlying temporary differences. actual cash tax payments will vary depending upon future taxable income. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our deferred tax liabilities.
purchase obligationswe are party to various obligations to purchase products and services, principally for raw materials, utilities and industrial gases. these commitments are designed to assure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements. the commitments are segregated into take-or-pay contracts and other contracts. under the take-or-pay contracts, we are obligated to make minimum payments whether or not we take the product or service. other contracts include contracts that specify minimum quantities; however, in the event that we do not take the contractual minimum, we are only obligated for any resulting economic loss suffered by the vendor. the payments shown for the other contracts assume that minimum quantities are purchased. for contracts with variable pricing terms, the minimum payments reflect the contract price at december 31, 2014.
operating leaseswe lease various facilities and equipment under noncancelable lease arrangements for various periods. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for related lease disclosures.
current business outlook our raw material and product prices continue to be impacted by the substantial decline in energy prices over the past few months. the u.s. ngl advantage enjoyed by our olefins and polymers businesses has been reduced with the decline of global naphtha feedstock prices. this reduction has been partially mitigated by lower u.s. natural gas and ngl prices. there remains uncertainty about the future path and economic impact of energy prices and the resulting impact on global demand for our products.
although margins for our north america olefins and polymers will likely be lower than the 2014 levels due to a reduced ngl advantage and increased supplies associated with easing of industry capacity restrictions, we continue to expect margins in 2015 to reflect an ngl advantage. we also expect our european olefins margins to decline from high fourth quarter 2014 levels, which were primarily related to feedstock price reductions that outpaced those for product prices. benefits from significant volumes of advantaged feedstocks and improved product competitiveness with a weaker euro and lower feedstock costs should support eu performance.
our i&d segment should continue to benefit from extended competitor outages in the po chain and low feedstock costs in 2015. the refining business has experienced a margin reduction as a result of the oil and refined product price declines, which is being partly offset by higher volumes of advantaged north american crude oil as pipeline supplies increase.
a continued and sustained decline in crude oil prices and the resulting impact on downstream product prices may result in additional lcm inventory valuation adjustments in all but our technology segment during the first quarter of 2015.
while we believe most of our growth projects that are currently in progress will be advantageous, we are reevaluating future capital plans related to our new gulf coast polyethylene facility, based on the changes in energy prices and rising construction costs in the gulf coast.
related party transactions we have related party transactions with certain of our major shareholders and their affiliates and our joint venture partners. we believe that such transactions are effected on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would have been agreed upon by unrelated parties on an arms length basis. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional related party disclosures.
critical accounting policies management applies those accounting policies that it believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). our more critical accounting policies include those related to the valuation of inventory, long-lived assets, the valuation of goodwill, accruals for long-term employee benefit costs such as pension and other postretirement costs, and accruals for taxes based on income. inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management. management periodically updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment.
inventorywe account for our inventory using the last-in, first-out (lifo) method of accounting.
the cost of raw materials, which represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses, and energy costs generally follow price trends for crude oil and/or natural gas. crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to many factors, including changes in economic conditions. fluctuation in the prices of crude oil and natural gas from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods as market prices recover. accordingly, our cost of sales and results of operations may be affected by such fluctuations.
in may 1, 2010, upon emergence from bankruptcy, we recorded our inventory, which is primarily crude oil and correlated products derived therefrom, at fair value in accordance with the requirements of fresh-start accounting. the per barrel benchmark price of wti crude oil at that date was $86.15.
during 2014, we recorded lcm inventory valuation adjustments totaling $760 million driven primarily by the decline in the price of crude oil and related declines in the prices of heavy liquids and other correlated
products. a $45 million charge was taken in the third quarter of 2014 which marked the beginning of the current downward price trend. since the third quarter of 2014, crude oil and other correlated product price indexes have decreased approximately 50%, leading to the recognition of an additional $715 million of lcm inventory valuation adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2014. further sustained price declines in our finished goods and raw materials will likely result in future lcm inventory valuation charges during the first quarter of 2015.
long-lived assetswith respect to long-lived assets, which primarily include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, key assumptions included estimates of useful lives and the recoverability of carrying values of fixed assets and other intangible assets, as well as the existence of any obligations associated with the retirement of fixed assets. such estimates could be significantly modified and/or the carrying values of the assets could be impaired by such factors as new technological developments, new chemical industry entrants with significant raw material or other cost advantages, uncertainties associated with the european, u.s. and other world economies, the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries, and uncertainties associated with regulatory governmental actions.
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we evaluate definite lived intangible assets for impairment. long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets, which for us is generally at the plant group level (or, at times individual plants in certain circumstances where we have isolated production units with separately identifiable cash flows). when it is probable that the undiscounted cash flows of a tangible asset or asset group will not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. in-process research and development projects are impaired when abandoned.
during the year ended december 31, 2012, we recognized an impairment charge of $22 million, related to damage sustained by our ldpe plant in wesseling, germany.
the estimated useful lives of long-lived assets range from 3 to 30 years. depreciation and amortization of these assets, including amortization of capitalized turnaround costs, under the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives totaled $1,019 million in 2014. if the useful lives of assets are found to be shorter than originally estimated, depreciation and amortization charges would be accelerated over the revised useful life.
goodwillgoodwill of $566 million at december 31, 2014 represents the tax effect of the differences between the tax and book bases of our assets and liabilities resulting from the revaluation of those assets and liabilities to fair value in connection with the companys emergence from bankruptcy and adoption of fresh-start accounting. we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable.
we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. qualitative factors assessed for each of the reporting units include, but are not limited to, changes in long-term commodity prices, discount rates, competitive environments, planned capacity, cost factors such as raw material prices, and financial performance of the reporting units. if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a two-step quantitative test is required.
we also have the option to proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. under the two-step impairment test, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value, including goodwill. for step one of the impairment test, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a discounted cash-flow model. such a model inherently utilizes a significant number of estimates and assumptions, including operating margins, tax rates, discount rates, capital expenditures and working capital changes. step two of the impairment test would be performed should management conclude that the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, is in excess of its fair value. in step two of the impairment test, the carrying amount of a reporting
units goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of its goodwill. valuation experts may be used in such an assessment. if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge equal to the excess would be recognized.
for 2013 and 2012, management performed qualitative impairment assessments of our reporting units which indicated that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value. accordingly, a quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test was not required. in 2014, management voluntarily performed a quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test for all reporting units. the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value. accordingly, no goodwill impairment was recognized in 2014.
long-term employee benefit costsour costs for long-term employee benefits, particularly pension and other postretirement medical and life insurance benefits, are incurred over long periods of time, and involve many uncertainties over those periods. the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties, and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. it is managements responsibility, often with the assistance of independent experts, to select assumptions that in its judgment represent its best estimates of the future effects of those uncertainties. it also is managements responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions.
the current benefit service costs, as well as the existing liabilities, for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis. the discount rate is a current rate, related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled. our assumed discount rate is based on yield information for high-quality corporate bonds with durations comparable to the expected cash settlement of our obligations. for the purpose of measuring the benefit obligations at december 31, 2014, we used a weighted average discount rate of 4.04% for the u.s. plans which reflects the different terms of the related benefit obligations. the weighted average discount rate used to measure obligations for non-u.s. plans at december 31, 2014 was 2.84%, reflecting market interest rates. the discount rates in effect at december 31, 2014 will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during 2015.
the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of other postretirement medical benefits are also measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. as of december 31, 2014, the assumed rate of increase for our u.s. plans was 7.3%, decreasing to 4.5% in 2027 and thereafter. a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate assumption would have no significant effect on either the benefit liability or the net periodic cost, due to limits on our maximum contribution level under the medical plan.
the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption. investment returns that are recognized currently in net income represent the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets applied to a market-related value of plan assets which, for us, is defined as the market value of assets. the expected rate of return on plan assets is a longer term rate, and is expected to change less frequently than the current assumed discount rate, reflecting long-term market expectations, rather than current fluctuations in market conditions.
the weighted average expected long-term rate of return on assets in our u.s. plans of 8.00% is based on the average level of earnings that our independent pension investment advisor had advised could be expected to be earned over time and 4.12%, for our non-u.s. plan assets is based on an expectation and asset allocation that varies by region. the asset allocations are summarized in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. the actual returns in 2014 were a gain of 3.50% for u.s. plan assets and a gain of 28.28% for non-u.s. plan assets.
the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets. managements goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility.
net periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the expected asset earnings, rather than the actual earnings or loss. along with other gains and losses, this unrecognized amount, to the extent it cumulatively exceeds 10% of the projected benefit obligation for the respective plan, is recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service period of the participants in each plan.
the following table reflects the sensitivity of the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans to changes in the actuarial assumptions:

accruals for taxes based on incomethe determination of our provision for income taxes and the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities is subject to managements estimates and judgments due to the complexity of the tax laws and regulations in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of these complex laws and regulations.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse.
we recognize future tax benefits to the extent that the realization of these benefits is more likely than not. our current provision for income taxes is impacted by the recognition and release of valuation allowances related to net deferred assets in certain non-u.s. jurisdictions. further changes to these valuation allowances may impact our future provision for income taxes, which will include no tax benefit with respect to losses incurred and no tax expense with respect to income generated in these countries until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated.
we recognize the financial statement benefits with respect to an uncertain income tax position that we have taken or may take on an income tax return when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities. for a position that is likely to be sustained, the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and results of operations the following represents our consolidated performance highlights:
as of/ year ended december 31,                                      change
operating income                    $402,648                  $228,347                   $49,992                76        %          357        %
consolidated revenues for 2014 and 2013 increased as compared to prior years due to growth in both international and domestic streaming memberships, as well as increases in average revenue per paying member resulting from the introduction of higher priced plans. the increases in operating income and net income in each of the two years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 were due to the increase in revenues, partially offset by the increase in the cost of revenues due to increased content expenses relating to our existing and new streaming content.
we offer three types of streaming membership plans. in the u.s. our basic plan is priced at $7.99 per month and includes access to standard definition quality streaming on a single screen at a time. our most popular streaming plan, which includes access to high definition quality streaming on two screens concurrently, is priced at $8.99 per month for members who joined after the second quarter of 2014 when we had increased the membership fee from $7.99 per month. existing members were grandfathered in at $7.99 for two years, as long as they remain a member. our premium plan, which we introduced in the second quarter of 2013, is priced at $11.99 per month and includes access to high definition and ultra-high definition quality content on four screens concurrently. internationally, pricing for the three types of membership plans is structured similar to the u.s. and ranges from the u.s. dollar equivalent of approximately $6.00 per month to $19.00.
the following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations:
•   we define contribution profit as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses. we believe this is an important measure of our operating segment performance as it represents each segment's performance before discrete global corporate costs.
•   for the domestic and international streaming segments, content expenses, which include the amortization of the streaming content library and other expenses associated with the licensing and acquisition of streaming content, represent the vast majority of cost of revenues. streaming content rights are generally specific to a geographic region and accordingly our international expansion will require us to obtain additional streaming content to support new international markets. other cost of revenues such as streaming delivery expenses, customer service and payment processing fees tend to be lower as a percentage of total cost of revenues as compared to content expenses. we utilize both our own and third-party content delivery networks to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. streaming delivery expenses, therefore, also include equipment costs related to our content delivery network ("open connect") and all third-party costs associated with delivering streaming content over the internet. cost of revenues in the domestic dvd segment consist primarily of delivery expenses, content expenses, including amortization of dvd content library and revenue sharing expenses, and other expenses associated with our dvd processing and customer service centers. delivery expenses for the domestic dvd segment consist of the postage costs to mail dvds to and from our members and the packaging and label costs for the mailers.
•   for the domestic and international streaming segments, marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and payments made to our affiliates and device partners. advertising expenses include promotional activities such as television and online advertising. payments to our affiliates and device partners include fixed fee and /or revenue sharing payments. marketing expenses are primarily incurred by our domestic and international streaming segments given our focus on building consumer awareness of the streaming offerings. marketing expenses incurred by our international streaming segment have been significant and will fluctuate dependent upon the number of international territories in
which our streaming service is offered and the timing of the launch of new territories. marketing expenses are immaterial for the domestic dvd segment.
•   we have demonstrated our ability to grow domestic streaming contribution margin as evidenced by the increase in contribution margin from 17% in 2012 to 27% in 2014. as a result of our focus on growing the streaming segments, contribution margins for the domestic and international streaming segments are lower than for our domestic dvd segment. investments in content and marketing associated with the international streaming segment will continue to fluctuate dependent upon the number of international territories in which our streaming service is offered and the timing of the launch of new territories.

in the domestic streaming segment, we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content offered through a membership plan. the increase in our domestic streaming revenues was due to the 22% growth in the average number of paid memberships, as well as to the 2% increase in average monthly revenue per paying member resulting from our price increase for new members in the second quarter of 2014 and introduction of the higher priced plan in 2013. our two screen high definition plan continues to be the most popular plan choice for new members.
the increase in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to the $242.3 million increase in content expenses relating to our existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming. in addition, streaming delivery expenses increased by $59.5 million and other costs, such as payment processing fees and customer service call centers, increased $36.6 million due to our growing member base.
marketing expenses increased primarily due to an increase in advertising and public relations spending.
our domestic streaming segment had a contribution margin of 27% for the year ended december 31, 2014, which increased as compared to the contribution margin of 23% for the year ended december 31, 2013 due to growth in paid memberships and revenue, which continued to outpace content and marketing spending. the decrease in net membership additions in the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 is a natural progression of our large domestic market as we grow. we expect to continue to increase domestic contribution margins over the next several years even with lower membership growth.

the increase in our domestic streaming revenues was due to the 26% growth in the average number of paid memberships. new member additions and revenue related to $11.99 membership plans that were introduced in the second quarter of 2013 were not material for the year ended december 31, 2013.
the increase in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to the $226.3 million increase in content expenses resulting from continued investments in existing and new streaming content including more exclusive and original programming. in addition, streaming delivery expenses increased by $31.7 million and other costs, such as payment processing fees and customer service call centers, increased $34.8 million due to our growing member base.
marketing expenses increased primarily due to an increase in advertising partially offset by a decrease in payments to affiliates in the u.s.
our domestic streaming segment had a contribution margin of 23% for the year ended december 31, 2013, which increased as compared to the contribution margin of 17% for the year ended december 31, 2012, as a result of growing memberships and revenue faster than content and marketing spending.

in the international streaming segment, we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content offered through a membership plan. we launched our streaming service in canada in september 2010 and have continuously expanded our services internationally with launches in latin america in september 2011, the u.k. and ireland in january 2012, finland, denmark, sweden and norway in october 2012, the netherlands in september 2013, and germany, austria, switzerland, france, belgium and luxembourg in september 2014. in the first quarter of 2015, we expect to launch our service in australia and new zealand. later in the year, we expect to launch additional major countries, in keeping with our global strategy.
the increase in our international revenues was primarily due to the 82% growth in the average number of paid international memberships as well as the 1% increase in average monthly revenue per paying member resulting from the price increase on our most popular streaming plan and the introduction of the premium plan, offset partially by the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. average paid international streaming memberships account for 27% of total average paid streaming memberships as of december 31, 2014, as compared to 20% of total average paid streaming memberships as of december 31, 2013.
the increase in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a $311.5 million increase in content expenses including content for our new markets as well as more exclusive and original programming. other costs increased $60.3 million primarily due to increases in our streaming delivery expenses, costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees, all driven by our growing member base.
international marketing expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 mainly due to expenses for territories launched in the last twelve months.
international contribution losses improved $114.5 million year over year, as a result of growing memberships and revenues faster than content and marketing spending. our international streaming segment does not benefit from the established member base that exists for the domestic segments. as a result of having to build a member base from zero, investments in streaming content and marketing programs for our international segment are larger initially relative to revenues, in particular as new territories are launched. the contribution losses for our international segment have been significant due to investments in streaming content and marketing programs to drive membership growth and viewing in our international markets.

the increase in our international revenues was primarily due to the 134% growth in the average number of paid international memberships.
the increase in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a $272.0 million increase in content expenses. this increase was primarily attributable to continued investments in existing and new streaming content including content to support the launch of our service in the nordics (launched in the fourth quarter of 2012) and the netherlands (launched in the third quarter of 2013). other costs increased $27.0 million due to increases in our streaming delivery expenses, costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees, all driven by our growing member base.
international marketing expenses for the year ended december 31, 2013 increased as compared to the year ended december 31, 2012 due to our expansion in the nordics and the netherlands offset partially by a decrease in spending in other territories.

in the domestic dvd segment, we derive revenues from our dvd-by-mail membership services. the price per plan for dvd-by-mail varies from $4.99 to $43.99 per month according to the plan chosen by the member. dvd-by-mail plans differ by the number of dvds that a member may have out at any given point. members electing access to high definition blu-ray discs, in addition to standard definition dvds, pay a surcharge ranging from $2 to $4 per month for our most popular plans.
the decrease in our domestic dvd revenues was due to a 16% decrease in the average number of paid memberships.
the decrease in domestic dvd cost of revenues was primarily due to a $16.0 million decrease in content expenses and a $43.0 million decrease in delivery expenses resulting from a 22% decrease in the number of dvds mailed to members. the decrease in shipments was driven by a decline in the number of dvd memberships coupled with a decrease in usage by these members. other costs, primarily those associated with processing and customer service expenses, decreased $15.6 million primarily due to a decrease in hub operation expenses resulting from the decline in dvd shipments.
our domestic dvd segment had a contribution margin of 48% for the year ended december 31, 2014, and was flat as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013.

interest and other income (expense) decreased due to increased foreign exchange losses on foreign currency denominated balances. the foreign exchange losses were $8.4 million and $4.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
extinguishment of debt in connection with the redemption of the outstanding $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 8.50% notes, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $25.1 million in the year ended december 31, 2013, which consisted of expenses associated with the redemption, including a $19.4 million premium payment pursuant to the make-whole provision in the indenture governing the 8.50% notes. for further detail see note 5 of item 8, financial statements and supplementary data.
provision for income taxes year ended december 31,        change
in 2014, the difference between our 24% effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 35% was $39.7 million primarily due to the release of tax reserves on previously unrecognized tax benefits of $38.6 million as a result of an irs appeals settlement for the tax years 2008-2009 leading to the reassessment of our reserves for all open years, coupled with the retroactive reinstatement of the 2014 federal research and development ("r&d") credits partially offset by state income taxes, foreign taxes and nondeductible expenses. the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 was primarily attributable to the $38.6 million release of tax reserves on previously unrecognized tax benefits.
on december 19, 2014, the tax increase prevention act of 2014 (h.r. 5771) was signed into law which retroactively extended the federal r&d credit from january 1, 2014 through december 31, 2014. as a result, we recognized the retroactive benefit of the 2014 federal r&d credit of approximately $10.7 million as a discrete item in the fourth quarter of 2014, the period in which the legislation was enacted.
year ended december 31,        change
in 2013, the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of 35% was $1.2 million primarily due to the federal and california r&d credits partially offset by state income taxes and nondeductible expenses. the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2012 was primarily attributable to the retroactive reinstatement of the 2012 federal r&d credit in january 2013.
on january 2, 2013, the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 (h.r. 8) was signed into law which retroactively extended the federal r&d credit from january 1, 2012 through december 31, 2013. as a result, we recognized the retroactive benefit of the 2012 federal r&d credit of approximately $3.1 million as a discrete item in the first quarter of 2013, the period in which the legislation was enacted.
liquidity and capital resources cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1,608.5 million and $1,200.4 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. in february 2014, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.750% senior notes due 2024 (the "5.750% notes"). in february 2013, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due 2021 (the "5.375% notes"). we used approximately $224.5 million of the net proceeds of our 5.375% notes to redeem our outstanding 8.50% notes, including a $19.4 million make-whole premium and $5.1 million of accrued and unpaid interest. in november 2011, we issued $200.0 million of senior convertible notes. the senior convertible notes consisted of $200.0 million aggregate principal amount due on december 1, 2018 and did not bear interest. in april 2013, we exercised our option to cause the conversion of the convertible notes into shares of our common stock. see note 5 of item 8, financial statements and supplementary data for additional information.
our primary uses of cash include content acquisition and licensing, streaming delivery, marketing programs and payroll. payment terms for certain content agreements require more upfront cash payments relative to the expense and therefore, future investments could impact our liquidity.
we expect to significantly increase our investments in international expansion and in streaming content, particularly in original content. as a result, and to take advantage of the current favorable interest rate environment, we plan to obtain at least $1 billion in long-term debt in the first quarter of 2015. our ability to obtain this, or any additional financing that we may choose to or need to obtain, will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.
as of december 31, 2014, $130.8 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries. if these funds are needed for our operations in the u.s., we would be required to accrue and pay u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the amount associated with undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries. as of december 31, 2014, the amount associated with undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries for which we could be required to accrue and pay taxes is $29.2 million. see note 10 of item 8, financial statements and supplementary data for additional information.
free cash flow we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating and investing activities excluding the non-operational cash flows from purchases, maturities and sales of short-term investments. we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities. free cash flow is considered a non-gaap financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, cash flow provided by operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap.
in assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the three major recurring differences are excess content payments over expense, non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other working capital differences. the excess content payments over expense is variable based on the payment terms of our
content agreements and is expected to continue to be significant as we enter into more agreements with upfront cash payments, such as original content agreements. working capital differences include deferred revenue, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. our receivables from members generally settle quickly and deferred revenue is a source of cash flow.

purchases of property and equipment             (69,726     )             (54,143     )
cash provided by operating activities decreased $81.3 million, primarily due to increased payments for content other than dvd library of $835.1 million or 32%, as well as increased payments associated with higher operating expenses. the increased use of cash was partially offset by a $1,130.1 million or 26% increase in revenues.
cash used in investing activities decreased $213.1 million, primarily due to a decrease of $242.2 million in the purchases of short-term investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities. this decrease was offset by an increase of $15.6 million purchases of property and equipment.
cash provided by financing activities increased $65.4 million primarily due to the $392.9 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.750% notes in the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the $490.6 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.375% notes less the $219.4 million redemption of our 8.50% notes in the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was partially offset by a decrease of $56.3 million from the issuance of common stock, including the impact of excess tax benefits.
free cash flow was $393.5 million lower than net income for the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily due to $534.2 million of content cash payments over expense partially offset by $115.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and $25.5 million of favorable other working capital differences.
free cash flow was $128.7 million lower than net income for the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily due to $227.9 million of content cash payments over expense and $45.3 million non-favorable other working capital differences. this was partially offset by $73.1 million non-cash stock-based compensation expense, $46.3 million in deferred revenue and $25.1 million loss on debt extinguishment, the cash impact of which is a financing activity and therefore not included in free cash flow.

cash provided by operating activities increased $76.2 million, primarily due to an increase in revenues of $765.3 million or 21%. this increase was partially offset by increased payments for content acquisition and licensing other than dvd library of $502.6 million or 24% as well as increased payments associated with higher operating expenses. operating activities were further impacted by increased payments for streaming delivery, payment processing fees and customer service call centers due to our growing member base.
cash used in investing activities increased $11.2 million, primarily due to an increase of $17.7 million in the acquisition of dvd content library and a $13.9 million increase in the purchase of property and equipment primarily due to investments in our streaming delivery network. cash outflow was offset by a $23.2 million increase in the proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases.
cash provided by financing activities increased $470.7 million. in the first quarter of 2013, we issued $500.0 million of 5.375% notes, with net proceeds of $490.6 million after payment of debt issuance costs. this was offset by the $219.4 million redemption of our 8.50% senior notes. financing activities were further impacted by $197.6 million of increased cash flows provided by stock option exercises.
free cash flow was $75.3 million lower than net income for the year ended december 31, 2012 primarily due to $143.9 million of content cash payments over expense and $5.3 million non-favorable other working capital differences partially offset by $73.9 million non-cash stock-based compensation expense.
contractual obligations for the purpose of this table, contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of december 31, 2014. timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31, 2014:
(1)   as of december 31, 2014, streaming content obligations were comprised of $2.1 billion included in "current content liabilities" and $1.6 billion of "non-current content liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets and $5.8 billion of
obligations that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as they do not yet meet the criteria for asset recognition.
streaming content obligations increased $2.2 billion from $7.3 billion as of december 31, 2013 to $9.5 billion as of december 31, 2014 primarily due to multi-year commitments associated with our latest market launches in europe and the continued expansion of our exclusive and original programming.
a streaming content obligation is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. once a title becomes available, a content liability is generally recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and / or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. because the amount is not reasonably estimable, we do not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. however, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant and the expected timing of payments could range from less than one year to more than five years. traditional film output deals, like the future output deal with disney, or certain tv series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of license agreements not included in the contractual obligations table. once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the streaming content obligations.
(2)   long-term debt obligations include our 5.375% notes and 5.750% notes consisting of principal and interest payments. see note 5 of item 8, financial statements and supplementary data for further details.
(3)   lease obligations include lease financing obligations of $9.4 million related to our current los gatos, california headquarters for which we are the deemed owner for accounting purposes and commitments of $201.7 million for facilities under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through approximately 2025, including commitments of $122.2 million for facilities lease agreements which will commence after the leased buildings have been constructed.
(4)   other purchase obligations include all other non-cancelable contractual obligations. these contracts are primarily related to streaming delivery, dvd content acquisition, and miscellaneous open purchase orders for which we have not received the related services or goods.
as of december 31, 2014, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $34.8 million and an additional $0.4 million for gross interest and penalties classified as "other non-current liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets. at this time, we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any transactions with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us.
indemnifications the information set forth under note 7 of item 8, financial statements and supplementary data under the caption "guarantees-indemnification obligations" is incorporated herein by reference.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. the securities and exchange commission ("sec") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from these estimates.
streaming content we license and acquire rights to stream tv shows, movies, and original content to members for unlimited viewing. these rights are for a fixed fee and specify windows of availability. payment terms for certain content agreements require more upfront cash payments relative to expense.
we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of liabilities when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. the portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as "current content library, net" and the remaining portion as "non-current content library, net" on the consolidated balance sheets. the acquisition of streaming content rights and the changes in related liabilities are classified within cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
we amortize the content library in "cost of revenues" on a straight line or on an accelerated basis, as appropriate:
•   for content that does not premiere on the netflix service (representing the vast majority of content), we amortize on a straight-line basis over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use, beginning with the month of first availability. the amortization period typically ranges from six months to five years.
•   for content that premieres on the netflix service, we expect more upfront viewing due to the additional merchandising and marketing efforts for this original content available only on netflix. hence, we amortize on an accelerated basis over the amortization period, which is the shorter of four years or the license period, beginning with the month of first availability. if a subsequent season is added, the amortization period is extended by a year.
•   if the cost per title cannot be reasonably estimated, the license fee is not capitalized and costs are expensed on a straight line basis over the license period. this typically occurs when the license agreement does not specify the number of titles, the license fee per title or the windows of availability per title.
we review factors impacting the amortization of the content library, including historical and estimated viewing patterns, on a regular basis. our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.  changes in our estimates could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.
the content library is stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. streaming content (whether capitalized or not) is reviewed in aggregate at the geographic region level for impairment when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content. the level of geographic aggregation is determined based on the streaming content rights which are generally specific to a geographic region inclusive of several countries (such as latin america). no material write down from unamortized cost to a lower net realizable value was recorded in any of the periods presented.
we have entered into certain licenses with performing rights organizations ("pros"), and are currently involved in negotiations with other pros, that hold certain rights to music and other entertainment works "publicly performed" in connection with streaming content into various territories. accruals for estimated license fees are recorded and then adjusted based on any changes in estimates. these amounts are included in the streaming content obligations. the results of these negotiations are uncertain and may be materially different from management's estimates.
income taxes we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.
although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates. however, we believe that it is more
likely than not that substantially all deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets will ultimately be realized. in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination.
we did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. we may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. at december 31, 2014, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $34.8 million of which $29.2 million, if recognized, would favorably impact our future earnings. due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates. see note 10 of item 8, financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding income taxes.
stock-based compensation stock-based compensation expense at the grant date is based on the total number of options granted and an estimate of the fair value of the awards expected to vest and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period.
we calculate the fair value of our stock option grants using a lattice-binomial model. this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be impacted.
•   expected volatility: our computation of expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of tradable forward call options to purchase shares of our common stock. our decision to incorporate implied volatility was based on our assessment that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is more reflective of market conditions and, therefore, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock. low trade volume of our tradable forward call options prior to 2011 precluded sole reliance on implied volatility, and as such we include historical volatility in our computation of expected volatility. an increase/decrease of 10% in our computation of expected volatility would increase/decrease the total stock-based compensation expense by approximately $10.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014.
•   suboptimal exercise factor: our computation of the suboptimal exercise factor is based on historical option exercise behavior and is determined for both executives and non-executives. an increase/decrease in the suboptimal exercise factor of 10% would increase/decrease the total stock-based compensation expense by approximately $2.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014.

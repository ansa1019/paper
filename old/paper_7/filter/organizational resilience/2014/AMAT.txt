item 7:   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to facilitate an understanding of applied's business and results of operations. this md&a should be read in conjunction with applied's consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k. the following discussion contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement set forth at the beginning of this form 10-k. md&a consists of the following sections:
•   overview: a summary of applied's business and measurements
•   results of operations: a discussion of operating results
•   segment information: a discussion of segment operating results
•   business combinations: a summary of announced or completed business combinations and acquisitions
•   recent accounting pronouncements: a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and its impact to applied's consolidated financial statements
•   financial condition, liquidity and capital resources: an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations and financial position
•   off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations
•   critical accounting policies and estimates: a discussion of critical accounting policies that require the exercise of judgments and estimates
•   non-gaap adjusted results: a presentation of results reconciling gaap to non-gaap adjusted measures overview applied provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar photovoltaic (pv) and related industries. applied's customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips, flat panel liquid crystal and other displays, solar pv cells and modules, and other electronic devices. these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components. applied operates in four reportable segments: silicon systems group, applied global services, display, and energy and environmental solutions. a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements. a discussion of factors that could affect applied's operations is set forth under "risk factors" in part i, item 1a, which is incorporated herein by reference. product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in the united states, europe, israel, and asia. applied's broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force.
applied's results are driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors, which in turn depends on end-user demand for electronic products. each of applied's businesses is subject to cyclical industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, display technologies, solar pvs and other electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as global economic and market conditions, and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes. in addition, a significant driver in the semiconductor and display industries is end-demand for mobile consumer products, which is characterized by seasonality that impacts the timing of customer investments in manufacturing equipment and, in turn, applied's business. in light of these conditions, applied's results can vary significantly year-over-year, as well as quarter-over-quarter.
applied's strategic priorities for fiscal 2015 include growing its presence in wafer fab and display equipment and services, and improving profitability in solar, as well as expanding applied's overall available market.
on september 24, 2013, applied announced an agreement with tokyo electron limited (tel), a japanese corporation and global supplier of semiconductor, and flat panel display production equipment, and provider of technical support and services for semiconductor, flat panel display and pv panel production equipment, to effect a combination of their respective businesses into a new combined company. the combination is expected to bring together leading technologies and products and create an expanded set of capabilities in precision materials engineering and patterning. in june 2014, the shareholders of applied and tel approved the proposed business combination. under the agreement, which was amended february 14, 2014, the closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approvals.
results of operations the following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years:

(1)   fiscal 2014 amount differs from the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in applied's press release issued on november 13, 2014, reflecting an increase to provision for income taxes of $34 million and a decrease to earnings per diluted share of $0.03. this adjustment is not considered material and does not affect applied's previously announced non-gaap adjusted results.
reconciliations of non-gaap adjusted measures are presented under "non-gaap adjusted results" below. fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 each contained 52 weeks.
mobility, including the increasing technological functionality of mobile devices, continued to be the largest driver of semiconductor industry spending in fiscal 2014. during the year, demand for advanced mobile chips drove continued demand for semiconductor equipment by foundry customers. in addition, demand for semiconductor equipment from memory customers improved as manufacturers invested in technology upgrades. mobility also represents a significant driver of display industry spending, which has resulted in continued manufacturing capacity expansion for mobile applications. demand for larger lcd tvs is also driving investment in display equipment, although the tv manufacturing sector remains susceptible to cyclical conditions. investment in solar equipment remained low during fiscal 2014, despite continued end-market growth, due to ongoing excess manufacturing capacity in the industry.
applied expects the mobility trend to remain the main growth driver for the semiconductor industry, and in turn for the silicon systems group, in 2015. the growth in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry is expected to be driven by foundry and memory spending. applied also expects display equipment investment to remain healthy in 2015.
fiscal 2013 was characterized by strong demand for semiconductor equipment from foundry customers driven by demand for advanced mobile chips. in the second half of fiscal 2013, demand from foundry customers softened, reflecting seasonal consumer buying patterns for mobility products, while demand from memory and logic customers improved. mobility also represented a significant driver of display industry spending, and demand for mobile display equipment remained strong during fiscal 2013. fiscal 2013 was also characterized by a recovery in demand for tv manufacturing equipment compared to weak industry levels in fiscal 2012, resulting from higher consumer demand in emerging markets and for larger lcd tvs. investment in solar equipment remained low during fiscal 2013 due to continued excess manufacturing capacity in the industry.
fiscal 2012 was characterized by significant fluctuations in demand for semiconductor equipment, coupled with an extremely weak market environment for display and solar equipment. applied completed its acquisition of varian semiconductor equipment associates, inc. (varian) in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. mobility was the greatest influence on semiconductor industry spending in fiscal 2012. investment levels for display equipment were low in fiscal 2012 due to decreased capacity requirements for larger flat panel televisions, while demand for mobility products, such as smartphones and tablets, significantly influenced equipment spending. in the solar industry, fiscal 2012 was characterized by excess manufacturing capacity, which led to significantly reduced demand for crystalline-silicon (c-si) equipment, as well as weak operating performance and outlook.
2014                                                                        change                           2013               change                           2012

new orders increased in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 across all segments, primarily due to higher demand for semiconductor equipment, semiconductor spares and services, and display equipment. new orders for the silicon systems group and applied global services continued to comprise a majority of applied's consolidated total new orders.
new orders for fiscal 2013 increased compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to a recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment and increased demand in semiconductor equipment, partially offset by lower demand for service products, as well as depressed demand for c-si solar equipment due to excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry.
new orders by geographic region, determined by the product shipment destination specified by the customer, were as follows:
2014                                                    change                           2013               change                           2012
the changes in new orders from customers in the united states, japan, taiwan and korea for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily reflected changes in customers mix in the silicon systems group, while the increase in new orders from china resulted from increased demand from display manufacturing equipment.
the recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment in fiscal 2013 led to the increase in new orders from customers in china. the change in the composition of new orders from customers in taiwan, korea, japan and the united states was primarily related to changes in customer demand for semiconductor equipment.
changes in backlog during fiscal 2014 and 2013 were as follows:
net adjustments           (31   )            (191   )
backlog consists of: (1) orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months, or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized; and (2) contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months. applied's backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods, due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders. approximately 80 percent of the backlog as of the end of fiscal 2014 is anticipated to be shipped within the first two quarters of fiscal 2015.
applied's backlog was $2.9 billion at october 26, 2014 compared to $2.4 billion at october 27, 2013. backlog adjustments were negative for fiscal 2014 and totaled $31 million, consisting of financial debookings, foreign exchange and other adjustments.
backlog by reportable segment as of october 26, 2014 and october 27, 2013 was as follows:
2014                                                                           change                              2013

net sales for all segments increased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. the increase primarily reflected increased customer investments in semiconductor and display equipment, as well as semiconductor spares and services. the silicon systems group remains the largest contributor of net sales.
for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, net sales in display increased, reflecting the recovery of tv manufacturing equipment investment, while net sales across all other segments decreased. the decrease primarily reflected continued excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry and lower investments in semiconductor equipment, spares and services.
net sales by geographic region, determined by the location of customers' facilities to which products were shipped, were as follows:
2014                                                    change                           2013               change                           2012
net sales from customers in china increased for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to greater investments in semiconductor, display and solar manufacturing equipment, while net sales from customers in the united states increased due to higher investments in semiconductor equipment.
the increase in net sales from customers in china in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment. the changes in net sales from customers in korea, the united states and taiwan were primarily related to changes in customer demand for semiconductor equipment.

gross margin and non-gaap gross margin increased in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily reflecting higher net sales, the recovery of a regional customs duty assessment charge recorded in fiscal 2013, sales of display and solar tools that had been written down previously, lower manufacturing costs and change in product mix.
gross margin and non-gaap adjusted gross margin decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily reflecting lower sales. gross margin percent and non-gaap adjusted gross margin percent increased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 despite lower sales, due primarily to lower inventory charges, a favorable product mix, and material cost reductions. gross margin and non-gaap adjusted gross margin during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 included $53 million, $50 million and $54 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.
research, development and engineering research, development and engineering (rd&e) expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows:
change
research, development and engineering      $1,428              $1,320              $1,237          $108                    $83
applied's future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides. management believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rd&e to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers' most advanced designs. applied has maintained and intends to continue its commitment to investing in rd&e in order to continue to offer new products and technologies. development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product, which typically has a shorter development cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer development cycle. most of applied's existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies, materials and processes. in certain instances, applied acquires technologies, either in existing or new product areas, to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market.
in fiscal 2014, applied increased its investments primarily in the areas of 3d chip technology and 300mm product development. applied's 3d rd&e investments were focused on products for overcoming the challenges of finfet and 3d nand designs at sub-2x nanometer nodes and enabling cost-effective manufacturing of these high-performance 3d chips. applied also developed new applications for its epitaxial technology to enable the industry's transition to nmos transistors at the 20nm node, thereby enabling chip makers to build faster devices and deliver next-generation mobile computing power.
rd&e expenses increased in fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year and also in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012, reflecting the impact of ongoing product development initiatives. as part of its growth strategy, applied has taken certain actions, including workforce reductions and reprioritization of existing spend, to enable increased funding for investments in technical capabilities and critical rd&e programs in current and new markets, with a focus on semiconductor technologies. rd&e expense during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 included $66 million, $53 million and $54 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.
marketing and selling marketing and selling expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows:
change
marketing and selling      $423              $433              $481          $(10          )         $(48          )
the decrease in marketing and selling expenses for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was mainly due to headcount reductions. the decrease in marketing and selling expenses for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to savings from restructuring programs along with a reduction in the bad debt provision during the year as a result of lower risk exposures among display and solar customers. marketing and selling expenses during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 included $23 million, $20 million and $22 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.
change
g&a expenses for fiscal 2014 increased slightly compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to integration planning costs associated with the announced business combination with tel, partially offset by a gain on the sale of foreign exchange option contracts associated with the business combination and proceeds from a favorable litigation outcome. the decrease in g&a for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the absence of certain costs incurred during fiscal 2012 associated with the acquisition of varian, savings from restructuring programs, and lower share-based compensation expense, partially offset by costs associated with the proposed business combination with tel. g&a expenses during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 included $35 million, $34 million and $52 million respectively, of share-based compensation expense.
impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, applied performed an annual qualitative assessment to test goodwill for all of its reporting units for impairment. applied determined that it was more likely than not that each of its reporting units' fair values exceeded its respective carrying values and that it was not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for any of its reporting units.
during fiscal 2013 and 2012, the solar industry faced a deterioration in market conditions associated with manufacturing overcapacity and weak operating performance and outlook, resulting in uncertainties regarding the timing and nature of a recovery in solar capital equipment expenditures. applied performed a two-step goodwill impairment test and, as a result, recorded $224 million and $421 million of goodwill impairment charges in its energy and environmental solutions segment in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. in fiscal 2013, applied also performed an impairment test for long-lived assets associated with the energy and environmental solutions reporting unit and determined that the majority of intangible assets were impaired, mostly due to the lower long-term revenue and profitability outlook associated with products related to these intangible assets. accordingly, during fiscal 2013, applied recorded an impairment charge of $54 million related to these intangible assets, which was the amount by which the carrying value of these intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair value, based on discounted projected cash flows.
the evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment requires the exercise of significant judgment. in the event of future changes in business conditions, applied will reassess and update its forecasts and estimates used in future impairment analyses. if the results of these analyses are lower than current estimates, a material impairment charge may result at that time.

restructuring and asset impairments restructuring and asset impairment expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows:
change
restructuring and asset impairments, net      $5             $63              $168          $(58          )         $(105         )
on october 3, 2012, applied announced a restructuring plan (the 2012 global restructuring plan) to realign its global workforce and enhance its ability to invest for growth. under this plan, applied implemented a voluntary retirement program and other workforce reduction actions that affected approximately 1,300 positions. as of january 26, 2014, principal activities related to this plan were complete. during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, applied recognized $5 million, $39 million and $106 million, respectively, of employee-related costs in connection with the 2012 global restructuring plan. total costs incurred in implementing this plan were $150 million, none of which were allocated to the operating segments.
on may 10, 2012, applied announced a plan (the 2012 ees restructuring plan) to restructure its energy and environmental solutions segment in light of challenging industry conditions affecting the solar photovoltaic and light-emitting diode (led) equipment markets. as part of the 2012 ees restructuring plan, applied relocated certain manufacturing, business operations and customer support functions of its precision wafering systems business and ceased led development activities. this plan impacted approximately 300 positions globally. as of october 27, 2013, principal activities related to this plan were complete. total costs incurred in implementing this plan were $87 million, of which $13 million were inventory-related charges. during fiscal 2013 and 2012, applied recognized $26 million and $48 million, respectively, of restructuring and asset impairment charges in connection with the 2012 ees restructuring plan. as of october 26, 2014, there were no remaining severance accruals associated with restructuring reserves under this program.
also in fiscal 2013 and 2012, applied incurred $2 million and $14 million, respectively, of severance and other employee-related costs in connection with the integration of varian.
for further details, see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements.

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was significantly lower than the rate for fiscal 2012 due primarily to the geographic composition of applied's pre-tax income, lower nondeductible goodwill impairment charges, and reinstatement of the u.s. federal research and development tax credit retroactive to its expiration in december 2012. these reductions were partially offset by a lower benefit in fiscal 2013 from the u.s. federal domestic production deduction.
segment information applied reports financial results in four segments: silicon systems group, applied global services, display, and energy and environmental solutions. a description of the products and services, as well as financial data, for each reportable segment can be found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements. applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain operating expenses that it manages separately at the corporate level. these unallocated costs include costs for share-based compensation; certain management, finance, legal, human resource, and rd&e functions provided at the corporate level; and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy. in addition, applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions, unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment.
silicon systems group segment the silicon systems group segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for deposition, etch, ion implantation, rapid thermal processing, chemical mechanical planarization, metrology and inspection, and wafer packaging. development efforts are focused on solving customers' key technical challenges in transistor, patterning, interconnect and packaging performance as devices scale to advanced technology nodes. the mobility trend remains the largest influence on industry spending, as it drives device manufacturers to continually improve their ability to deliver high-performance, low-power processors and affordable solid-state storage in a small form factor.
with the acquisition of varian, applied acquired ion implantation technology for semiconductor as well as c-si solar cell manufacturing, which was recorded under the silicon systems group segment in fiscal 2012. in fiscal 2013, applied began marketing the solar implant products commercially through its energy and environmental solutions segment. accordingly, effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, applied accounts for its solar implant products under the energy and environmental solutions segment. the effect of the solar implant products was not material to the operations of either the silicon systems group or energy and environmental solutions segments.

the composition of new orders for the silicon systems group by end use application for the past three fiscal years was as follows:
one region accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the silicon systems group segment for one or more of the past three fiscal years:
change
customers in taiwan accounted for 37 percent, 45 percent and 32 percent of total net sales for the silicon systems group in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. customers in the united states, china and korea together contributed 47 percent, 37 percent and 54 percent of the total net sales for this segment in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
financial results in the silicon systems group for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 reflected the overall increase in wafer fab equipment spending in the semiconductor industry. the increase in new orders and net sales in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily reflected increased demand and spending from memory customers, as well as continued demand from foundry customers. three customers accounted for approximately 54 percent of net sales and three customers accounted for 75 percent of new orders in this segment in fiscal 2014. operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income for fiscal 2014 increased compared to fiscal 2013, reflecting the increase in net sales, partially offset by changes in product mix and higher rd&e spend. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, new orders were $1.3 billion, a decrease of 15 percent compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to lower orders from memory and foundry customers. approximately 44 percent of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were for orders received and shipped within the quarter, which increased slightly from 43 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2014.
the increase in new orders in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily reflected increased demand from memory customers. net sales decreased in fiscal 2013 from the prior year due to overall decreased wafer fab equipment spending in the semiconductor industry. three customers accounted for approximately 65 percent of new orders and net sales in this segment in fiscal 2013. operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income for fiscal 2013 decreased compared to fiscal 2012, reflecting the decrease in net sales, changes in product mix and higher rd&e spend.
applied global services segment the applied global services segment encompasses integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity, including spares, upgrades, services, remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor, display and solar products. customer demand for products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer sites.

there were no individual regions that accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the applied global services segment for any of the past three fiscal years.
new orders and net sales for fiscal 2014 increased compared to fiscal 2013 mainly due to increased demand for semiconductor spares and services, as well as 200mm equipment systems and equipment upgrades. operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income increased in fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year, reflecting the increase in net sales as well as the recovery of a regional customs duty assessment charge recorded in fiscal 2013.
for fiscal 2013, new orders and net sales decreased compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to lower demand and investments for semiconductor spares and services. the decrease in net sales was also due to lower investments in display upgrades. fiscal 2012 net sales also included $85 million in sales for a thin film solar production line. operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012, reflecting lower sales and a $20 million customs duty assessment, partially offset by lower operating expenses from spending controls.
display segment the display segment encompasses products for manufacturing liquid crystal displays (lcds), organic light-emitting diodes (oleds), and other display technologies for tvs, personal computers (pcs), tablets, smart phones, and other consumer-oriented devices. the segment is focused on expanding its presence through technologically-differentiated equipment for manufacturing large-scale tvs; entry into new markets such as low temperature polysilicon (ltps), metal oxide, and touch panel sectors; and development of products that enable cost reductions through productivity and uniformity. display industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced lcd tvs and high resolution displays for next generation mobile devices.

the following regions accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the display segment for one or more of the past three fiscal years:
change
in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, customers in china accounted for 80 percent, 48 percent and 28 percent, respectively, of the display segment's total net sales. customers in korea and taiwan together accounted for 20 percent of total net sales for the display segment in fiscal 2014 compared to 42 percent in fiscal 2013, and 57 percent in fiscal 2012. the increase in net sales from customers in china reflected tv manufacturing capacity expansion, while the decrease in net sales from customers in korea and taiwan primarily related to lower sales of mobile display manufacturing equipment.
new orders and net sales for fiscal 2014 increased compared to the prior year reflecting strong tv manufacturing capacity expansions. operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income increased over the prior year, due primarily to higher net sales, sales of tools for which inventory had been written down previously, better installation and warranty performance, and material and manufacturing cost reductions, partially offset by increased research and development expenses. four customers accounted for approximately 87 percent of new orders for the display segment in fiscal 2014, with two customers accounting for approximately 50 percent of new orders. four customers accounted for approximately 77 percent of net sales for this segment in fiscal 2014, with one customer accounting for approximately 40 percent of net sales. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, new orders were $130 million, down 56 percent from the prior quarter, primarily reflecting continued variability in industry order patterns. net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were $190 million, up 60 percent compared to the prior quarter as a result of shipment of tv manufacturing equipment to customers in china.
fiscal 2013 operating results reflected a recovery in demand for tv manufacturing equipment and continued demand for advanced mobile display equipment, which resulted in increased new orders, net sales, operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income compared to fiscal 2012. two customers accounted for approximately 50 percent of net sales for the display segment in fiscal 2013.
energy and environmental solutions segment the energy and environmental solutions segment includes products for fabricating crystalline-silicon (c-si), solar pv wafers and cells, as well as high throughput roll-to-roll deposition equipment for flexible electronics, packaging and other applications. this business is focused on delivering solutions to generate and conserve energy, with an emphasis on lowering the cost to produce solar modules and increasing conversion efficiency. while end-demand for solar pvs has been robust over the last several years, investment in capital equipment remained low as global pv production capacity exceeds anticipated demand. the solar equipment environment improved slightly in fiscal 2014 compared to the previous year.

in fiscal 2014, customers in china accounted for 62 percent of total net sales for the energy and environmental solutions segment compared to 58 percent in fiscal 2013, and 49 percent in fiscal 2012.
new orders and net sales for fiscal 2014 increased compared to fiscal 2013 but remained at low levels due to continued excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry. one customer accounted for approximately 23 percent of net sales for this segment during fiscal 2014. operating margin and non-gaap adjusted operating margin increased for fiscal 2014 compared to prior year, reflecting increased net sales, lower inventory charges, sales of solar tools that were written down previously and continued cost reduction measures, proceeds from a favorable litigation outcome, and spending controls. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, new orders were $44 million, down from $66 million in the prior quarter, and net sales were $48 million, down 53 percent from the prior quarter.
fiscal 2013 financial results continued to reflect excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry, which resulted in low levels of new orders and net sales, and consequently an operating loss for the segment. operating loss for fiscal 2013 included $278 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, as well as restructuring and asset impairment charges of $25 million associated with the 2012 ees restructuring plan discussed above. details on goodwill and intangible asset impairment and restructuring and asset impairment charges are also included in note 9 and note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
business combinations tokyo electron limited on september 24, 2013, applied and tokyo electron limited (tel) entered into a business combination agreement, which was amended on february 14, 2014, to effect a strategic combination of their respective businesses into a new combined company. tel, a japanese corporation, is a global supplier of semiconductor and flat panel display production equipment, and a provider of technical support and services for semiconductor, flat panel display and photovoltaic panel production equipment. under the terms of the business combination agreement, tel shareholders will receive 3.25 shares of the new combined company for every tel share held. applied shareholders will receive one share of the new combined company for every applied share held. based on the number of shares of applied common stock and shares of tel common stock expected to be issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the transaction, it is anticipated that, immediately following the transaction, former applied stockholders and former tel shareholders will own approximately 68% and 32%, respectively, of the new combined company.
the new combined company, eteris n.v., will have dual headquarters in tokyo and santa clara and dual listing of its shares on the tokyo stock exchange and nasdaq, and will be incorporated in the netherlands. in june 2014, the shareholders of applied and tel approved the proposed business combination. the closing of the transaction remains subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approvals. it is expected that the combined company will commence a $3.0 billion stock repurchase program targeted to be executed within 12 months following the closing of the transaction.
the business combination agreement contains mutual pre-closing covenants, including the obligation of applied and tel to conduct their businesses in the ordinary course consistent in all material respects with past practices. the agreement also contains termination rights for applied and tel and provides that upon certain events, such as a termination due to a change in recommendation by the other party or a termination relating to certain tax rulings, a termination fee of $400 million is payable.
on november 10, 2011, applied completed the acquisition of varian, a public company manufacturer of semiconductor processing equipment and the leading supplier of ion implantation equipment used by chip makers globally, for an aggregate purchase price of $4.2 billion in cash, net of cash acquired and assumed earned equity awards of $27 million, pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated as of may 3, 2011. applied's primary reasons for this acquisition were to complement existing product offerings and to provide opportunities for future growth. the acquired business is primarily included in results for the silicon systems group and applied global services segments.
applied funded the transaction with a combination of existing cash balances and debt. on june 8, 2011, applied issued senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion and used the net proceeds of the notes to fund a portion of the consideration and certain costs associated with the acquisition. see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of long-term debt.
for further details, see note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued authoritative guidance that requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. this new standard will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. the guidance becomes effective for applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and can be applied either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. early adoption is prohibited. applied is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on applied's financial position and its ongoing financial reporting, including the selection of a transition method.
in april 2014, the fasb issued authoritative guidance that raises the threshold for a disposal transaction to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires additional disclosures about discontinued operations and disposals of individually significant components that do not qualify as discontinued operations. the authoritative guidance becomes effective prospectively for applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued.
in july 2013, the fasb issued authoritative guidance that will require an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward, with certain exceptions. the authoritative guidance becomes effective for applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, with early adoption permitted. the guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on applied's financial position.
financial condition, liquidity and capital resources applied's cash, cash equivalents and investments increased to $4.1 billion at october 26, 2014 from $2.9 billion at october 27, 2013.
cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following:
sources and uses of cash a summary of cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows:
cash provided by operating activities             $1,800                 $623           $1,851
operating activities cash from operating activities for fiscal 2014 was $1.8 billion, which reflects net income adjusted for the effect of non-cash charges and changes in working capital components. non-cash charges included depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, unrealized loss on derivatives associated with announced business combination, restructuring and asset impairments and deferred income taxes. the increase in cash from operating activities from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to higher business volume and improved working capital performance.
applied discounted $29 million of letters of credit issued by customers in fiscal 2014. applied did not utilize programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers in fiscal 2013 and 2012. discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. applied factored accounts receivable and discounted promissory notes of $45 million in fiscal 2014, and $93 million in fiscal 2012. there was no factoring of accounts receivable or discounting of promissory notes in fiscal 2013.
applied's working capital was $4.1 billion at october 26, 2014 and $3.2 billion at october 27, 2013.
days sales, inventory and payable outstanding at the end of each of the periods indicated are:
days sales outstanding varies due to the timing of shipments and the payment terms. days sales outstanding decreased at the end of fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in revenue and better linearity. the days sales outstanding in fiscal 2012 included a favorable impact from the timing of the sale of thin film production line during the year. days inventory outstanding remained flat in fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014. the increase in days payable outstanding from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013 primarily reflected an increase in accounts payable due to increase in inventory purchases near the end of the period to support projected customer demand.
investing activities applied used $161 million of cash in investing activities in fiscal 2014 and $4.7 billion in fiscal 2012. applied generated $215 million in cash from investing activities in fiscal 2013. capital expenditures were $241 million in fiscal 2014, $197 million in fiscal 2013, and $162 million in fiscal 2012. capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 were primarily for demonstration and test equipment and infrastructure improvements in north america, including creation of a new pilot operation facility and distribution center. capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 were primarily for demonstration and test equipment as well as laboratory tools and equipment upgrades in north america. capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 were primarily for various information technology expenditures in north america, including the addition of varian, and expansion of semiconductor assembly centers in singapore. proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases of investments, totaled $67 million in fiscal 2014 and $406 million in fiscal 2013, while purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, totaled $308 million in fiscal 2012. investing activities also included investments in technology and acquisitions of companies to allow applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies. in fiscal 2012, applied acquired varian for $4.2 billion, net of cash acquired.
applied's investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds, u.s. treasury and agency securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, as well as equity securities. applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures, which may include the sale of certain securities, to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies.
financing activities applied used cash in financing activities in the amount of $348 million in fiscal 2014, $519 million in fiscal 2013, and $1.8 billion in fiscal 2012 which activities included payment of cash dividends to stockholders and issuances and repurchases of common stock. applied did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during fiscal 2014. cash used to repurchase shares totaled $245 million in fiscal 2013 and $1.4 billion in fiscal 2012. the majority of these repurchases were made under a share repurchase program approved in march 2012 by applied's board of directors authorizing up to $3.0 billion in repurchases over the next three years ending in march 2015, of which $1.6 billion remained available for future stock repurchases at october 26, 2014. proceeds from stock issuances related to equity compensation awards were $137 million in fiscal 2014, $182 million in fiscal 2013, and $96 million in fiscal 2012.
during fiscal 2014, applied's board of directors declared four quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share each. during fiscal 2013, applied's board of directors declared three quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share each and one quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share. during fiscal 2012, applied's board of directors declared three quarterly cash dividends of $0.09 per share each and one quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per share. cash paid in dividends during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 amounted to $485 million, $456 million and $434 million, respectively. applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on applied's financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of applied's stockholders.
applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to $1.6 billion, of which $1.5 billion is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in may 2017. this agreement provides for borrowings in united states dollars at interest rates keyed to one of the two rates selected by applied for each advance and includes financial and other covenants. these covenants require applied to maintain certain minimum financial ratios. applied was in compliance with all such covenants at october 26, 2014. remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $75 million are with japanese banks. applied's ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks' prime reference rate denominated in japanese yen. no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities at both october 26, 2014 and october 27, 2013, and applied has not utilized these credit facilities. in connection with the proposed business combination with tel, applied intends to amend or replace its undrawn $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement.
in fiscal 2011, applied established a short-term commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion. at october 26, 2014 and october 27, 2013, applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding.
applied issued senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.95 billion. the following table summarizes the notes issued:
the indenture governing the notes includes certain covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 26, 2014. see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of long-term debt.
others during fiscal 2014 and 2013, applied did not record any additional bad debt provision but released $16 million and $13 million, respectively, of its allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of an overall lower risk profile of applied's customers. while applied believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at october 26, 2014 is adequate, it will continue to closely monitor customer liquidity and economic conditions.
as of october 26, 2014, approximately $2.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries may be subject to u.s. taxes if repatriated for u.s. operations. of this amount, applied intends to permanently reinvest approximately $2.1 billion of these funds outside of the u.s. and does not plan to repatriate these funds. for the remaining cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries, u.s. taxes have been provided for in the financial statements.
although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above, applied's management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy applied's liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. for further details regarding applied's operating, investing and financing activities, see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report.
for details on standby letters of credit and other agreements with banks, see off-balance sheet arrangements below.
off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either applied or its subsidiaries. as of october 26, 2014, the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately $46 million. applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements.
applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. as of october 26, 2014, applied materials inc. has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately $102 million to cover these arrangements.
applied also has operating leases for various facilities. total rent expense was $37 million for fiscal 2014, $36 million for fiscal 2013, and $38 million for fiscal 2012.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes applied's contractual obligations as of october 26, 2014:
operating lease obligations                                          70       28                                   28                  9                        5
1   represents applied's agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of applied's (a) outstanding purchase orders for goods and services; and (b) contractual requirements to make specified minimum payments even if applied does not take delivery of the contracted goods.
2   other long-term liabilities do not include noncurrent income taxes payable, noncurrent deferred income taxes payable and certain tax-related liabilities due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments.
in addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above, applied has certain tax obligations. gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year have been reported as non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. as of october 26, 2014, the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $134 million. increases or decreases to interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are included in provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations. interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $25 million as of october 26, 2014 and $7 million as of october 27, 2013, and were classified as a noncurrent liability in the consolidated balance sheets. at this time, applied is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes and, accordingly, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies.
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied's consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied's financial condition or results of operations. specifically, these policies have the following attributes: (1) applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and (2) different estimates applied could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on applied's financial condition or results of operations.
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as applied's operating environment changes. these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. in addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. these uncertainties include those discussed in part i, item 1a, "risk factors." based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that applied's consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, and provide a meaningful presentation of applied's financial condition and results of operations.
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates:
revenue recognition applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is probable. each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements. in addition, applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables. judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. moreover, judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on applied's financial condition and results of operations.
warranty costs applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product, current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs. applied's warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. as applied's customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs. the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs. unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs. if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied's estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
allowance for doubtful accounts applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. this allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection history and any customer-specific issues applied has identified. changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer's ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends, may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
inventory valuation inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. in addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
goodwill and intangible assets applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment. intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using both the income approach and the market approach taking into account such factors as future anticipated operating results and estimated cost of capital. management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment, especially in emerging markets. a severe decline in market conditions could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
income taxes the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits. management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective tax rate as required. if actual results differ from these estimates, applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective tax rate, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses and tax credit carryovers. deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. management has determined that it is more likely than not that applied's future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation allowance.
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied's expectations could have a material impact on applied's results of operations and financial condition.
non-gaap adjusted results management uses non-gaap adjusted results to evaluate operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. applied believes these measures enhance investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods. the non-gaap adjusted results presented below exclude the impact of the following, where applicable: certain items related to acquisitions or the announced business combination; restructuring charges and any associated adjustments; impairments of assets, goodwill, or investments; gain or loss on sale of strategic investments or facilities; and certain tax items. these non-gaap adjusted measures are not in accordance with gaap and may differ from non-gaap methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. the presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap.

during the third quarter of 2018, we formally commenced a restructuring plan accelerate 2020 ("the plan"), to leverage technology and systems investments and organizational changes. subsequent to year-end, we raised our goals for the plan to simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity and management layers, consolidate facilities and focus on key long-term growth areas by leveraging technology and structural improvements. we expect the expanded restructuring activities will be completed by the end of 2020, with anticipated costs of $260 million ($190 million after tax), or $0.65 per diluted share, over this period of time. costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance costs and some facility closure costs relating to team reorganizations. actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken. the restructuring actions are expected to result in approximately $325 million of annual cost savings by 2021.
our global footprint and broad business portfolio within the global energy segment, as well as our strong execution capabilities are expected to provide the required resilience to outperform in the current market. as such, we continue to remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of the segment.

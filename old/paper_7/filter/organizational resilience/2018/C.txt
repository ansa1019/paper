management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary as described further throughout this executive summary, citi made steady progress in 2018 toward improving its profitability and returns, despite a more challenging revenue environment, particularly in certain market-sensitive businesses and given macroeconomic uncertainties. during 2018, citi reported 3% underlying revenue growth in global consumer banking (gcb) and institutional clients group (icg), excluding the impact of gains on sale in 2018 and 2017 (see "citigroup" below). citi had solid revenue growth across treasury and trade solutions, private bank, securities services, equity markets and corporate lending in icg, partially offset by weakness in fixed income as well as softness in equity and debt underwriting. citi reported revenue growth in all regions in gcb, reflecting continued loan and overall deposit growth, partially offset by the near-term impact of weak market sentiment on asia wealth management revenues, as well as the impact from partnership renewal terms that went into effect in 2018 in citi-branded cards in north america gcb.
citi demonstrated strong expense discipline, resulting in a 1% decrease in expenses, as well as positive operating leverage, even as citi continued to make ongoing investments. citi's positive operating leverage, combined with continued credit discipline, resulted in an improvement in pretax earnings. citi also generated continued loan and deposit growth during the year.
moreover, citi continued to return capital to its shareholders. in 2018, citi returned $18.4 billion in the form of common stock repurchases and dividends. citi repurchased over 200 million shares during the last year, resulting in an 8% reduction in outstanding common shares. while citi made continued progress in returning capital to shareholders, each of citi's key regulatory capital metrics remained strong (see "capital" below).
going into 2019, while global economic growth has continued and the underlying macroeconomic environment remains largely positive, there continue to be various economic, political and other risks and uncertainties that could create a more volatile operating environment and impact citi's businesses and future results. for a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could impact citi's businesses, results of operations and financial condition during 2019, see each respective business's results of operations, "risk factors" and "managing global risk" below. despite these risks and uncertainties, citi intends to continue to build on the progress made during 2018 with a focus on further optimizing its performance to benefit shareholders, while remaining flexible and adapting to market and economic conditions as they develop.
2018 summary results citigroup citigroup reported net income of $18.0 billion, or $6.68 per share, compared to a net loss of $6.8 billion, or $2.98 per share, in the prior year. results in 2017 included a one-time, non-cash charge of $22.6 billion, related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act (tax reform), which impacted the tax line within corporate/other, as well as the tax lines in north america gcb and icg. results in 2018 included a one-time benefit of $94 million, due to the finalization of the provisional component of the impact based on citi's analysis as well as additional guidance received from the u.s. treasury department related to tax reform, which impacted the tax line within corporate/other (for additional information, see "significant accounting policies and estimates-income taxes" below).
excluding the one-time impact of tax reform in both the current and prior year, citigroup net income of $18.0 billion increased 14% compared to the prior year, reflecting a lower effective tax rate, higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by higher cost of credit. on this basis, earnings per share increased 25%, due to growth in net income and the 8% reduction in average shares outstanding, driven by the common stock repurchases. (citi's results of operations excluding the impact of tax reform are non-gaap financial measures. citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding the one-time impact of tax reform in both the current and prior year provides a meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.)
citigroup revenues of $72.9 billion in 2018 increased 1%, as 3% growth in gcb and 1% growth in icg were largely offset by a 33% decrease in corporate/other, primarily due to the continued wind-down of legacy assets. results in 2017 included a one-time gain (approximately $580 million) on the sale of a fixed income analytics business in icg, and results in 2018 included a one-time gain (approximately $250 million) on the sale of an asset management business in latin america gcb. excluding the gains on sale in both periods, aggregate revenues in icg and gcb grew 3% from the prior year.
citigroup's end-of-period loans increased 3% to $684 billion versus the prior year. excluding the impact of foreign currency translation into u.s. dollars for reporting purposes (fx translation), citigroup's end-of-period loans grew 4%, as 8% growth in icg and 3% growth in gcb were partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in corporate/other. (citi's results of operations excluding the impact of gains on sales and fx translation are non-gaap financial measures. citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding the impact of gains on sales and fx translation provides a meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.)
citigroup's end-of-period deposits increased 6% to $1.0 trillion versus the prior year. excluding the impact of fx translation, citigroup's deposits were up 7%, primarily reflecting a 10% increase in icg and a 1% increase in gcb.
expenses citigroup operating expenses of $41.8 billion decreased 1% versus the prior year, as efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets more than offset the impact of higher volume-
related expenses and ongoing investments. operating expenses in both icg and gcb were up 3%, while corporate/other operating expenses declined 40%, all versus the prior year.
cost of credit citi's total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims of $7.6 billion increased 2% from the prior year, driven by higher net loan loss reserve builds and higher net credit losses. the net loan loss reserve build of $354 million compared to a net loan loss reserve build of $266 million in the prior year. the increase largely reflected a modest net loan loss reserve build in icg, compared to a net loan loss reserve release in the prior year, partially offset by lower net loan loss reserve builds in north america gcb.
net credit losses of $7.1 billion increased 1% versus the prior year. consumer net credit losses increased 4% to
$6.9 billion, largely reflecting volume growth and seasoning in the north america cards portfolios, partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in corporate/other. corporate net credit losses decreased 55% to $169 million, primarily reflecting the impact of an episodic charge-off incurred in the prior year.

capital citigroup's common equity tier 1 capital and tier 1 capital ratios were 11.9% and 13.5% as of december 31, 2018, respectively, compared to 12.4% and 14.1% as of december 31, 2017, both based on the basel iii standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. the decline in regulatory capital largely reflected the return of capital to common shareholders, partially offset by earnings growth. citigroup's supplementary leverage ratio as of december 31, 2018 was 6.4%, compared to 6.7% as of december 31, 2017. for additional information on citi's capital ratios and related components, see "capital resources" below.
global consumer banking gcb net income of $5.8 billion increased 49%. excluding the one-time impact of tax reform in the prior year, gcb net income increased 25%, driven primarily by a lower effective tax rate and higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. operating expenses were $18.6 billion, up 3%, as higher volume-related expenses and continued investments were partially offset by efficiency savings.
gcb revenues of $33.8 billion increased 3% versus the prior year, driven by growth across all regions. north america gcb revenues increased 1% to $20.5 billion, driven by higher revenues across all businesses. citi-branded cards revenues of $8.6 billion were up 1% versus the prior year, as growth in interest-earning balances was largely offset by the previously disclosed impact of partnership renewal terms. citi retail services revenues of $6.6 billion increased 3% versus the prior year, primarily reflecting organic loan growth and the benefit of the l.l.bean portfolio acquisition, partially offset by higher partner payments. retail banking revenues increased 1% from the prior year to $5.3 billion. excluding mortgage revenues, retail banking revenues of $4.8 billion were up 6% from the prior year, driven by continued growth in deposit margins, partially offset by lower deposit volumes.
north america gcb average deposits of $180 billion decreased a net 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by a reduction in money market balances, as clients transferred money to investments. north america gcb average retail loans of $56 billion grew 1% from the prior year. assets under management of $60 billion were largely unchanged from the prior year, as 5% underlying growth was offset by the impact of market movements, due to the equity market sell-off at the end of 2018. average citi-branded card loans of $88 billion increased 4%, while citi-branded card purchase sales of $344 billion increased 8% versus the prior year. average citi retail services loans of $48 billion increased 6% versus the prior year, while citi retail services purchase sales of $87 billion were up 7%. for additional information on the results of operations of north america gcb for 2018, see "global consumer banking-north america gcb" below.
international gcb revenues (consisting of latin america gcb and asia gcb (which includes the results of operations in certain emea countries)) increased 5% versus the prior year to $13.2 billion. excluding the impact of fx translation, international gcb revenues increased 6% versus the prior year. latin america gcb revenues increased 13% versus the prior year, including the gain on sale in 2018. excluding the gain on sale, latin america gcb revenues increased 8%, driven by growth in loans and deposits as well as improved deposit spreads. asia gcb revenues increased 2% versus the prior year, as continued growth in deposit, cards and insurance revenues was largely offset by lower investment revenues due to weak market sentiment. for additional information on the results of operations of latin america gcb and asia gcb for 2018, including the impact of fx translation, see "global consumer banking-latin america gcb" and "global consumer banking-asia gcb" below.
year-over-year, international gcb average deposits of $127 billion increased 4%, average retail loans of $90 billion increased 3%, assets under management of $98 billion decreased 1%, average card loans of $24 billion increased 2% and card purchase sales of $104 billion increased 7%, all excluding the impact of fx translation.
institutional clients group icg net income of $12.2 billion increased 35%. excluding the one-time impact of tax reform in the prior year, icg net income increased 11%, driven by a lower effective tax rate and higher revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses and higher cost of credit. icg operating expenses increased 3% to $21.0 billion, as higher compensation costs, volume-related expenses and continued investments were partially offset by efficiency savings.
icg revenues were $37.0 billion in 2018, up 1% from the prior year, as a 6% increase in banking revenues was largely offset by a 3% decrease in markets and securities services, including the impact of the gain on sale in the prior year. excluding the gain on sale in the prior year, revenues increased 3%, primarily driven by a 6% increase in banking
revenues, as markets and securities services revenues were largely unchanged versus the prior year. the increase in banking revenues included the impact of $45 million of gains on loan hedges within corporate lending, compared to losses of $133 million in the prior year.
banking revenues of $19.9 billion (excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges within corporate lending) increased 5%, driven by solid growth in treasury and trade solutions, private bank and corporate lending, partially offset by lower revenues in investment banking. investment banking revenues of $5.0 billion decreased 7% versus the prior year, as growth in advisory was more than offset by a decline in both debt and equity underwriting, largely reflecting lower market activity. advisory revenues increased 16% to $1.3 billion, equity underwriting revenues decreased 12% to $991 million and debt underwriting revenues decreased 13% to $2.7 billion, all versus the prior year.
treasury and trade solutions revenues of $9.3 billion increased 8% versus the prior year, reflecting volume growth and improved deposit spreads, with solid growth across net interest and fee income. private bank revenues increased 9% to $3.4 billion from the prior year, driven by growth in investments, as well as improved deposit spreads. corporate lending revenues increased 26% to $2.3 billion. excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, corporate lending revenues increased 15% versus the prior year, primarily driven by loan growth and lower hedging costs.
markets and securities services revenues of $17.0 billion decreased 3% from the prior year. excluding the gain on sale in the prior year, markets and securities services revenues were largely unchanged from the prior year, as a decline in fixed income markets revenues was offset by an increase in both equity markets and securities services revenues. fixed income markets revenues of $11.6 billion decreased 6% from the prior year, driven by lower revenues in both rates and currencies and spread products, reflecting the more challenging environment. equity markets revenues of $3.4 billion increased 19% from the prior year (14% excluding an episodic loss in derivatives in the prior year), driven by growth in derivatives and prime finance as well as higher investor client revenue, partially offset by a modest decline in cash equities. securities services revenues of $2.6 billion increased 11%, driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue. for additional information on the results of operations of icg for 2018, see "institutional clients group" below.
corporate/other corporate/other net income was $107 million in 2018, compared to a net loss of $19.7 billion in the prior year. excluding the one-time impact of tax reform in both periods, corporate/other net income declined 92% to $13 million, largely reflecting lower revenues, partially offset by lower operating expenses and lower cost of credit. operating expenses of $2.3 billion declined 40% from the prior year, largely reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets, lower infrastructure costs and lower legal expenses. corporate/other revenues were $2.1 billion, down 33% from the prior year, primarily reflecting the continued wind-down of legacy assets. for additional information on the results of operations of corporate/other for 2018, see "corporate/other" below.

global consumer banking global consumer banking (gcb) consists of consumer banking businesses in north america, latin america (consisting of citi's consumer banking business in mexico) and asia. gcb provides traditional banking services to retail customers through retail banking, including commercial banking, and citi-branded cards and citi retail services (for additional information on these businesses, see "citigroup segments" above and "managing global risk-consumer credit" below). gcb is focused on its priority markets in the u.s., mexico and asia with 2,410 branches in 19 countries and jurisdictions as of december 31, 2018. asia gcb also includes traditional retail banking and citi-branded card products that are provided to retail customers in certain emea countries. at december 31, 2018, gcb had approximately $432 billion in assets and $308 billion in deposits.
gcb's overall strategy is to leverage citi's global footprint and be the pre-eminent bank for the emerging affluent and affluent consumers in large urban centers. in credit cards and in certain retail markets (including commercial banking), citi serves customers in a somewhat broader set of segments and geographies.

net income increased 68%, largely reflecting the impact of the $750 million one-time, non-cash charge recorded in the tax line due to the impact of tax reform in 2017 (for additional information, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates-income taxes" below). excluding the one-time impact of tax reform, net income increased 22%, driven primarily by a lower effective tax rate due to tax reform, higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses.
revenues increased 1%, driven by higher revenues across all businesses.
retail banking revenues increased 1%. excluding mortgage revenues (decline of 27%), retail banking revenues were up 6%, driven by continued growth in deposit margins, partially offset by lower deposit volumes. average deposits decreased 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by a reduction in money market balances, as clients transferred money to investments. assets under management were largely unchanged from the prior year as 5% underlying growth was offset by the impact of market movements, due to the equity market sell-off at the end of 2018. the decline in mortgage revenues was driven by lower origination activity and higher cost of funds, reflecting the higher interest rate environment.
cards revenues increased 1%. in citi-branded cards, revenues increased 1%, as growth in interest-earning balances, driven by maturity of recent vintages and strength in loan balance retention, was largely offset by the impact of previously disclosed partnership terms that went into effect in 2018. citi sold its hilton portfolio in the first quarter of 2018, which resulted in a gain of approximately $150 million. this gain was offset by the loss of operating revenue in the portfolio in 2018. average loans increased 4% and purchase sales increased 8%.
citi retail services revenues increased 3%, primarily reflecting organic loan growth and the benefit of the l.l.bean portfolio acquisition in june 2018, partially offset by higher partner payments. average loans increased 6% and purchase sales increased 7%.
expenses increased 4%, as volume growth and ongoing investments were partially offset by efficiency savings.
provisions decreased 3% from the prior year, driven by a lower net loan loss reserve build, partially offset by higher net credit losses. the net loan loss reserve build was $438 million in 2018, primarily reflecting volume growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios. this compares to a build of $873 million in the prior year, which included $300 million related to an increase in net flow rates in later delinquency buckets in citi retail services and a slight increase in delinquencies for the citi-branded cards portfolio.
net credit losses increased 6% to $5.1 billion, driven by higher net credit losses in both citi-branded cards (up 6% to $2.6 billion) and citi retail services (up 9% to $2.4 billion). the increase in the cards net credit losses primarily reflected volume growth and seasoning in both portfolios.
for additional information on north america gcb's retail banking, including commercial banking, and its citi-branded cards and citi retail services portfolios, see "credit risk-consumer credit" below.
as part of its citi retail services business, citi issues co-brand and private label credit card products with sears. as previously disclosed, in october 2018, sears filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and in connection with the filing sears has closed, or announced plans to close, additional stores. on february 11, 2019, after bankruptcy court approval, esl investments, inc. purchased substantially all of sears' assets on a going concern basis, including its credit card program agreement with citi. the impact to citi retail services, from reduced new account acquisitions or lower purchase sales, will depend in part on the magnitude and timing of additional sears store closures and continued customer attrition. citi does not currently expect that the sale of sears to esl will have an immediate or ongoing material impact on citi's consolidated results. for additional information on the potential impact from a deterioration in or failure to maintain citi's co-branding and private label credit card relationships, see "risk factors-strategic risks" below.
net income decreased 39% largely due to the one-time impact of tax reform. excluding the one-time impact of tax reform, net income decreased 15%, due to higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.
revenues increased 3%, driven by higher revenues across all businesses.
retail banking revenues increased 1%. excluding mortgage revenues (down 32%), retail banking revenues were up 9%, driven by growth in checking deposits, loans (average loans up 3%) and assets under management (up 14%) and increased commercial banking activity, as well as a benefit from higher interest rates.
cards revenues increased 3%. in citi-branded cards, revenues increased 5%, primarily reflecting the acquisition of the costco portfolio, as well as modest growth in interest-earning balances, partially offset by the continued run-off of non-core portfolios and the higher cost to fund growth in transactor and promotional balances.
citi retail services revenues increased 1%, as loan growth was partially offset by the impact of the renewal and extension of certain partnerships within the portfolio, as well as the absence of gains on sales of two cards portfolios in 2016.
expenses increased 2%, driven by the addition of the costco portfolio, higher volume-related expenses and investments as well as remediation costs related to a card act matter, partially offset by efficiency savings.
net credit losses increased 22%, largely driven by higher net credit losses in both cards portfolios, primarily reflecting volume growth and seasoning, as well as the impact of acquiring the costco portfolio.
the net loan loss reserve build was $873 million, compared to a build of $659 million in the prior year, driven by volume growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios, as well as the increase in net flow rates in later delinquency buckets, primarily in citi retail services.

retail banking revenues increased 14%. excluding the gain on sale, retail banking revenues increased 7%, driven by continued growth across commercial loans and deposits, as well as improved deposit spreads due to higher interest rates. average loans grew 3%, and average deposits grew 6%, while assets under management declined 5%, primarily driven by market performance during the second half of 2018. cards revenues increased 9%, due to continued volume growth, reflecting higher purchase sales (up 11%) and full-rate revolving loans. average cards loans grew 6%.
expenses increased 8%, driven by volume growth, ongoing investment spending and higher repositioning charges, partially offset by efficiency savings. as previously disclosed, citi continues to execute on its investment plans for citibanamex (totaling more than $1 billion through 2020), including initiatives to modernize the branch network, enhance digital capabilities and upgrade core operating platforms.

the discussion of the results of operations for asia gcb below excludes the impact of fx translation for all periods presented. presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of fx translation, are non-gaap financial measures. for a reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.
net income increased 18%, reflecting higher revenues and a lower effective tax rate as a result of tax reform, partially offset by higher cost of credit.
retail banking revenues increased 2%, as continued growth in deposit and insurance revenues was partially offset by lower investment revenues due to weak market sentiment. average deposits increased 3% and assets under management grew 1%, while investment sales decreased 8%. retail lending revenues increased 1%, as volume growth in personal and commercial loans was largely offset by lower mortgage revenues due to spread compression. average retail banking loans grew 3%.
cards revenues increased 2%. excluding the benefit of modest one-time gains in the prior year, revenues increased 4%, driven by continued growth in purchase sales (up 6%) and average loans (up 2%).
expenses were largely unchanged, as volume-driven growth and ongoing investment spending were offset by efficiency savings.
provisions increased 17%, primarily driven by higher net credit losses and a modest net loan loss reserve build compared to a modest net loan loss reserve release in the prior year due to volume growth. overall credit quality continued to remain stable in the region.
for additional information on asia gcb's retail banking portfolios, including commercial banking, and its citi-branded cards portfolio, see "credit risk-consumer credit" below.
net income increased 19%, reflecting higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses.
revenues increased 5%, driven by improvement in cards and wealth management revenues, partially offset by continued lower retail lending revenues.
retail banking revenues increased 3%, primarily due to higher investment revenues, driven by improved investor sentiment, partially offset by the repositioning of the retail loan portfolio. the lower retail lending revenues (down 4%) reflected lower average loans (down 1%) due to the continued optimization of the portfolio away from lower yielding mortgage loans.
cards revenues increased 8%, reflecting 5% growth in average loans and 6% growth in purchase sales, both of which benefited from the portfolio acquisition in australia, as well as modest gains related to sales of merchant acquiring businesses in certain countries.
expenses increased 1%, resulting from volume-driven growth and ongoing investment spending, partially offset by efficiency savings.
institutional clients group institutional clients group (icg) includes banking and markets and securities services (for additional information on these businesses, see "citigroup segments" above). icg provides corporate, institutional, public sector and high-net-worth clients around the world with a full range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, private banking, cash management, trade finance and securities services. icg transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products.
icg revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities. icg earns fee income for assisting clients with transactional services and clearing and providing brokerage and investment banking services and other such activities. such fees are recognized at the point in time when citigroup's performance under the terms of a contractual arrangement is completed, which is typically at the trade/execution date or closing of a transaction. revenue generated from these activities is recorded in commissions and fees and investment banking. revenue is also generated from assets under custody and administration, which is recognized as/when the associated promised service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the point in time the service is requested by the customer and provided by citi. revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in administration and other fiduciary fees. for additional information on these various types of revenues, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
in addition, as a market maker, icg facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. these price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in principal transactions (for additional information on principal transactions revenue, see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). other primarily includes mark-to-market gains and losses on certain credit derivatives, realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (afs) debt securities, gains and losses on equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and losses. interest income earned on assets held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt and to customers on deposits, is recorded as net interest revenue.
the amount and types of markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence and other macroeconomic conditions. assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. however, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product inventory. for example, a decrease in market liquidity may increase bid/offer spreads, decrease client activity levels and widen credit spreads on product inventory positions.
icg's management of the markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of the above factors at the trading desk as well as the country level. icg does not separately track the impact on total markets revenues of the volume of transactions, bid/offer spreads, fair value changes of product inventory positions and economic hedges because, as noted above, these components are interrelated and are not deemed useful or necessary individually to manage the markets businesses at an aggregate level.
in the markets businesses, client revenues are those revenues directly attributable to client transactions at the time of inception, including commissions, interest or fees earned. client revenues do not include the results of client facilitation activities (e.g., holding product inventory in anticipation of client demand) or the results of certain economic hedging activities.
icg's international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 98 countries and jurisdictions. at december 31, 2018, icg had approximately $1.4 trillion of assets and $690 billion of deposits, while two of its businesses-securities services and issuer services-managed approximately $17.5 trillion of assets under custody as of december 31, 2018 and 2017.

(1)   credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. gains (losses) on loan hedges includes the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. the fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. citigroup's results of operations excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-gaap financial measures.
(2)   2017 includes the approximate $580 million gain on the sale of a fixed income analytics business. 2016 includes a charge of approximately $180 million, primarily reflecting the write-down of citi's net investment in venezuela due to changes in the exchange rate.
(3)   excludes principal transactions revenues of icg businesses other than markets and securities services, primarily treasury and trade solutions and the private bank.
the discussion of the results of operations for icg below excludes (where noted) the impact of gains (losses) on hedges of accrual loans, which are non-gaap financial measures. for a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.
net income increased 35%, reflecting the impact of a $2.0 billion one-time, non-cash charge recorded in the tax line due to the impact of tax reform in 2017 (for additional information, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates-income taxes" below). excluding the one-time impact of tax reform, net income increased 11%, driven primarily by a lower effective tax rate as a result of tax reform and higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit.
•   revenues increased 1%, reflecting a 6% increase in banking (including the gains (losses) on loan hedges), largely offset by a 3% decrease in markets and securities services. excluding the impact of a gain of approximately $580 million on the sale of a fixed income analytics business in the prior year, revenues increased 3%, primarily driven by a 6% increase in banking revenue, as markets and securities services revenues were largely unchanged versus the prior year. excluding the impact of the gains (losses) on loan hedges, banking revenues increased 5%, driven by solid growth across treasury and trade solutions, private bank and corporate lending. excluding the gain on sale in the prior year, markets and securities services revenues were largely unchanged, as increases in equity markets and securities services revenues were offset by a decrease in fixed income markets revenues. citi expects that revenues in its markets and investment banking businesses will likely reflect the overall market environment during 2019.
•   investment banking revenues decreased 7%, largely reflecting a decline in market wallet and market share across debt and equity underwriting as well as the comparison to the particularly strong performance in the prior year. advisory revenues increased 16%, reflecting strength in north america, driven by gains in wallet share and increased market activity. equity underwriting revenues decreased 12%, primarily driven by lower revenues in emea. debt underwriting revenues decreased 13%, primarily driven by lower revenues in north america.
•   treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 8%. excluding the impact of fx translation, revenues increased 9%, reflecting strength in all regions, driven by growth across both net interest and fee income. revenues increased in the cash business, primarily driven by continued growth in deposit balances and improved deposit spreads due to higher interest rates, as well as higher transaction volumes from both new and existing clients. the trade business experienced strong revenue growth, as the business continued to focus on high-quality loan growth, while spreads remained largely stable throughout the year. average deposits increased 6%, with growth across regions. average trade loans increased 4%, driven by growth in emea and asia.
•   corporate lending revenues increased 26%. excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, revenues increased 15%, driven by higher loan volumes and lower hedging costs. average loans increased 9% versus the prior year.
•   private bank revenues increased 9%, driven by underlying growth across all regions, reflecting improved deposit spreads due to higher interest rates and higher managed investment revenues.
within markets and securities services:
•   fixed income markets revenues decreased 6%, driven by lower revenues in north america and asia. the decrease in revenues was due to lower net interest revenue (decrease of 16%), as non-interest revenues were largely unchanged. the decline in net interest revenues was driven by rates and currencies as well as spread products and other fixed income revenues, mainly reflecting a change in the mix of trading positions in support of client activity, as well as higher funding costs, given the higher interest rate environment.
rates and currencies revenues decreased 5%, primarily driven by lower g10 rates revenues in north america, asia and emea, reflecting lower client activity given the uncertain macroenvironment and challenging trading environment, and comparison to a strong prior year, particularly in emea. this decrease in revenues was partially offset by higher g10 fx revenues, particularly in emea, reflecting the continued benefit from the return of volatility in fx markets as well as strong corporate and investor client activity. spread products and other fixed income revenues decreased 8%, driven by north america, primarily due to the challenging trading environment characterized by widening spreads and lower investor client activity.
•   equity markets revenues increased 19%. excluding an episodic loss in derivatives of approximately $130 million related to a single client event in the prior year, revenues increased 14%, as growth in equity derivatives and prime finance was partially offset by lower cash equities revenues. excluding the episodic loss in the prior year, equity derivatives revenues increased in all regions, driven by strong investor and corporate client activity as well as a more favorable market environment. principal transaction revenues increased, partially offset by a decrease in net interest revenue, mainly reflecting a change in the mix of trading positions in support of client activity. prime finance revenues increased, particularly in emea and asia, reflecting growth in client balances and higher investor client activity. cash equities revenues decreased modestly, primarily driven by asia, due to a more challenging trading environment.
•   securities services revenues increased 11%. excluding the impact of fx translation, revenues increased 13%, reflecting continued strength in emea and asia. the increase in revenues was driven by higher fee revenues, reflecting growth in client volumes, as well as higher net interest revenue driven by higher deposit volumes and higher interest rates.
expenses increased 3%, as higher compensation, volume-related expenses and continued investments were partially offset by efficiency savings.
provisions increased $199 million, driven by a net loan loss reserve build of $12 million (compared to a net release of $380 million in the prior year), partially offset by a 53% decline in net credit losses. the modest net loan loss reserve build was driven by volume-related reserve builds for both funded loans and unfunded lending commitments, despite credit quality remaining stable during 2018. the decline in net credit losses was largely driven by the absence of a single client event in the fourth quarter of 2017.
net income decreased 5%, reflecting the one-time impact of tax reform in 2017. excluding the one-time impact of tax reform in 2017, net income increased 16%, primarily driven by higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses.
•   revenues increased 7%, reflecting a 16% increase in banking (including the losses on loan hedges). excluding the impact of the losses on loan hedges, banking revenues increased 12%. markets and securities services revenues were largely unchanged, as growth in securities services revenues (increase of 8%) as well as the gain on the sale of the fixed income analytics business in 2017 were offset by a 5% decrease in fixed income markets and a 2% decrease in equity markets revenues.
•   investment banking revenues increased 21%, largely reflecting gains in wallet share and increased market activity. advisory revenues increased 11%, equity underwriting revenues increased 69% and debt underwriting revenues increased 13%.
•   treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 8%. excluding the impact of fx translation, revenues increased 7%, primarily due to continued growth in transaction volumes and deposit balances and improved spreads. trade revenues increased modestly, driven by steady loan growth, partially offset by an industry-wide tightening of loan spreads.
•   corporate lending revenues increased 58%. excluding the impact of losses on loans hedges, revenues increased 12%, driven by lower hedging costs and the absence of a prior-year adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing transaction.
•   private bank revenues increased 14%, primarily due to higher loan and deposit volumes, higher deposit spreads and increased managed investments and capital markets activity.
within markets and securities services:
•   fixed income markets revenues decreased 5%, primarily due to low volatility as well as the comparison to higher revenues in the prior year from a more robust trading environment. the decline in revenues was driven by lower net interest revenue, largely due to higher funding costs and a change in the mix of trading positions in support of client activity. the decline was partially offset by higher principal transactions revenues and commissions and fees revenues.
rates and currencies revenues decreased 5%, driven by lower g10 rates and currencies revenues. spread products and other fixed income revenues decreased 6%, due to a difficult trading environment in 2017 given low volatility, driving lower credit markets and commodities revenues, partially offset by higher municipals revenues, as well as higher securitized markets revenues.
•   equity markets revenues decreased 2%. excluding the episodic loss in derivatives of approximately $130 million related to a single client event in 2017, revenues increased 3%, as continued growth in prime finance and delta one client balances and higher investor client activity were partially offset by lower episodic activity with corporate clients. excluding the episodic loss in derivatives, equity derivatives revenues increased, driven by the stronger investor client activity. cash equities revenues were modestly higher as well, partially offset by lower cash commissions, as clients continued to move toward automated execution platforms across the industry.
•   securities services revenues increased 8%. excluding the impact of the divestiture of a private equity fund services business in 2016, revenues increased 12%, driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue due to a more favorable rate environment.
expenses increased 4%, as higher compensation, volume-related expenses and investments were partially offset by efficiency savings.
provisions improved $501 million, driven by a net loan loss release of $380 million (compared to a net release of $30 million in 2016) and a 29% decline in net credit losses. the increase in net loan loss reserve releases was driven by an improvement in the provision for unfunded lending commitments in the corporate loan portfolio, as well as a favorable credit environment, stability in commodity prices and continued improvement in the portfolio. the decline in net credit losses was largely driven by improvement in the energy sector, partially offset by the impact of the single client event noted above.
corporate/other corporate/other includes certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and compliance), other corporate expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses and income taxes, as well as corporate treasury, certain north america legacy consumer loan portfolios, other legacy assets and discontinued operations (for additional information on corporate/other, see "citigroup segments" above). at december 31, 2018, corporate/other had $91 billion in assets, an increase of 17% from the prior year.

net income was $107 million in 2018, compared to a net loss of $19.7 billion in the prior year, primarily driven by the $19.8 billion one-time, non-cash charge recorded in the tax line in 2017 due to the impact of tax reform. results in 2018 included the one-time benefit of $94 million in the tax line, related to tax reform. for additional information, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates-income taxes" below.
excluding the one-time impact of tax reform in 2018 and 2017, net income decreased 92%, reflecting lower revenues, partially offset by lower expenses, lower cost of credit and tax benefits related to the reorganization of certain non-u.s. subsidiaries. the tax benefits were largely offset by the release of a foreign currency translation adjustment (cta) from aoci to earnings (for additional information on the cta release, see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements).
revenues decreased 33%, driven by the continued wind-down of legacy assets.
expenses decreased 40%, primarily driven by the wind-down of legacy assets, lower infrastructure costs and lower legal expenses.
provisions decreased $27 million to a net benefit of $202 million, primarily due to lower net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release. net credit losses declined 86% to $21 million, primarily reflecting the impact of ongoing divestiture activity and the continued wind-
down of the north america mortgage portfolio. the net reserve release declined by $96 million to $221 million, and reflected the continued wind-down of the legacy north america mortgage portfolio and divestitures.
the net loss was $19.7 billion, compared to net income of $521 million in the prior year, primarily driven by the one-time impact of tax reform. excluding the one-time impact of tax reform, net income declined 69% to $168 million, reflecting lower revenues, partially offset by lower expenses and lower cost of credit.
revenues declined 40%, primarily reflecting the continued wind-down of legacy assets and the absence of gains related to debt buybacks in 2016. revenues included approximately $750 million in gains on asset sales in the first quarter of 2017, which more than offset a roughly $300 million charge related to the exit of citi's u.s. mortgage servicing operations in the quarter.
expenses declined 24%, reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets and lower legal expenses, partially offset by approximately $100 million in episodic expenses primarily related to the exit of the u.s. mortgage servicing operations. also included in expenses is an approximately $255 million provision for remediation costs related to a card act matter in 2017.
provisions decreased $244 million to a net benefit of $175 million, primarily due to lower net credit losses and a lower provision for benefits and claims, partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release. net credit losses declined 66%, primarily reflecting the impact of ongoing divestiture activity and the continued wind-down of the north america mortgage portfolio. the decline in the provision for benefits and claims was primarily due to lower insurance activity. the net reserve release declined $147 million, and reflected the continued wind-down of the legacy north america mortgage portfolio and divestitures.
off-balance sheet arrangements citigroup enters into various types of off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business. citi's involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including without limitation:
•   providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties; and
•   entering into operating leases for property and equipment.
citi enters into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes. for example, securitization arrangements offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. securitization arrangements also assist citi and its customers in monetizing their financial assets and securing financing at more favorable rates than citi or the customers could otherwise obtain.
the table below shows where a discussion of citi's various off-balance sheet arrangements may be found in this form 10-k. in addition, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

(2)   contractual obligations related to interest payments on long-term debt for 2019-2023 are calculated by applying the december 31, 2018 weighted-average interest rate (3.87%) on average outstanding long-term debt to the average remaining contractual obligations on long-term debt for each of those years. the "thereafter" interest payments on long-term debt for the remaining years to maturity (2024-2098) are calculated by applying current interest rates on the remaining contractual obligations on long-term debt for each of those years.
(3)   purchase obligations consist of obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on citi. for presentation purposes, purchase obligations are included in the table above through the termination date of the respective agreements, even if the contract is renewable. many of the purchase agreements for goods or services include clauses that would allow citi to cancel the agreement with specified notice; however, that impact is not included in the table above (unless citi has already notified the counterparty of its intention to terminate the agreement).
(4)   other liabilities reflected on citigroup's consolidated balance sheet includes accounts payable, accrued expenses, uncertain tax positions and other liabilities that have been incurred and will ultimately be paid in cash; legal reserve accruals are not included in the table above. also includes discretionary contributions in 2018 for citi's employee-defined benefit obligations for the pension, postretirement and post employment plans and defined contribution plans.

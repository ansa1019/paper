item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion and analysis should be read together with the factors discussed in item 1a "risk factors" and with the consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. period-to-period comparisons of financial data are not necessarily indicative, and therefore should not be relied upon as indicators, of the trust's future performance. words or phrases such as "does not believe" and "believes," or similar expressions, when used in this form 10-k or other filings with the sec, are intended to identify "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
overview the trust was organized in 1888 and holds title to extensive tracts of land in numerous counties in west texas which were previously the property of the texas and pacific railway company. we continue to manage those lands for the benefit of the holders of certificates of proprietary interest in the trust (and/or sub-shares in the certificates of proprietary interest).
our revenues are derived primarily from oil, gas and water-related royalties, sales of water and land, easements and leases of the land. due to the nature of our operations, our revenue is subject to substantial fluctuations from quarter to quarter and year to year. we do not actively solicit sales of land. in addition, the demand for, and sale price of, particular tracts of land is influenced by many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, the rate of development in nearby areas and the suitability of the particular tract for the ranching uses prevalent in western texas.
we are not an oil and gas producer. rather, our oil and gas revenue is derived from our oil and gas royalty interests. thus, in addition to being subject to fluctuations in response to the market prices for oil and gas, our oil and gas royalty revenues are also subject to decisions made by the owners and operators of the oil and gas wells to which our royalty interests relate as to investments in and production from those wells. we monitor production reports by the oil and gas companies to assure that we are being paid the appropriate royalties. we review conditions in the agricultural industry in the areas in which our lands are located and seek to keep as much of our lands as possible under lease to local ranchers.
our revenue from easements is generated from easement contracts covering activities such as oil and gas pipelines and subsurface wellbore easements. the majority of our easements have a ten-year term. we also enter into agreements with operators and mid-stream companies to lease land from us, primarily for facilities and roads.
in prior years, we entered into agreements with energy companies and oilfield service businesses to allow such companies to explore for water, drill water wells, construct water-related infrastructure and purchase water sourced from land that we own. energy businesses use water for their oil and gas projects while non-energy businesses (i.e., water management service companies) operate water facilities to produce and sell water to energy businesses. we continue to collect revenue from royalties and water sales under these legacy agreements.
demand for water solutions is expected to grow as drilling and completion activity in the permian basin continues to increase. in response to that demand, the trust formed tpwr in june 2017. tpwr, a single member llc and wholly owned subsidiary of the trust, focuses on providing full-service water offerings to operators in the permian basin. these services include, but are not limited to, brackish water sourcing, produced-water gathering/treatment/recycling, infrastructure development/construction, disposal, water tracking, analytics and well testing services. tpwr is committed to sustainable water development with significant focus on the large-scale implementation of recycled water operations.
results of operations we operate our business in two segments: land and resource management and water service and operations. we eliminate any inter-segment revenues and expenses upon consolidation.
we analyze financial results for each of our reportable segments. the reportable segments presented are consistent with our reportable segments discussed in note 10, "business segment reporting" in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10-k. we monitor our reporting segments based upon revenue and net income calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap").
the following is an analysis of our operating results for the comparable periods by reportable segment (in thousands):
land and resource management oil and gas royalties                      $123,834          41   %           $58,418          38   %
sale of oil and gas royalty interests        18,875           6   %                 -           -   %

water service and operations                 50,125          24   %            18,763          19   %
land and resource management land and resource management segment revenues increased $88.1 million, or 71.5%, to $211.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared with revenues of $123.3 million for the comparable period of 2017.
oil and gas royalties. oil and gas royalty revenue was $123.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $58.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of 112.0%. oil royalty revenue was $94.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $36.9 million for the comparable period of 2017. this increase in oil royalty revenue is principally due to the combined effect of a 110.0% increase in crude oil production subject to the trust's royalty interest, and a 21.6% increase in the average price per royalty barrel of crude oil received during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. gas royalty revenue was $29.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, an increase of 111.4% over the year ended december 31, 2017 when gas royalty revenue was $13.8 million. this increase in gas royalty revenue resulted from a volume increase of 178.5% for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the same period of 2017, partially offset by a 24.2% decrease in the average price received. additionally, oil and gas royalties for the year ended december 31, 2017 included $7.7 million related to the settlement of an arbitration with chevron u.s.a., inc. (the "chevron settlement") in september 2017. see part i, item 1. business in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information. no such settlement was received for the year ended december 31, 2018.
easements and sundry income. easements and sundry income was $63.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, a slight decrease compared to $64.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. easements and sundry income includes pipeline easement income, seismic and temporary permit income, lease rental income and income from material sales. easements and sundry income is unpredictable and may vary significantly from period to period. the slight decrease in easements and sundry income is principally related to a decrease in material sales, partially offset by an increase in pipeline easement income. material sales decreased 22.3% to $5.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the same period of 2017. pipeline easement income increased 3.7% to $43.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. effective january 1, 2018, upon the trust's adoption of the new revenue recognition
accounting standard, we no longer defer revenue on our term easements. see note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies - recent accounting pronouncements" in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion and analysis of impact on our consolidated financial statements.

water sales and royalties. water sales and royalty revenues for the year ended december 31, 2018 of $63.9 million were more than double the amount of revenue for the comparable period of 2017. this increase is due primarily to the trust commencing the development of brackish water sourcing, partially offset by a decrease in the royalties received from existing legacy agreements.
easements and sundry income. easements and sundry income for the water service and operations segment includes pipeline easement royalties, commercial lease royalties and income from temporary permits. for the year ended december 31, 2018, the combined revenue from these revenue streams was $24.8 million as compared to $5.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017.

other financial data - consolidated salaries and related employee expenses. salaries and related employee expenses were $18.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $3.8 million for the comparable period of 2018. the increase in salaries and related employee expenses is directly related to the increase in the number of employees from 26 employees as of december 31, 2017 to 64 as of december 31, 2018 as well as an increase in contract labor expenses over the same time period.
water service-related expenses. water service-related expenses of $11.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, include expenses for equipment rental, propane and fuel and other equipment-related expenses associated with brackish water sourcing and water re-use projects placed in service in 2018 and late 2017. the trust incurred only minimal water service-related expenses during the year ended december 31, 2017.
general and administrative expenses. general and administrative expenses increased $3.2 million to $4.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 from $1.5 million for the same period of 2017. the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to additional liability insurance and equipment costs as a result of the formation and commencement of operations of tpwr during the second quarter of 2017.

effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our operating results. we cannot assure you, however, that future increases in our costs will not occur or that any such increases that may occur will not adversely affect our results of operations.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. it is our opinion that we fully disclose our significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. consistent with our disclosure policies, we include the following discussion related to what we believe to be our most critical accounting policies that require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgment.
accrual of oil and gas royalties the trust accrues oil and gas royalties. an accrual is necessary due to the time lag between the production of oil and gas and generation of the actual payment by operators. the oil and gas royalty accrual is based upon historical payments, estimates of the timing of future payments and recent market prices for oil and gas.
gain recognition on land sales any gain or loss on the sale of land is calculated in accordance with gaap. the trust has established policies for the sale of land which result in the full accrual method of gain recognition. this policy generally requires that the trust receive a minimum cash down payment of 25% of the sales price on each sale and that any related notes receivable require regular principal and interest payments, payable over terms from 5 to 15 years.

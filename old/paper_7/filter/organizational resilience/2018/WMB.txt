selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to the absence of severance-related, organizational realignment, and financial repositioning costs incurred in 2017, $25 million in reduced costs associated with our former gulf olefins and four corners area operations, and ongoing cost containment efforts. these decreases are partially offset by a charitable contribution of preferred stock to the williams companies foundation, inc. (see note 15 - stockholders' equity of notes to consolidated financial statements) and fees associated with the wpz merger.
selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to the absence of certain project development costs associated with the canadian pdh facility that were expensed in 2016, lower labor-related costs resulting from our workforce reductions that occurred late in first-quarter 2016, ongoing cost containment efforts, lower strategic development costs, and the absence of costs associated with our former canadian and gulf olefins operations. these decreases were partially offset by higher severance and organizational realignment costs in 2017 (see note 7 - other income and expenses of notes to consolidated financial statements).
distributions from equity-method investees the organizational documents of entities in which we have an equity-method investment generally require distribution of their available cash to their members on a quarterly basis. in each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating their respective businesses. (see note 6 - investing activities of notes to consolidated financial statements for our more significant equity-method investees.)

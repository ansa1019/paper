table of contents organization of information management's discussion and analysis provides a narrative on the company's financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements. it includes the following sections:
•   business segment results - 2018 vs. 2017
•   business segment results - 2017 vs. 2016
•   impact of u.s. federal income tax reform
•   significant developments
•   liquidity and capital resources
•   contractual obligations, commitments and off balance sheet arrangements
revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 8%, or $4.3 billion, to $59.4 billion; net income attributable to disney increased 40%, or $3.6 billion, to $12.6 billion; and diluted earnings per share attributable to disney (eps) increased 47%, or $2.67 to $8.36. the eps increase in fiscal 2018 was due to a benefit from new federal income tax legislation, the "tax cuts and jobs act" (tax act) (see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements), higher segment operating income, a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program and gains on the sale of real estate and property rights. these increases were partially offset by the comparison to a non-cash net gain in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in bamtech in the prior year, impairments of our vice and villages nature equity method investments in the current year and higher net interest and corporate and unallocated shared expenses. the increase in segment operating income was due to growth at our parks and resorts and studio entertainment segments, partially offset by lower results at our media networks and consumer products & interactive media segments. in addition, net income attributable to disney reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decline due to the movement of the u.s. dollar against major currencies including the impact of our hedging program (fx impact).
revenues service revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 9%, or $4.0 billion, to $50.9 billion, due to higher theatrical distribution revenue, growth in guest spending and volumes at our parks and resorts, an increase in affiliate fees, increased tv/svod distribution revenue and the consolidation of bamtech. on september 25, 2017, the company increased its ownership in bamtech and began consolidating its results. these increases were partially offset by lower advertising revenue.
product revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 3%, or $0.3 billion, to $8.6 billion, due to guest spending and volume growth at our parks and resorts, partially offset by lower home entertainment volumes and a decrease in retail store sales. product revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point increase due to a favorable fx impact.
costs and expenses cost of services for fiscal 2018 increased 9%, or $2.2 billion, to $27.5 billion, due to higher film and television cost amortization driven by an increase in theatrical and tv/svod distribution revenue and contractual rate increases for television programming. costs of services also increased due to the consolidation of bamtech and higher costs at our parks and resorts reflecting cost inflation, higher technology and operations support expenses and a special fiscal 2018 domestic employee bonus.
cost of products for fiscal 2018 increased 4%, or $0.2 billion, to $5.2 billion, due to cost inflation and higher guest spending and volumes at our parks and resorts. cost of products reflected an approximate 1 percentage point increase due to an unfavorable fx impact.
table of contents selling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2018 increased 8%, or $0.7 billion, to $8.9 billion, due to higher marketing spend, the consolidation of bamtech, costs incurred in connection with the 21cf acquisition and an increase in compensation costs.
depreciation and amortization costs increased 8%, or $0.2 billion, to $3.0 billion due to depreciation of new attractions at our parks and resorts segment and the consolidation of bamtech. depreciation and amortization costs reflected an approximate 1 percentage point increase due to an unfavorable fx impact.

the decrease in interest and investment income for the year was due to the comparison to gains on investments recognized in the prior year, partially offset by an increase in interest income driven by higher average interest rates.
equity in the income of investees equity in the income of investees decreased $422 million, to a loss of $102 million due to higher losses from hulu, impairments of vice and villages nature equity method investments and lower income from a+e. these decreases were partially offset by a favorable comparison to a loss from bamtech in the prior year. the decrease at hulu was driven by higher programming, labor and marketing costs, partially offset by growth in subscription and advertising revenue. the decrease at a+e was due to lower advertising revenue and higher programming costs, partially offset by higher program sales.

effective income tax rate   11.3   %      32.1   %   20.8                   ppt the decrease in the effective income tax rate was due to the impact of the tax act, which included:
•   a net benefit of $1.7 billion, which reflected a $2.1 billion benefit from remeasuring our deferred tax balances to the new statutory rate (deferred remeasurement), partially offset by a charge of $0.4 billion for a one-time tax on certain accumulated foreign earnings (deemed repatriation tax). this benefit had an impact of approximately 11.5 percentage points on the effective income tax rate.
•   a reduction in the company's fiscal 2018 u.s. statutory federal income tax rate to 24.5% from 35.0% in the prior year. net of state tax and other related effects, the reduction in the statutory rate had an impact of approximately 8.2 percentage points on the effective income tax rate.
noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year increased $82 million to $468 million due to lower tax expense at espn, largely due to the tax act, and the impact of the company's acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in disneyland paris in the third quarter of the prior year. these increases were partially offset by losses at bamtech.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties and management fees, financing costs and income taxes, as applicable.
revenues for fiscal 2017 decreased 1%, or $0.5 billion, to $55.1 billion; net income attributable to disney decreased 4%, or $0.4 billion, to $9.0 billion; and eps for the year decreased 1%, or $0.04 to $5.69. the eps decrease in fiscal 2017 was due to lower segment operating income at media networks, studio entertainment and consumer products & interactive media and higher net interest expense. these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program, higher operating income at parks and resorts and a decrease in the effective tax rate. in addition, net income attributable to disney reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decline due to an unfavorable fx impact.
revenues service revenues for fiscal 2017 decreased 1%, or $0.3 billion, to $46.8 billion, due to declines from theatrical and home entertainment distribution, advertising and merchandise licensing. these decreases were partially offset by the benefit from a full year of operations at shanghai disney resort, which opened in june 2016, an increase in affiliate fees and higher average guest spending and attendance at our other parks and resorts. service revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decline due to an unfavorable fx impact.
product revenues for fiscal 2017 decreased 2%, or $0.2 billion, to $8.3 billion, due to lower volumes at our home entertainment distribution and retail businesses and the discontinuation of infinity, partially offset by the impact of a full year of operations at shanghai disney resort and higher average guest spending and volumes at our other parks and resorts. product revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decline due to an unfavorable fx impact.
costs and expenses cost of services for fiscal 2017 increased 3%, or $0.7 billion, to $25.3 billion, due to higher sports programming costs, a full year of operations at shanghai disney resort and new guest offerings and inflation at our other parks and resorts. these increases were partially offset by lower film cost amortization and theatrical distribution costs.
cost of products for fiscal 2017 decreased 7%, or $0.4 billion, to $5.0 billion, due to the discontinuation of infinity, the absence of the infinity charge (see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements) and lower retail and home entertainment volumes. these decreases were partially offset by a full year of operations at shanghai disney resort and inflation at our domestic parks and resorts.
table of contents selling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2017 decreased 7%, or $0.6 billion, to $8.2 billion, due to lower theatrical marketing costs and the discontinuation of infinity. selling, general, administrative and other costs reflected an approximate 1 percentage point benefit due to a favorable fx impact.
depreciation and amortization costs increased 10%, or $0.3 billion, to $2.8 billion primarily due to a full year of operations at shanghai disney resort and depreciation associated with new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts.
restructuring and impairment charges the company recorded $98 million and $156 million of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. charges in fiscal 2017 were due to severance costs and asset impairments. charges in fiscal 2016 were due to asset impairments and severance and contract termination costs.

the increase in interest expense was due to higher average debt balances, lower capitalized interest and an increase in our effective interest rate.
equity in the income of investees equity in the income of investees decreased 65% or $606 million, to $0.3 billion due to the comparison to the $332 million vice gain (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), which was recognized in fiscal 2016, and higher losses from our investments in bamtech and hulu. the bamtech results reflected a valuation adjustment to sports programming rights that were prepaid prior to our acquisition of bamtech and increased costs for technology platform investments. the decrease at hulu was due to higher programming, distribution, marketing and labor costs, partially offset by growth in advertising and subscription revenues.
2017                                          2016       change better/(worse)
effective income tax rate   32.1   %      34.2   %   2.1                     ppt the decrease in the effective income tax rate was due to lower tax on foreign earnings, a favorable impact from the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement related to the tax impact of employee share-based awards ($125 million) and an increase in the benefit related to qualified domestic production activities. these decreases were partially offset by a benefit in the prior year from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. the lower tax on foreign earnings was driven by a decrease in foreign losses for which we are not recognizing a tax benefit.
noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2017 decreased $13 million to $386 million due to the impact of lower net income at espn, partially offset by the impact of improved results at shanghai disney resort.

the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the overall performance of the operating businesses. aggregate segment operating income is not a financial measure defined by gaap, should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant gaap financial measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. the company believes that information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the company's portfolio of businesses separate from factors other than business operations that affect net income.

revenues the increase in affiliate fees was due to an increase of 7% from higher contractual rates, partially offset by a decrease of 2% from fewer subscribers.

•   for the year ended september 29, 2018, the company recognized a net benefit of $1.7 billion, which reflected a $2.1 billion benefit from the deferred remeasurement, partially offset by a charge of $0.4 billion for the deemed repatriation tax.
•   generally, there will no longer be a u.s. federal income tax cost on the repatriation of foreign earnings.
•   the company will generally be eligible to claim an immediate deduction for investments in qualified fixed assets acquired and film and television productions that commenced after september 27, 2017 and are placed in service during fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2022. this provision phases out through fiscal 2027.
•   certain provisions of the act are not effective for the company until fiscal 2019 including:
•   the elimination of the domestic production activities deduction.
•   the taxation of certain foreign derived income in the u.s. at an effective rate of approximately 13% (which increases to approximately 16% in 2025) rather than the general statutory rate of 21%.
•   a minimum effective tax on certain foreign earnings of approximately 13%.
we are continuing to assess the impacts of these provisions to our fiscal 2019 effective income tax rate.
•   we expect a cash tax benefit similar to the reduction in the statutory rate, as well as a benefit from the immediate deduction for investments in qualified fixed assets and film and television productions.
the u.s. treasury and other tax authorities continue to issue guidance impacting the application of the tax act on the company, and accordingly, our analysis of the impact of the tax act is not final.
significant developments during fiscal 2018, the company launched espn+ and continued the development of disney+, which is scheduled to launch in the u.s. in late 2019. as we intend to use certain of our film and television content on the disney+ service, in the short term we expect to forgo certain licensing revenue from the sale of this content to third parties. in addition, we anticipate an increase in programming and production investments to create exclusive content for the dtc services.
in fiscal 2018, the company announced a strategic reorganization of its businesses into the following operating segments: the newly-formed direct-to-consumer and international segment; the combined parks, experiences and consumer products segment; media networks; and studio entertainment. the company is in the process of modifying internal reporting processes and systems to accommodate the new structure and will report under the new segment structure in fiscal 2019. the chief operating decision maker received information and assessed performance during 2018 based on historic operating segments.

operating activities cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2018 increased 16% or $2.0 billion to $14.3 billion compared to fiscal 2017 due to a decrease in tax payments resulting from the tax act, a decrease in pension plan contributions and higher operating cash flows at studio entertainment and parks and resorts, partially offset by lower operating cash flow at media networks and a payment for the rights to develop a real estate property in new york. the increase in operating cash flow at studio entertainment was due to higher operating cash receipts driven by an increase in revenue, partially offset by higher operating cash disbursements driven by higher marketing expenses. parks and resorts cash flow reflected higher operating cash receipts due to increased revenue, partially offset by higher spending on labor and other costs. lower operating cash flow at media networks was due to higher television production spending.
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017 decreased 6% or $0.8 billion to $12.3 billion compared to fiscal 2016 due to a decrease in operating cash flow at studio entertainment and an increase in pension plan contributions, partially offset by higher operating cash flow at parks and resorts and lower tax payments. the decrease in operating cash flow at studio entertainment was due to lower operating cash receipts driven by a decrease in revenue and higher film production spending. parks and resorts cash flow reflected higher operating cash receipts due to increased revenues, partially offset by higher payments for labor and other costs.

table of contents film and television costs the company's studio entertainment and media networks segments incur costs to acquire and produce feature film and television programming. film and television production costs include all internally produced content such as live-action and animated feature films, animated direct-to-video programming, television series, television specials, theatrical stage plays or other similar product. programming costs include film or television product licensed for a specific period from third parties for airing on the company's broadcast, cable networks and television stations. programming assets are generally recorded when the programming becomes available to us with a corresponding increase in programming liabilities. accordingly, we analyze our programming assets net of the related liability.
change in film and television production andprogramming costs             523               1,075                 101
investing activities investing activities consist principally of investments in parks, resorts and other property and acquisition and divestiture activity. the company's investments in parks, resorts and other property for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:
media networks cable networks                                       $202                 $75                 $86
capital expenditures for the parks and resorts segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion, new attractions, cruise ships, capital improvements and systems infrastructure. the increase at our domestic parks and resorts in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to spending on new attractions at walt disney world resort and disneyland
table of contents resort, while the increase in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was due to spending on new attractions at disneyland resort. the decrease in capital expenditures at our international parks and resorts in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was due to lower spending at shanghai disney resort and hong kong disneyland resort.
capital expenditures at media networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities and television station facilities. the increase at cable networks in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to spending at bamtech.
capital expenditures at corporate primarily reflect investments in corporate facilities, information technology infrastructure and equipment.
the company currently expects its fiscal 2019 capital expenditures will be approximately $1 billion higher than fiscal 2018 capital expenditures of $4.5 billion due to increased investments at our domestic and international parks and resorts.
other investing activities the fiscal 2018 spending of $1.6 billion on acquisitions was for the september 2017 acquisition of bamtech. cash provided by other investing activities of $710 million reflected $1.2 billion of cash received in connection with the sales of real estate and property rights, partially offset by contributions of $442 million to a joint venture.
the fiscal 2017 spending of $417 million on acquisitions was for the january 2017 acquisition of additional interests in bamtech for $557 million, partially offset by $140 million of cash assumed upon the consolidation of bamtech. cash used in other investing activities of $71 million reflected $266 million of contributions to joint ventures and investment purchases, partially offset by $173 million of proceeds from investment dispositions.
the fiscal 2016 spending of $850 million on acquisitions was for a 15% interest in bamtech and an 11% interest in vice. cash used in other investing activities of $135 million reflected $109 million of contributions to joint ventures and investment purchases and $74 million in premiums paid for foreign currency option contracts in connection with our commitment to acquire two new cruise ships.
financing activities cash used in financing activities was $8.8 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $9.0 billion in fiscal 2017. the net use of cash in the current year was due to $3.6 billion of common stock repurchases, $2.5 billion in dividends and a net repayment of borrowings of $2.6 billion. cash used in financing activities was comparable to fiscal 2017 as lower common stock repurchases ($3.6 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $9.4 billion in fiscal 2017) and higher contributions from noncontrolling interest holders of $0.4 billion was essentially offset by a net repayment of borrowings in the current year compared to a net increase in borrowings in the prior year ($2.6 billion decrease in fiscal 2018 compared to $3.7 billion increase in fiscal 2017).
cash used in financing activities was $9.0 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $7.2 billion in fiscal 2016. the net use of cash in fiscal 2017 was due to $9.4 billion of common stock repurchases, $2.4 billion in dividends and $0.8 billion in payments to noncontrolling interest holders, partially offset by net borrowings of $3.7 billion. the increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was due to higher common stock repurchases ($9.4 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $7.5 billion in fiscal 2016).
table of contents during the year ended september 29, 2018, the company's borrowing activity was as follows:
(1)   borrowings and reductions of borrowings are reported net.
(2)   the other activity is due to market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges.
see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company's bank facilities. the company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities, in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due.
see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the company's dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016.
we believe that the company's financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund the cash consideration in the pending acquisition of 21cf, ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. however, the company's operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. in addition to macroeconomic factors, the company's borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the company's performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. as of september 29, 2018, moody's investors service's long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a2 and p-1, respectively, standard and poor's long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a+ and a-1, and fitch's long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a and f1, respectively. each of moody's investors service, standard and poor's and fitch had placed the company's long- and short-term debt ratings on review for downgrade as a result of the pending acquisition of 21cf. on october 8, 2018, moody's investor service affirmed the company's long- and short-term debt ratings of a2 and p-1, respectively, following its review of the impact of the acquisition. the company currently expects standard and poor's and fitch to finalize its review of the company's debt ratings upon closing of the acquisition and one or more of the agencies may downgrade our long and short-term debt ratings. should a downgrade occur, we do not anticipate that it would impact our ability to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures. the company's bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the company met on september 29, 2018, by a significant margin. the company's bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the asia theme parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default.
contractual obligations, commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the company has various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. for example, the company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at september 29, 2018 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. in addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings based on their contractual maturities.
table of contents additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, as referenced in the table:

(1)   excludes market value adjustments, which reduce recorded borrowings by $304 million. includes interest payments based on contractual terms for fixed rate debt and on current interest rates for variable rate debt. in 2023, the company has the ability to call a debt instrument prior to its scheduled maturity, which if exercised by the company would reduce future interest payments by $1.0 billion.
(2)   other commitments primarily comprise contracts for the construction of three new cruise ships, creative talent and employment agreements and unrecognized tax benefits. creative talent and employment agreements include obligations to actors, producers, sports, television and radio personalities and executives.
the company also has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement medical benefit plans. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
contingent commitments and contractual guarantees see notes 3, 6 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company's contingent commitments and contractual guarantees.
legal and tax matters as disclosed in notes 9 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the company has exposure for certain tax and legal matters.
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. for a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
film and television revenues and costs we expense film and television production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (ultimate revenues) for each production. if our estimate of ultimate revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. conversely, if our estimate of ultimate revenues increases, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. for film productions, ultimate revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release. for television series, ultimate revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.
with respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is theatrical performance. revenues derived from
table of contents other markets subsequent to the theatrical release (e.g., the home entertainment or television markets) have historically been highly correlated with the theatrical performance. theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. upon a film's release and determination of the theatrical performance, the company's estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for released films is the level of expected home entertainment sales. home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home entertainment products, as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products.
with respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of ultimate revenues are program ratings and the strength of the advertising market. program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the company's ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program. in addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the licensing of program rights worldwide to television distributors, svod services and in home entertainment formats. alternatively, poor ratings may result in cancellation of the program, which would require an immediate write-down of any unamortized production costs. a significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates.
we expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired series, movies and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life, as appropriate. amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. the number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program's ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. we amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. the estimated value of each year is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. if the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season's estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. if planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.
costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments, which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. the net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. the company's dayparts are: primetime, daytime, late night, news and sports (includes broadcast and cable networks). the net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable network. individual programs are written off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program. estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required.
revenue recognition the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies.
we reduce home entertainment revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives. these estimates are based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products. if we underestimate the level of returns or sales incentives in a particular period, we may record less revenue in later periods when returns or sales incentives exceed the estimated amount. conversely, if we overestimate the level of returns or sales incentives for a period, we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns or sales incentives are less than estimated.
pension and postretirement medical plan actuarial assumptions the company's pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. the guideline for
table of contents setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. we increased our discount rate to 4.31% at the end of fiscal 2018 from 3.88% at the end of fiscal 2017 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2018 year end measurement date. the company's discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of plans' liability cash flows to the yield curves. a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2019 by approximately $241 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at september 29, 2018 by approximately $2.7 billion. a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $229 million and $2.3 billion, respectively.
to determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. our expected return on plan assets is 7.50%. a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense, while a higher expected rate of return on pension plan assets will decrease pension expense. a one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2019 annual benefit expense by approximately $135 million.
goodwill, other intangible assets, long-lived assets and investments the company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
to determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. the discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. we include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value. we believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.
in times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the company's long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.
the company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.
the company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. the impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying value of the asset group. an asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. if the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group's long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group's long-lived assets. the impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. for assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset's fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. if we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.
the company has cost and equity investments. the fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. in assessing the potential impairment of these investments, we consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and
table of contents market values, where available. if these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value, impairment charges may be required.
the company tested its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, long-lived assets and investments for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $210 million, $22 million and $7 million in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the fiscal 2018 impairment charges were recorded in "equity in the income (loss) of investees, net" in the consolidated statements of income. the fiscal 2017 and 2016 impairment charges were recorded in "restructuring and impairment charges" in the consolidated statements of income.
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. in times of domestic or global economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods.
contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings. these estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate. from time to time, we may also be involved in other contingent matters for which we have accrued estimates for a probable and estimable loss. it is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.
income tax audits as a matter of course, the company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. the tax benefits ultimately realized by the company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the company's decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the company's success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.
new accounting pronouncements see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.
forward-looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. we may from time to time make written or oral statements that are "forward-looking," including statements contained in this report and other filings with the sec and in reports to our shareholders. such statements may, for example, express expectations or projections about future actions that we may take, including restructuring or strategic initiatives, or about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions. these statements are made on the basis of management's views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements. there can be no assurance, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass. significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under item 1a - risk factors of this report on form 10-k.

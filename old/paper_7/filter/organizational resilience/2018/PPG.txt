● slightly higher acquisition-related sales, net of dispositions
● slightly favorable foreign currency translation u.s. and canada net sales increased a low-single-digit percentage primarily driven by net sales from acquired businesses which added approximately $110 million, primarily from the crown group, as well as higher selling prices in most businesses.
europe, middle east and africa (emea) net sales increased a mid-single-digit percentage, led by slightly positive sales volumes, higher selling prices in all businesses and favorable foreign currency translation driven by the euro and u.k. pound.
asia pacific net sales increased by a mid-single-digit percentage aided by higher selling prices in most businesses and higher sales volumes, slightly offset by weakening industry demand in china later in the year. sales growth was also supported by a more than 10% increase in india and solid gains in australia and southeast asia. net sales in this region also benefited from favorable foreign currency translation.
latin american net sales volumes grew by a mid-single-digit percentage versus the prior year. sales also benefited from higher selling prices in the region, offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation driven by the mexican peso.
for specific business results see the segment results section within item 7 of this form 10-k.
● slightly higher selling prices net sales from acquired businesses added over $200 million of sales in 2017, primarily metokote, deutek, univer and the crown group.
u.s. and canada sales volumes declined slightly year-over-year, with mixed demand by business and end-use segment. sales volumes in architectural coatings u.s. company-owned stores grew by a mid-single-digit percentage, but were more than offset by sales volumes declines in the independent dealer networks and national retail (diy) customer accounts in aggregate. automotive oem coatings sales volumes declined year-over-year and lagged industry demand levels due to a customer-driven share shift away from ppg that was offset in other regions of the world. these decreases in sales volumes were partially offset by higher sales volumes in specialty coatings and materials, automotive refinish coatings, general industrial coatings, aerospace coatings and packaging coatings.
emea sales volumes increased a low-single-digit percentage versus the prior year. sales volumes in our automotive oem coatings and aerospace coatings businesses each grew by a mid-single-digit percentage. specialty coatings and materials sales volumes grew by a double-digit percentage, driven by strong silica demand. protective coatings volumes also grew year-over-year. these increases in sales volumes were partially offset by lower demand in architectural coatings.
28 2018 ppg annual report and 10-k asia pacific sales volumes expanded by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year led by growth in each business within the industrial coatings segment along with sales volume growth in the architectural coatings business. these increases in sales volumes were partially offset by lower demand in marine coatings year-over-year. from a country and sub-region perspective, sales volumes grew in india, china, and southeast asia versus the prior year. korea sales volumes continued to decline year-over-year primarily due to continued weakness in new shipbuilding.
latin america sales volumes expanded by a mid-single-digit percentage versus the prior year primarily due to above market growth in our automotive oem coatings and general industrial coatings businesses. the automotive oem coatings growth was driven by industry production expansion with the opening of new assembly facilities in mexico. regional sales volumes were lower in architectural coatings versus the prior year primarily due to lower sales volumes in brazil and in mexico due to the impact of the natural disasters during the third quarter.

$ change                                % change
performance coatings net sales increased (4%) due to the following:
higher selling prices across all businesses were achieved, reflecting the value of our products and services and which offset persistent raw material and logistics cost inflation.
architectural coatings - americas and asia-pacific sales volumes decreased by a low-single-digit percentage versus the prior year. sales volumes were positive year-over-year in the u.s. and canada company-owned store network as well as in mexico, central america, australia and brazil. this growth was more than offset by lower diy and independent dealer network channel declines, including the unfavorable impact from a customer assortment change in the u.s. architectural diy channel. in february 2018, ppg announced that lowe's would discontinue the sale of olympic® brand paints and stains in its u.s. retail stores, effective mid-2018. during the second quarter 2018, the company launched its olympic® stain products at the home depot®'s u.s. retail stores, expanding an existing partnership arrangement. the net impact of these customer assortment changes resulted in net sales being lower by approximately $100 million in 2018.
architectural coatings - emea net sales grew by a mid-single digit percentage. higher selling prices and acquisition-related sales more than offset modestly lower sales volumes. sales volumes grew in countries in northern and eastern europe and were lower in southern europe.
automotive refinish coatings organic sales grew by a low-single-digit percentage year-over-year, despite lower demand in the u.s. due to customer inventory destocking and lower industry collision claim activity. organic sales increased in all other geographic regions as customers continued to adopt ppg's industry leading technologies.
aerospace coatings sales volumes grew by more than 10 percent versus the prior year, including above-market volume growth in the u.s. and asia. strong growth was supported by positive industry demand fundamentals and market outperformance in all major platforms stemming from technology advantaged products.
protective and marine coatings sales volumes increased by a high-single-digit percentage year-over-year. protective coatings sales volumes were up a mid-single-digit percentage, driven by growth in china. marine coatings sales volumes grew by more than 10 percent off a low sales base as ship building activity grew modestly in asia.
segment income decreased $13 million year-over-year primarily driven by increasing raw material and logistics costs. these cost increases were partially offset by higher selling prices and additional benefits from the company's restructuring programs. favorable foreign currency translation increased segment income by approximately $15 million, primarily related to the strengthening of the euro.
performance coatings net sales increased (2%) due to the following:
● modest foreign currency translation partially offset by:
● slightly lower sales volumes selling prices increased year-over-year primarily due to selling price initiatives across all businesses to combat accelerating raw material cost inflation.
the unfavorable impact from natural disasters in the third quarter 2017. this increase was more than offset by sales volume declines in the u.s. and canada independent dealer networks and national retail (diy) customer accounts, as both distribution channels continued to experience soft demand. organic sales improved in both the latin america and asia pacific regions.
architectural coatings - emea net sales increased by a high-single-digit percentage year-over-year, primarily due to acquisition-related sales, principally deutek and univer, which contributed approximately $85 million to net sales. sales volumes were down year-over-year primarily driven by continued weak demand in france and eastern europe, as well as our turning away certain business due to low profitability or lack of customer acceptance of selling price increases. demand growth continued in northern europe, where we continued to outperform the market.
automotive refinish coatings organic sales grew by a low-single-digit percentage year-over-year, led by above-market performance in u.s. and canada as customers continued to adopt ppg's industry leading technologies. organic sales also increased in the latin american region versus the prior year, reflecting high end-use market demand. in asia pacific, net sales increased, largely due to the recent futian xinshi acquisition in china.
aerospace coatings sales volumes grew by a low-single-digit percentage versus the prior year, led by above market performance in europe and consistent with the overall industry demand.
protective and marine coatings sales volumes declined by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year. protective coatings sales volumes expanded in most regions, led by europe, but were more than offset by significant weakness in new shipbuilding activity, primarily in the asia pacific region.
segment income decreased $9 million year-over-year primarily due increasing raw material costs, wage and other cost inflation, and lower sales volumes partially offset by selling price increases, lower overhead and manufacturing costs, including the initial benefits from business restructuring actions.
looking ahead looking ahead, year-over-year raw material cost inflation is expected in the first half of 2019, primarily due to carry-over inflation. acquisition related sales are forecast to add a low-single-digit percentage of sales growth primarily from the sem acquisition and based on current exchange rates, we expect foreign currency translation to have an unfavorable impact on segment sales of approximately $100 million in the first quarter.
additionally, further selling price increases are expected in 2019 as we continue to offset the cumulative impact of raw material inflation over the past nine quarters. net sales are expected to be lower in the first half compared to 2018 driven by lower u.s. diy sales of approximately $110 million due to the customer assortment changes that occurred in 2018. the impact will be larger than the impact realized in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to the seasonality of the u.s. diy business.
$ change                                % change
selling prices increased sequentially throughout the year and were up approximately 1.5 percent year-over-year primarily driven by the general industrial and packaging businesses.
industrial coatings sales volumes continued to grow led by strong outperformance in coil, heavy-duty equipment and electronics materials. from a geographic perspective, sales volume growth was led by emea and latin america. acquisition-related sales from the crown group added approximately $100 million in sales during the year.
packaging coatings sales volumes were up a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year driven by continued customer adoption of ppg's new can coating technologies. from a geographic perspective, sales volumes in the developed regions grew a high-single-digit percentage, offset by a low-single-digit percentage decrease in the asia pacific region.
ppg's automotive oem coatings sales volumes were slightly lower versus the prior year, consistent with the global automotive industry growth rate. in the second half of the year, automotive oem production fell sharply in china and new emission standards negatively impacted production in europe.
segment income decreased $161 million year-over-year primarily due to continuing, significant raw material and logistics cost inflation, partially offset by higher selling prices and lower manufacturing costs, including benefits from business restructuring actions. favorable foreign currency translation added approximately $5 million to segment income.
partially offset by:
ppg's automotive oem coatings sales volumes increased by a low-single-digit percentage versus the prior year, consistent with the global automotive industry production growth rate, led by china, mexico, europe and brazil. sales volumes declined in the u.s. and canada, partially reflecting fewer automotive new builds.
general industrial coatings and specialty coatings and materials sales volumes, in aggregate, grew by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year. sales volumes grew year-over-year in every major region with mixed demand by end-use and geography. this growth was led by asia pacific and the u.s., which outpaced regional industrial production demand growth. sales volumes grew across most segments, including year-over-year increases in electronics materials, heavy duty equipment and organic light emitting diode (oled) materials. acquisition-related sales, primarily metokote, added approximately $155 million.
segment income decreased $81 million year-over-year primarily due to increasing raw material costs, lower selling prices and wage and other cost inflation. these cost increases were partially offset by income from higher sales volumes, lower manufacturing and overhead costs, including the initial benefits from business restructuring actions, and acquisition-related income.
looking ahead looking ahead, we expect that greater volatility in global industrial demand will continue through the first quarter of 2019 with inconsistencies by region. the carryover impact from 2018 cost inflation and significantly unfavorable foreign currency translation will impact first quarter earnings. the company will continue to prioritize implementing selling price increases and operating margin recovery.
global automotive oem industry demand is expected to remain soft in the first quarter for most major regions with greater volatility expected in china. we anticipate that aggregate global general industrial demand growth will continue, but at a more moderate rate than in the first quarter of 2019. in addition, we expect that the whitford acquisition will close during the latter portion of the first quarter, pending required regulatory approvals, and therefore will not provide meaningful sales or earnings benefit in the quarter. in addition, we expect packaging sales volumes to moderate as the pace of technology conversions slow in 2019.
review and outlook during 2018, economic conditions were generally positive in all of our major geographical regions while remaining mixed by end-uses. ppg's aggregate organic sales grew approximately 3% versus the prior year. acquisition-related sales from two acquisitions completed in 2017 and the four completed in 2018 contributed approximately 1% to net sales growth year-over-year, net of dispositions. foreign currency translation was favorable for the first half of the year then turned unfavorable in the second half of the year. for the full year 2018, foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by approximately 1%. raw material inflation was elevated throughout the year and overall rose a mid-single digit percentage driven by supply related factors, including government mandated production curtailments in china to help improve pollution and higher oil prices. in addition, logistics costs were significantly higher in 2018 driven by higher oil prices and shortages in the availability in transportation.
u.s. and canada during 2018, the pace of economic activity improved in the u.s. and canada region versus the prior year, led by stronger gdp growth in the u.s. despite flat automotive industry builds. demand in the residential and commercial construction markets was modestly higher in 2018 compared to 2017. new home starts advanced approximately 4% in 2018 versus approximately 3% in 2017. residential remodeling was flat in 2018 versus 2017, while commercial construction was flat compared to a 1% decline in 2017. market demand for architectural paint continued to shift more to the professional trade painters channel as the continued decline in u.s. unemployment resulted in consumers choosing professional painters rather than completing projects themselves. demand in u.s. do-it-yourself (diy) paint stores continued to remain soft throughout the year consistent with 2017. ppg's architectural coatings performance in the u.s. and canada was impacted by diy customer assortment changes that unfavorably impacted sales by approximately $100 million. the automotive refinish coatings business was impacted by lower collision rates and a higher number of automobiles in accidents being totaled rather than repainted offsetting modest growth in miles driven. ppg's packaging coatings business continued to expand well ahead of the industry driven by continued strong sales growth momentum related to customer adoption of ppg's new interior can coatings technologies. ppg's automotive oem coatings business performance was slightly better than industry demand levels due to modest share gains. the u.s. and canada region remained ppg's largest, representing approximately 42% of 2018 sales, although a smaller percentage of total sales than in the prior year.
europe, middle east and africa european economic activity was mixed in 2018. industrial production was higher in the first half of the year and moderated as the year progressed. the region was impacted by continuing uncertainty over the united kingdom's exit from the european union. overall gdp and industrial production were similar to 2017 in the region. regional demand continued to be mixed by country and end-uses. demand for ppg's products in several end-uses drove the regional growth rate, including above market performance in general industrial coatings, packaging coatings and specialty coatings and materials. ppg's architectural coatings - emea business sales volumes decreased year-over-year, driven by soft demand in southern europe.
emea represented approximately 30% of ppg's 2018 sales, similar to prior year levels. regional coatings volumes remain approximately 15% below their pre-recession levels in 2008. the modest volume recovery reflects the slow pace of economic growth in the region. ppg expects modest volume growth over time at attractive incremental margins due to significant cost structure improvements and available capacity to satisfy additional demand. in the second half of the year, the euro and british pound both depreciated against the u.s. dollar.
asia pacific and latin america the emerging regions of asia pacific and latin america represented 28% of ppg's 2018 sales in aggregate, similar to the prior year.
36 2018 ppg annual report and 10-k asia remained the largest emerging region, with sales of approximately $2.5 billion, led by china, which continued as ppg's second largest country by revenue. the performance coatings segment led sales volume growth in asia, in part due to strong sales volume growth in protective and marine coatings, aerospace coatings, and automotive refinish coatings. these increases were partially offset by a decline in automotive oem coatings, particularly in china where industry retail automobile sales fell for the first time in over 25 years.
overall, demand in latin america improved year-over-year for the second consecutive year, with continued above market growth in mexico and central america. economic conditions were mixed in south america, and there was heightened currency volatility throughout the entire region. in mexico, the ppg-comex business added over 200 new concessionaire locations. the overall region's performance was supported by strong growth in the general industrial and packaging coatings businesses. foreign currency translation was volatile and finished 4 percent unfavorable compared to 2017, principally the mexican peso and brazilian real.
outlook looking ahead to 2019, we expect global market growth to continue, but we expect a downshift in the pace of growth, and it will likely be uneven by region and end-use. we expect most regional growth rates to be modestly lower than 2018, but the latin america region growth rate to be slightly higher.
we anticipate ppg's u.s. and canada regional growth will be led by general industrial coatings and aerospace coatings, with flat automotive industry builds. we expect growth in housing and commercial construction to be comparable to 2018.
we expect demand in europe to grow but at lower levels than 2018. regional growth is expected to remain mixed by sub-region and country. favorable end-use trends are expected to continue in general industrial and packaging with flattening demand in automotive oem coatings as industry growth rates are anticipated to be flat. demand is expected to stay subdued in the architectural coatings business. we continue to monitor the economic environment in the u.k. as their exit from the european union progresses and impacts consumer sentiment and coatings demand.
in asia pacific, we expect continued industrial production growth in china, southeast asia and india. in china, we foresee continued above global average growth with heightened risk as the chinese economy continues to shift and rely more on domestic consumption. the sharp decline in automotive oem activity seen in the second half of 2018 is expected to continue in the beginning of 2019. we expect year-over-year demand patterns to become more favorable in the second half of 2019. the recovery in marine coatings demand is expected to continue, albeit off a low base.
in latin america, we anticipate economic expansion will continue in mexico, most of central america and south america.
significant other factors in may 2018, ppg initiated an $83 million global restructuring program. the program is largely centered around the change in customer assortment related to the u.s. architectural coatings diy business. ppg recognized $18 million of savings from this program in 2018.
significant progress was made on the global restructuring program that was announced in december 2016. this program targeted annual savings of approximately $125 million once fully implemented. the company achieved approximately $60 million of savings in 2018 bringing the total savings to approximately $110 million to date.
we expect to achieve the full-annualized target of $125 million in 2019. we will continue to aggressively manage the company's cost structure to ensure alignment with the overall demand environment, and we will make adjustments as required to remain competitive in the marketplace. restructuring savings from the 2018 and 2016 programs are expected to be between $60 million and $70 million in 2019.
raw materials are a significant input cost to the process of manufacturing coatings. ppg experiences fluctuating energy and raw material costs driven by various factors, including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories, global industry activity levels, foreign currency exchange rates, and global supply and demand factors. in aggregate, average raw material costs were higher by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2018 versus 2017 due to variety of reasons, including supplier force majeure, environmental regulation enforcement, and higher crude oil prices. ppg currently expects overall coatings raw material prices to increase a low-single-digit percentage in the first half of 2019, with impacts varied by region and commodity, marking the tenth and eleventh consecutive quarters of inflation. in addition, logistics costs were inflated throughout the year driven by higher crude oil prices and availability of transportation. logistics costs are expected to further increase in 2019.
in 2018, we achieved broad selling price improvement, reflecting the company's efforts to offset higher raw material costs. further benefits from selling price actions are necessary in 2019 to recover profit contribution margins. the company will carefully monitor raw material costs during 2019 and assess the need for additional increases to selling prices for increases in these costs.
pension and postretirement benefit costs, excluding settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits, totaled approximately $30 million in 2018, down approximately $20 million from 2017. in 2019, we expect pension and other postretirement benefit costs will be approximately $30 million, similar to 2018.
ppg contributed $75 million to its u.s. defined benefit pension plans in 2018 and $54 million in 2017. in 2018, the company made contributions aggregating $24 million to its non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans. in 2019, mandatory contributions to ppg's non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be between $20 million and $30 million.
in 2018, favorable foreign currency translation experienced in the first half of the year was mostly offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation experienced in the second half of the year. based on mid-january 2019 exchange rates, the company expects year-over-year unfavorable foreign currency translation to decrease 2019 sales by $400 million to $500 million and 2019 income before income taxes by $50 million to $70 million. we expect the foreign currency translation impact to be more prevalent during the first half of 2019 due to prior year foreign exchange rate trends. the foreign currency environment continues to be volatile, and the impact on 2019 net sales and income before income taxes could differ from this estimate. the company generally purchases raw materials, incurs manufacturing costs and sells finished goods in the same currency, so we typically incur only modest foreign currency transaction related impacts.
the 2019 effective tax rate from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 23% to 25%. this range represents the company's best estimate, including updated guidance for the 2017 the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act.
over the past five years, the company used over $5 billion of cash to repurchase approximately 50 million shares of ppg stock, including approximately $1.7 billion in 2018. the company ended the year with approximately $1.8 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization. during 2018, the company deployed approximately $380 million for acquisitions and $450 million for dividends. ppg increased its per-share dividend in october 2018, marking the 47th annual per share dividend increase and the 119th consecutive year of annual dividend payments.
ppg ended 2018 with approximately $1 billion in cash and short-term investments. the company expects continued strong cash generation in 2019.

accounting standards to be adopted in future years note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies" under item 8 of this form 10-k describes accounting pronouncements that have been promulgated prior to december 31, 2018 but are not effective until a future date.
commitments and contingent liabilities, including environmental matters ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. see item 3. "legal proceedings" and note 14, "commitments and contingent liabilities" under item 8 of this form 10-k for a description of certain of these lawsuits.
as discussed in item 3 and note 14, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg, including asbestos-related claims, will not have a material effect on ppg's consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized.
it is ppg's policy to accrue expenses for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted. in management's opinion, the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company's environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg's financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. management anticipates that the resolution of the company's environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time.
the company continues to analyze, assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with ppg's former chromium manufacturing plant in jersey city, n.j. and associated sites ("new jersey chrome"). information will continue to be generated from the ongoing groundwater remedial investigation activities related to new jersey chrome and will be incorporated into a final draft remedial action work plan for groundwater expected to be submitted to the new jersey department of environmental protection in 2021.
there are multiple, future events yet to occur, including further remedy selection and design, remedy implementation and execution and applicable governmental agency or community organization approvals. considerable uncertainty exists
38 2018 ppg annual report and 10-k regarding the timing of these future events for the new jersey chrome sites. final resolution of these events is expected to occur over the next several years. as these events occur and to the extent that the cost estimates of the environmental remediation remedies change, the existing reserve for this environmental remediation matter will be adjusted.
liquidity and capital resources during the past three years, ppg has had sufficient financial resources to meet its operating requirements, to fund our capital spending, including acquisitions, share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to shareholders.

the $64 million decrease in cash from operating activities - continuing operations was primarily due to unfavorable changes in working capital and lower income in 2018 partially offset by lower cash taxes.
the $333 million increase in cash from operating activities - continuing operations was primarily due to the absence of the prior year funding of the pittsburgh corning asbestos trust (the "trust"), lower defined benefit pension contributions, lower restructuring payments and lower interest payments, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid in 2017 and higher working capital.
operating working capital operating working capital is a subset of total working capital and represents (1) receivables from customers, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, (2) inventories, and (3) trade liabilities. see note 4, "working capital detail" under item 8 of this form 10-k for further information related to the components of the company's operating working capital. we believe operating working capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses.
a key metric we use to measure our working capital management is operating working capital as a percentage of sales (fourth quarter sales annualized).
operating working capital                                                   $2,224                $2,071

non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans        $24           $33            $54
ppg contributed $75 million to its u.s. defined benefit pension plans in 2018. contributions to ppg's non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans in 2018 were required by local funding requirements. ppg expects to make mandatory contributions to its non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans in the range of $20 million to $30 million in 2019. ppg may make voluntary contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2019 and beyond.
asbestos settlement trust funding in june 2016, ppg fully funded its portion of the trust that was established by the u.s. bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania in may 2016. ppg's total cash obligations to fund the trust totaled $813 million (pre-tax). all payments were applied against a previously established ppg reserve for the total asbestos trust obligation. the company utilized cash on hand for the payments, and this funding had no impact on ppg's previously stated cash-deployment targets. refer to note 14, "commitments and contingent liabilities" under item 8 of this form 10-k for additional information.

the company has approximately $1.8 billion remaining under the current authorization from the board of directors, which was approved in december 2017. the current authorized repurchase program has no expiration date.
ppg has paid uninterrupted annual dividends since 1899, and 2018 marked the 47th consecutive year of increased annual per-share dividend payments to shareholders. the company raised its per-share quarterly dividend by 7% to $0.48 per share paid in september 2018.
the ratio of total debt, including capital leases, to total debt and equity was 52% at december 31, 2018 up from 43% in 2017.
credit agreements and lines of credit in december 2015, ppg entered into a five-year credit agreement (the "credit agreement") with several banks and financial institutions as further discussed in note 9, "borrowings and lines of credit" under item 8 of this form 10-k. the credit agreement provides for a $1.8 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. the credit agreement will terminate on december 18, 2020. during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding.
in addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit, the company maintains access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity.
see note 9, "borrowings and lines of credit" under item 8 of this form 10-k for information regarding notes entered into and repaid as well as details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, letters of credit, guarantees and debt covenants.
contractual obligations we continue to believe that our cash on hand and short term investments, cash from operations and the company's access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital spending, acquisitions, dividend payments, debt service, share repurchases, contributions to pension plans, and ppg's significant contractual obligations. these significant contractual obligations are presented in the following table.

(3)   the unconditional purchase commitments are principally take-or-pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials, including industrial gases and electricity, consistent with customary industry practice.
other liquidity matters at december 31, 2018, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits, was $182 million. the timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities. ppg does not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year. the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur.
off-balance sheet arrangements the company's off-balance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the "liquidity and capital resources" section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in note 9, "borrowings and lines of credit" under item 8 of this form 10-k.
critical accounting estimates management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under item 8 of this form 10-k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. we believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and to accounting for pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies.
contingencies contingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss. the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to environmental remediation, to pending, impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years. for more information on these matters, see note 14, "commitments and contingent liabilities" and note 12, "income taxes" under item 8 of this form 10-k.
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works. to accomplish this, we make extensive use of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates. the company has
42 2018 ppg annual report and 10-k established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually. see note 13, "employee benefit plans" under item 8 of this form 10-k for information on these plans and the assumptions used.
business combinations in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations, the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill. the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. in addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts, the company uses a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment; third-party actuaries for the estimated obligations of defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations; and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal, environmental and other contingent liabilities.
the business and technical judgment of management was used in determining which intangible assets have indefinite lives and in determining the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets.
goodwill and intangible assets the company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment annually by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of a reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount. fair values under the quantitative test are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows. for more information on these matters, see note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies" under item 8 of this form 10-k.
we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item 8 of this form 10-k related to these contingencies, pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates.
currency comparing exchange rates from december 31, 2017 to december 31, 2018, the u.s. dollar strengthened against all other major currencies associated with countries in which ppg operates, most notably the australian dollar, british pound, chinese yuan, euro and south korean won. as a result, consolidated net assets at december 31, 2018 decreased by approximately $167 million from december 31, 2017. comparing exchange rates from december 31, 2016 to december 31, 2017, the u.s. dollar was weaker against the currencies in most countries in which ppg operates, most notably the mexican peso, british pound, chinese yuan and euro. as a result, consolidated net assets at december 31, 2017 increased by approximately $231 million from december 31, 2016.
comparing exchange rates during 2018 to those of 2017, in the countries in which ppg operates, there was a favorable impact of approximately $21 million on full year 2018 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into u.s. dollars. comparing exchange rates during 2017 to those of 2016, in the countries in which ppg operates, there was an unfavorable impact of approximately $7 million on full year 2017 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into u.s. dollars.
forward-looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. management's discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
you can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts. forward-looking statements are identified by the use of the words "aim," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "project," "outlook," "forecast" and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. you are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the securities and exchange commission. also, note the following cautionary statements.
many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's forward-looking statements. such factors include global economic conditions, increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors, fluctuations

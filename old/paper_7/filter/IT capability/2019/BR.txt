basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") in the u.s. and in accordance with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (the "sec") requirements for annual reports on form 10-k. these financial statements present the consolidated position of the company and include the entities in which the company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the company has investments recorded under the equity method of accounting as well as certain marketable and non-marketable securities. intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. amounts presented may not sum due to rounding. certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation, except as it relates to (i) asu no. 2014-09, (ii) asu no. 2016-01, "recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities ("asu no. 2016-01"), (iii) asu no. 2018-02, "reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income" ("asu no. 2018-02"), and (iv) asu no. 2016-09 "improvements to employee share-based payment accounting" ("asu no. 2016-09"), as described further below.
in presenting the consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. management continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. the estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. however, actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates made by management. in management's opinion, the consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported. the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods.
effective july 1, 2018, we adopted asu no. 2014-09 using the modified retrospective transition approach applied to all contracts. under this transition approach, we have not restated the prior period consolidated financial statements presented to the current period presentation. however, we have provided additional disclosures related to the amount by which each relevant fiscal 2019 financial statement line item was affected by the adoption of asu no. 2014-09 along with explanations for significant changes. additional information about the company's revenue recognition policies and the related impact of the adoption of asu no. 2014-09 is included in note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies" and note 3, "revenue recognition".
effective july 1, 2018, we adopted asu no. 2016-01, which requires changes in the fair value of publicly traded equity securities for which we do not have significant influence to be recorded as part of net earnings rather than as other comprehensive income (loss), net. in addition, equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value will be recorded at cost less impairment as further adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the issuer. we adopted asu no. 2016-01 using the modified-retrospective transition approach by recording the cumulative effect of previously unrecognized gains or losses on publicly traded equity securities to retained earnings as of july 1, 2018. the provisions of asu no. 2016-01 relative to equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value have been applied prospectively. the consolidated financial statements have not been revised for periods prior to july 1, 2018. the impact of adopting asu no. 2016-01 resulted in a reclassification of less than $0.1 million in unrealized gains, net from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings as of july 1, 2018.
effective july 1, 2018, we adopted asu no. 2018-02, which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects associated with the change in the u.s. federal corporate tax rate resulting from the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") enacted in december 2017. the adoption of asu no. 2018-02 resulted in an increase to retained earnings of $1.5 million.
effective july 1, 2018, we adopted asu no. 2017-07, "improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost" ("asu no. 2017-07") whereby we revised its presentation in the consolidated statements of earnings to reflect the non-service cost components of net benefit cost as part of other non-operating income (expenses), net, which were previously recorded as part of total operating expenses. all prior period information has been conformed to the current period presentation.
effective july 1, 2017, we adopted asu no. 2016-09, which identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including presenting the excess tax benefits ("etb") or deficits from the exercise or vesting of share-based payments in the income statement, classifying the etb or deficits as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows rather than as a financing activity, a revision to the criteria for classifying an award as equity or liability and an option to recognize gross stock-based compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur. in addition, asu no. 2016-09 eliminates the etb from the assumed proceeds calculation under the treasury stock method for purposes of calculating diluted shares. as a result of this adoption, we recorded etb related to stock-based compensation awards of $19.3 million and $40.9 million during the twelve months ended june 30, 2019 and 2018 in the income tax provision on a prospective basis, whereas such benefits would previously have been recognized in equity. we also excluded the etb from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended june 30, 2019 and 2018. we have not adjusted prior periods presented for the change in accounting for etb in the consolidated financial statements. we also elected to apply the change in presentation of etb in the consolidated statement of cash flows prospectively, and as a result, etb are classified as operating activities when realized through reductions to subsequent tax payments. this adoption resulted in an increase to net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding decrease to net cash provided by financing activities of $19.3 million and $40.9 million for the twelve months ended june 30, 2019 and 2018. we have not adjusted prior periods presented for the change in classification of etb on the consolidated statement of cash flows. we also elected to continue our current practice of estimating expected forfeitures as permitted by asu no. 2016-09.
critical accounting policies we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. the estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. however, actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
goodwill. we review the carrying value of all our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values. we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. when determining fair value of a reporting unit, we utilize the income approach which considers a discounted future cash flow analysis using various assumptions, including projections of revenues based on assumed long-term growth rates, estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular reporting unit's weighted-average cost of capital. the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows based on forecasted earnings before interest and taxes, and the selection of the terminal value growth rate and discount rate assumptions. the weighted-average cost of capital takes into account the relative weight of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and long-term debt). our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of our routine, long-range planning process. changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. we had $1,500.0 million of goodwill as of june 30, 2019. given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value of one of our reporting units could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our earnings.
the company performs a sensitivity analysis under step 1 of the goodwill impairment test assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units. a 10% change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows, discount rates, or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill.
income taxes. the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). the company is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the u.s. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. the company has estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $9.5 million as of june 30, 2019 of which $1.5 million are subject to expiration in the 2020 through 2028 period. the remaining $8.0 million of carryforwards has an indefinite utilization period. in addition, the company has estimated u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $18.6 million which can be utilized through 2030. u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards resulting from tax losses beginning with the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019 have an indefinite carryforward under the tax act. the company did not realize any federal net operating losses for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019.
valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings. the company has recorded valuation allowances of $3.3 million and $3.8 million at june 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income, carryforward periods, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies. projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned. the assumptions used to project future taxable income requires significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses.
on the same date that the tax act was enacted, december 22, 2017, the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no. 118 ("sab 118") which provided the company with up to one year to finalize accounting for the impacts of the tax act. under sab 118, the company finalized the prior year estimate of the net tax impact to the company arising from the enactment of the tax act, and recognized a tax benefit of approximately $0.5 million in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019.
share-based payments. accounting for stock-based compensation requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. the binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. the risk-free rate is derived from the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. the binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. determining these assumptions are subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2019 stock option grants would result in approximately a $2.1 million change in total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2019 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2019 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.8 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2019 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2019 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.1 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2019 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. a hypothetical one-half percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2019 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.9 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2019 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period.
results of operations the following discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments refer to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018. the analysis of consolidated statements of earnings should be read in conjunction with the analysis of reportable segments, which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the consolidated statements of earnings. discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017 is disclosed in part ii, "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of the 2018 annual report.
"amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property" and "acquisition and integration costs" represent certain non-cash amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets and purchased intellectual property assets, as well as certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company's acquisition activities, respectively.
"gain on sale of securities" represents a non-operating gain on the sale of securities associated with our retirement plan obligations.
"tax act items" represent a u.s. federal transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes with respect to the earnings deemed repatriated for u.s. tax purposes, and certain benefits related to the remeasurement of the company's net u.s. federal and state deferred tax liabilities attributable to the recording of the impact from the tax act, which was enacted into law on december 22, 2017.
"net new business" refers to recurring revenue from closed sales less recurring revenue from client losses.
the following definitions describe the company's revenues:
fee revenues in the investor communication solutions segment are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity. in addition, the level of recurring and event-driven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues. while event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. the types of services we provide that comprise event-driven activity are:
•   mutual fund proxy: the proxy and related services we provide to mutual funds when certain events occur requiring a shareholder vote including changes in directors, sub-advisors, fee structures, investment restrictions, and mergers of funds.
•   mutual fund communications: mutual fund communications services consist primarily of the distribution on behalf of mutual funds of supplemental information required to be provided to the annual mutual fund prospectus as a result of certain triggering events such as a change in portfolio managers. in addition, mutual fund communications consist of notices and marketing materials such as newsletters.
•   proxy contests and specials, corporate actions, and other: the proxy services we provide in connection with shareholder meetings driven by special events such as proxy contests, mergers and acquisitions, and tender/exchange offers.
event-driven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process. event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven fee revenues. as such, the timing and level of event-driven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast. during the three months ended december 31, 2018, we were initially able to separate certain annually recurring mutual fund related communications that were previously included in event-driven fee revenues. these activities were presented within recurring fee revenues commencing in the three months ended december 31, 2018. we were not able to reliably estimate the portion of event-driven fee revenues attributable to these activities in prior periods. we added approximately $12 million to recurring fee revenues for the year ended june 30, 2019, and is captured within recurring fee revenues internal growth.
generally, mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of event-driven activity. during fiscal year 2019, mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 14% lower than the prior fiscal year while during fiscal year 2018 mutual fund proxy revenues were 28% higher than the prior fiscal year. although it is difficult to forecast the levels of event-driven activity, we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future.
distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, customer communications and fulfillment services as well as matrix administrative services.
distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postage-related expenses incurred in connection with our investor communication solutions segment, as well as matrix administrative services expenses. these costs are reflected in cost of revenues.
closed sales represent an estimate of the expected annual recurring fee revenue for new client contracts that were signed by broadridge in the current reporting period. closed sales does not include event-driven or distribution activity. we consider contract terms, expected client volumes or activity, knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our clients, among other factors, when determining the estimate. management uses closed sales to measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs, as an indicator of expected future revenues and as a performance metric in determining incentive compensation.
closed sales is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or other income statement data prepared in accordance with gaap. closed sales is a useful metric for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates our ongoing operational performance.
the inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as actual achieved closed sales. larger closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months or longer to convert to revenues, particularly for the services provided by our global technology and operations segment. for fiscal years ended june 30, 2019 and 2018, we are reporting closed sales net of a 4.0% allowance adjustment. consequently, our reported closed sales amounts are not adjusted for actual revenues achieved because these adjustments are estimated in the period the sale is reported. we assess the allowance amount at the end of each fiscal year to establish the appropriate allowance for the subsequent year using trailing five years actual data as the starting point, normalized for outlying factors, if any, to enhance the accuracy of the allowance.
for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2019 and 2018, closed sales were $233.3 million and $214.9 million, respectively. the fiscal years ended june 30, 2019 and 2018, are net of an allowance adjustment of $9.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively.
the table below presents consolidated statements of earnings data for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2019 and 2018, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods:

•   the impact of the asc 606 revenue accounting change on recurring fee revenue was negligible.
•   the lower event-driven fee revenues were primarily the result of lower equity proxy contest and mutual fund proxy activity compared to fiscal year 2018.
•   distribution revenues decreased $52.1 million, or 3%, to $1,460.8 million from lower transactional print volumes and the decrease in event-driven fee revenues.
•   the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other currencies negatively impacted revenues by $25.1 million.
•   cost of revenues - the decrease of $35.4 million in cost of revenues primarily reflects: lower distribution cost of revenues driven by the decrease in distribution revenues, partially offset by higher operating costs from acquisitions and higher proxy fulfillment expenses. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased cost of revenues by $21.9 million.
•   selling, general and administrative expenses - the increase of $13.1 million in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflects: higher labor expenses, including higher performance-based compensation expense, partially offset by lower spending on growth initiatives.
operating income. operating income margins increased to 15.0% for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019, compared to 13.8% for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018, primarily due to the increase in recurring fee revenues.
interest expense, net. interest expenses, net, was $41.8 million, an increase of $3.2 million from $38.6 million in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018. the increase of $3.2 million was primarily due to an increase in interest expense primarily due to higher borrowing costs, partially offset by an increase in interest income.
other non-operating income (expenses), net. other non-operating income, net for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019 was $3.7 million, a decrease of $5.2 million, compared to $1.5 million of other non-operating expenses, net for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018. the decrease of $5.2 million was primarily due to higher expense related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, a decrease due to lower investment gains, and higher losses related to minority equity investments.
provision for income taxes.
•   effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019 - 20.6%.
•   effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 - 23.7%.
the decrease in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 is primarily due to: (i) the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate change from 35% to 21% under the tax act, which resulted in a blended u.s. federal corporate income tax rate of 28.1% for the prior year and a 21% tax rate for the current year; and, (ii) the company accrued a one-time net expense of approximately $15.4 million to reflect a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries at december 31, 2017, partially offset by a benefit related to the remeasurement of the company's net u.s. federal and state deferred tax liabilities, for which this expense did not recur in the current year, partially offset by (iii) the recognition of $19.3 million in etb attributable to stock-based compensation compared to a $40.9 million etb in the prior year.

analysis of reportable segments broadridge has two reportable business segments: (1) investor communication solutions and (2) global technology and operations.
the primary component of "other" are certain gains, losses, corporate overhead expenses and non-operating expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as interest expense. foreign currency exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign currency exchange rates and the constant foreign currency exchange rates used for internal management reporting.
certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. because the company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the company may elect to record certain segment-related operating and non-operating expense items in other rather than reflect such items in segment profit.

•   with respect to recurring fees, position growth compared to the same period in the prior year, which is a component of internal growth, was 6% for annual equity proxy communications and 9% for mutual fund and etf interims.
•   lower event-driven fee revenues were primarily the result of lower equity proxy contest and mutual fund proxy activity compared to fiscal year 2018.
•   lower distribution revenues resulted from lower transactional print volumes and the decrease in event-driven fee revenues.

explanation and reconciliation of the company's use of non-gaap financial measures the company's results in this annual report on form 10-k are presented in accordance with u.s. gaap except where otherwise noted. in certain circumstances, results have been presented that are not generally accepted accounting principles measures ("non-gaap"). these non-gaap measures are adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash flow. these non-gaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the company's reported results.
the company believes our non-gaap financial measures help investors understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the company's business performance. management believes that non-gaap measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's operating results and trends by providing an additional basis for comparison. management uses these non-gaap financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. in addition, and as a consequence of the importance of these non-gaap financial measures in managing our business, the company's compensation committee of the board of directors incorporates non-gaap financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation.
adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share these non-gaap measures reflect operating income, operating income margin, net earnings, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. these adjusted measures exclude the impact of: (i) amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property, (ii) acquisition and integration costs, (iii) tax act items and (iv) the gain on sale of securities. amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property represents non-cash amortization expenses associated with the company's acquisition activities. acquisition and integration costs represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company's acquisition activities. tax act items represent the net impact of a u.s. federal transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes and certain benefits related to the remeasurement of the company's net u.s. federal and state deferred tax liabilities attributable to the tax act. the gain on sale of securities represents a non-operating gain on the sale of securities associated with the company's retirement plan obligations.
we exclude tax act items and gain on sale of securities from our adjusted earnings measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and these items do not reflect ordinary operations or earnings. we also exclude the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property, as these non-cash amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of individual acquisitions and do not factor into the company's capital allocation decisions, management compensation metrics or multi-year objectives. furthermore, management believes that this adjustment enables better comparison of our results as amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property will not recur in future periods once such intangible assets have been fully amortized. although we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property from our adjusted earnings measures, our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that these intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.
free cash flows in addition to the non-gaap financial measures discussed above, we provide free cash flow information because we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions, other investments, as well as debt servicing. free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure and is defined by the company as net cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures as well as software purchases and capitalized internal use software.
set forth below is a reconciliation of such non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures (unaudited):

(a) calculated using the gaap effective tax rate, adjusted to exclude $19.3 million of etb associated with stock-based compensation for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019, and $40.9 million of etb associated with stock-based compensation for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018, as well as the net $15.4 million charges associated with the tax act for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018. for purposes of calculating the adjusted earnings per share, the same adjustments were made on a per share basis.

cash held by regulated entities              77.9                62.0
at june 30, 2019 and 2018, cash and cash equivalents were $273.2 million and $263.9 million, respectively. total stockholders' equity was $1,127.5 million and $1,094.3 million at june 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. at june 30, 2019, net working capital was $239.8 million compared to $213.8 million at june 30, 2018. at the current time, and in future periods, we expect cash generated by our operations, together with existing cash, cash equivalents, and borrowing capacity, to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, dividends and common stock repurchases.
at june 30, 2019, $99.8 million of the $273.2 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries, and $77.9 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by regulated entities. we expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. in addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. if these funds are needed for our operations in the u.s., we may be required to pay additional foreign taxes to repatriate these funds. however, while we may do so at a future date, the company does not need to repatriate future foreign earnings to fund u.s. operations.
outstanding borrowings and available capacity under the company's borrowing arrangements were as follows:

on march 18, 2019, the company entered into a $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility (the "fiscal 2019 revolving credit facility"), which is comprised of a $1.1 billion u.s. dollar tranche and a $400.0 million multicurrency tranche, and which replaced the $1.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility entered into during february 2017 (the "fiscal 2017 revolving credit facility"). borrowings under the fiscal 2019 revolving credit facility bear interest at libor plus 101.5 basis points. in addition, the fiscal 2019 revolving credit facility has an annual facility fee equal to 11.0 basis points on the entire facility.
at june 30, 2019, the carrying value of the company's outstanding long-term debt was $1,470.4 million, consisting of: (i) borrowings on the fiscal 2019 revolving credit facility of $575.7 million, (ii) senior notes of $399.2 million ($400.0 million principal amount less $0.1 million of unamortized bond discount and $0.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs) due september 2020 and (iii) senior notes of $495.5 million ($500.0 million principal amount less $1.5 million of unamortized bond discount and $3.0 million of unamortized debt issuance costs) due june 2026. the fiscal 2019 revolving credit facility and senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and are ranked equally in right of payment. interest on the senior notes due 2020 is payable semiannually on march 1st and september 1st of each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 3.95%. interest on the senior notes due june 2026 is payable semiannually on june 27th and december 27th of each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 3.40%.
our liquidity position may be negatively affected by changes in general economic conditions, regulatory requirements and access to the capital markets, which may be limited if we were to fail to renew any of the credit facilities on their renewal dates or if we were to fail to meet certain ratios.

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities of $76.6 million primarily reflects: (i) an increase in cash used in client implementations and related client contract payments, and (ii) an increase in cash used in working capital, partially offset by (iii) an increase in net earnings.
the increase in cash used in investing activities of $184.3 million primarily reflects (i) increased acquisitions driven primarily by the acquisition of rpm in fiscal year 2019, partially offset by (ii) lower purchases of intellectual property.
the decrease in cash used in financing activities of $276.8 million primarily reflects: (i) an increase in net proceeds from borrowings, partially offset by (ii) an increase in the repurchase of common stock, and (iii) an increase in dividends paid.
income taxes the company, headquartered in the u.s., is routinely examined by the irs and is also routinely examined by the tax authorities in the u.s. states and foreign countries in which it conducts business. the tax years under audit examination vary by tax jurisdiction. the company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations. to the extent the company determines it has potential tax assessments in particular tax jurisdictions, the company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments. once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available, when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired. the resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the financial condition of the company or on the company's consolidated statements of earnings for a particular future period.

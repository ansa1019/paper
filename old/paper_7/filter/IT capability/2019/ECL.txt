item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following management discussion and analysis ("md&a") provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. we provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and reportable segment level. we also provide quantitative information regarding special (gains) and charges, discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature. qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance.
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10-k. our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. this discussion contains various non-gaap financial measures and also contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. we refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled "non-gaap financial measures" at the end of this md&a, and "forward-looking statements" and "risk factors" within items 1 and 1a of this form 10-k. we also refer readers to the tables within the section entitled "results of operations" of this md&a for reconciliation information of non-gaap measures to u.s. gaap.
comparability of results fixed currency foreign exchange rates management evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our non-u.s. dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates, which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations. fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into u.s. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management, with all periods presented using such rates. public currency rate data provided within the "segment performance" section of this md&a reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period and is provided for informational purposes only.
comparability of reportable segments we made immaterial changes to our reportable segments, including the movement of certain customers and cost allocations between reportable segments. all comparisons and discussion throughout the md&a reflect these changes.
impact of acquisitions and divestitures acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition and exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture.
executive summary we achieved improved sales and strong earnings growth in 2019 as we drove new product introductions, new business wins and improved operating efficiency in a generally steady market environment. increased pricing was achieved to more than offset unfavorable sales mix. along with higher other income and lower interest expense, adjusted diluted earnings per share leveraged the good operating income growth and delivered the year's double-digit adjusted diluted eps growth.
sales reported sales increased 2% to $14.9 billion in 2019 from $14.7 billion in 2018. sales were positively impacted by pricing. when measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, fixed currency sales increased 4% compared to the prior year. acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increased 3% compared to the prior year.
reported diluted eps increased 9% to $5.33 in 2019 compared to $4.88 in 2018. special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years. special (gains) and charges in 2019 were driven primarily by the impact of restructuring charges, the championx separation charges, discrete tax items, acquisition and integration charges, litigation and other charges. special (gains) and charges in 2018 were driven primarily by the impact of restructuring charges and our commitment to the ecolab foundation. special (gains) and charges in 2017 were driven primarily by the impact of income tax reform, restructuring charges, other discrete taxes, acquisition and integration charges and the gain on sale of equipment care. adjusted diluted eps, which exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items increased 11% to $5.82 in 2019 compared to $5.25 in 2018.
balance sheet we remain committed to maintaining "a" range ratings metrics, supported by our current credit ratings of a-/baa1/a- by standard & poor's, moody's investor services and fitch. our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates.
net debt to ebitda our net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") was 2.0 and 2.3 for 2019 and 2018, respectively. we view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. see the "net debt to ebitda" table on page 43 for reconciliation information.
cash flow cash flow from operating activities was $2.4 billion in 2019 compared to $2.3 billion in 2018. we continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in our business, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments.
dividends we increased our quarterly cash dividend 2% in december 2019 to an indicated annual rate of $1.88 per share. the increase represents our 28th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 83rd consecutive year we have paid cash dividends. our outstanding dividend history reflects our continued growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap. our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements ("notes").
preparation of our consolidated financial statements, in conformity with u.s. gaap, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.
besides estimates that meet the "critical" estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. all estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even from estimates not deemed critical. our critical accounting estimates include the following:
revenue recognition revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing service. revenue from product and sold equipment is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer of the product or delivery of the equipment. revenue from service and leased equipment is recognized when the services are provided, or the customer receives the benefit from the leased equipment, which is over time. service revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method and aligns with when the services are provided. typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date because the effort provided by the field selling and service organization represents services provided, which corresponds with the transfer of control. revenue for leased equipment is accounted for under topic 842 leases and recognized on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease contract.
our revenue policies do not provide for general rights of return. we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives based primarily on historical experience and anticipated performance over the contract period. depending on market conditions, we may increase customer incentive offerings, which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive. we also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits based on specific circumstances and credit conditions, and when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectible. for additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts, see discussion below.
the revenue standard can be applied to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics if it is reasonable that the effects of applying the standard at the portfolio would not be significantly different than applying the standard at the individual contract level. we apply the portfolio approach primarily within each operating segment by geographical region. application of the portfolio approach was focused on those characteristics that have the most significant accounting consequences in terms of their effect on the timing of revenue recognition or the amount of revenue recognized. we determined the key criteria to assess with respect to the portfolio approach, including the related deliverables, the characteristics of the customers and the timing and transfer of goods and services, which most closely aligned within the operating segments. in addition, the accountability for the business operations, as well as the operational decisions on how to go to market and the product offerings, are performed at the operating segment level. for additional information on revenue recognition, see note 17.
valuation allowances and accrued liabilities allowances for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age and applying historical write-off and collection trend rates. in addition, our estimates also include separately providing for customer receivables based on specific circumstances and credit conditions, and when it is deemed probable the balance is uncollectible. we estimate our sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits and apply these trend rates to calculate estimated reserves for future credits. actual results could differ from these estimates.
our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $62 million and $61 million, as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. these amounts include our allowance for sales returns and credits of $18 million and $17 million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. our bad debt expense as a percent of reported net sales was 0.1% in each of the years 2019, 2018 and 2017. we believe it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience. however, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, or if unexpected events, economic downturns, or significant changes in future trends were to occur, additional allowances may be required. for additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts, see note 2.
accrued liabilities our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations.
we record liabilities related to pending litigation, environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs. we record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses. expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain. while the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals, and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position. for additional information on our commitments and contingencies, see note 15.
actuarially determined liabilities pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans the measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries. these assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses.
the significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate, expected return on assets, projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table.
●   the discount rate assumptions for our u.s. plans are assessed using a yield curve constructed from a subset of bonds yielding greater than the median return from a population of non-callable, corporate bond issues that have an average rating of aa when averaging available moody's investor services, standard &amp; poor's and fitch ratings. the discount rate is calculated by matching the plans' projected cash flows to the bond yield curve. for 2019 and 2018, we elected to measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows. we believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans' liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. in determining our u.s. pension obligations for 2019, our weighted-average discount rate decreased to 3.20% from 4.34% at year-end 2018. in determining our u.s. postretirement health care obligation for 2019, our weighted-average discount rate decreased to 3.16% from 4.29% at year-end 2018.
●   for postretirement benefit measurement purposes as of december 31, 2019, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed to be 8.00% for pre-65 costs and 10.75% for post-65 costs. the rates are assumed to decrease each year until they reach 5% in 2028 and remain at those levels thereafter.
●   in determining our u.s. pension and u.s. postretirement health care obligation for 2019, we utilized the most recent mortality table, mp-2019 projection scale (applied to the pri-2012 mortality table).
the effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of december 31, 2019, on the december 31, 2019 defined benefit obligation and 2020 expense is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant u.s. plans. expense amounts reflect the accounting for actuarial gains as a component of other comprehensive income and recognition of the impacts into income over the remaining service period:
effect on u.s. postretirement health care benefits plans increase in              higher assumption         recorded                 2020
our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans, with the majority of the amounts held in the u.k. and eurozone countries. we use assumptions similar to our u.s. plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations, however, the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information.
see note 16 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies, estimates, funded status, contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations.
self-insurance globally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses. we are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles, subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles. we are self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. we determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis.
restructuring our restructuring activities are associated with plans to enhance our efficiency, effectiveness and sharpen the competitiveness of our businesses. these restructuring plans include net costs associated with significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs and asset write-downs and disposals. employee termination costs are largely based on policies and severance plans, and include personnel reductions and related costs for severance, benefits and outplacement services. these charges are reflected in the quarter in which the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. contract termination costs include charges to terminate leases prior to the end of their respective terms and other contract termination costs. asset write-downs and disposals include leasehold improvement write-downs, other asset write-downs associated with combining operations and disposal of assets.
restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales and special (gains) and charges on the consolidated statement of income. amounts included as a component of cost of sales include supply chain related severance and other asset write-downs associated with combining operations. restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of both other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. our restructuring liability balance was $112 million and $79 million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. for additional information on our restructuring activities, see note 3.
income taxes judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions.
on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") was enacted, which reduces the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. the tax act added many new provisions including changes to bonus depreciation, the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense, a tax on global intangible low taxed income (gilti), the base erosion anti abuse tax (beat) and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (fdii).
we recorded an estimate of the one-time transition tax in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $160 million and in 2018 and 2019 we recorded additional discrete expense of $66 million and benefit of $3.1 million, respectively, primarily due to the issuance of technical guidance in both years, the finalization of certain estimates as a result of filing the 2017 and 2018 u.s. federal tax return and the finalization of the balance sheet positions used in the calculation of the transition tax. we have completed our accounting for the effects of the tax act as they relate to the repricing of deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax.
additionally, proposed regulations were released during 2019. certain of the proposed regulations may be subject to challenge; therefore, we recorded tax expense based on our interpretation of the changes in law affected by the tax act and not the proposed regulations. if the proposed regulations become final, we will record the impact at that time.
effective income tax rate our effective income tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions. we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. this expected annual rate is then applied to our year-to-date operating results. in the event there is a significant discrete item recognized in our interim operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the same period.
tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. as a result, the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns. some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense.
deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the utilization of the entire deduction or credit. relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results, future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes. deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized that tax benefit in our financial statements.
during 2019, due to the adoption of the new lease standard and the recording of operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, we recorded related deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets, respectively.
uncertain tax positions a number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. the number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. the internal revenue service ("irs") has completed its examinations of our u.s. federal income tax returns through 2016 and the years 2017 and 2018 are currently under audit. in addition to the u.s. federal examinations, we have ongoing audit activity in several u.s. state and foreign jurisdictions.
the tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal, state and international jurisdictions. we believe our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations, and our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken. because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations, we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits (including related interest and penalties) for amounts that do not meet the more-likely-than-not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance. the tax reserves are reviewed throughout the year, taking into account new legislation, regulations, case law and audit results. settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts, cash payments or receipts and/or adjustments to tax expense. tax reserves are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within other non-current liabilities. our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $28 million and $50 million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. for additional information on income taxes see note 12.
long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill long-lived and amortizable intangible assets we review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $7.0 billion and $7.1 billion as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for impairment and when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value.
we use the straight-line method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets, including our customer relationships. we consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships, including projected sales data, customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships.
globally, we have a broad customer base. our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions, including the customer bases acquired from our nalco and champion transactions, which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships. our historical retention rate, coupled with our consistent track record of keeping long-term relationships with our customers, supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer base. if our customer retention rate or other post-acquisition operational activities changed materially, we would evaluate the financial impact and any corresponding triggers which could result in an acceleration of amortization or impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets.
in addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. we have experienced no significant changes in the carrying value or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets.
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets we had total goodwill of $7.3 billion and $7.1 billion as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter. our reporting units are aligned with our eleven operating segments.
for our 2019 impairment assessment, we completed our assessment for goodwill impairment across our reporting units using a two-step quantitative analysis, utilizing a discounted cash flow approach. the first step of the analysis involved determining the estimated fair value of each reporting unit and comparing them to the respective carrying values, including goodwill. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired, and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any. our goodwill impairment assessment for 2019 indicated the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the unit's carrying amount by a significant margin. we assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit may not be recoverable. there has been no impairment of goodwill in any of the years presented.
as part of the nalco merger, we added the "nalco" trade name as an indefinite life intangible asset, the total value of which was $1.2 billion as of december 31, 2019 and 2018. the carrying value of the indefinite life trade name was subject to annual impairment testing, using a relief from royalty assessment method, during the second quarter of 2019. our nalco trade name assessment for 2019 indicated the estimated fair value of the asset exceeded its carrying amount by a significant margin. we assess the need to test the nalco trade name for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. there has been no impairment of the nalco trade name in any of the years presented.

cost of sales ("cos") and gross profit margin ("gross margin")
our reported gross margin was 41.5%, 41.2%, and 41.7% for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. our 2019, 2018 and 2017 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special (gains) and charges of $38.5 million, $9.3 million, and $44.0 million, respectively. special (gains) and charges items impacting cos are shown within the "special (gains) and charges" table on page 33.
special (gains) and charges special (gains) and charges reported on the consolidated statement of income included the following items:
cost of sales restructuring activities                               $20.4                $12.1                   $4.6

for segment reporting purposes, special (gains) and charges are not allocated to reportable segments, which is consistent with our internal management reporting.
restructuring activities restructuring activities are primarily related to accelerate 2020 (described below). these activities have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges, and other (income) expense on the consolidated statement of income. restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
during the third quarter of 2018, we formally commenced a restructuring plan accelerate 2020 ("the plan"), to leverage technology and system investments and organizational changes. in 2019, we raised our goals for the plan to further simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity and management layers, consolidated facilitates and focus on key long-term growth areas by further leveraging technology and structural improvements. we expect that the restructuring activities will be completed by the end of 2020, with total anticipated costs of $260 million ($200 million after tax), or an estimated $0.68 per diluted share, over this period of time. costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance costs and some facility closure costs relating to team reorganizations. actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken.
we recorded restructuring charges of $136.6 million ($104.4 million after tax) or $0.36 per diluted share in 2019. of these expenses, $2.0 million ($1.5 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share is recorded in other (income) expense. the liability related to the plan was $104.0 million as of the end of the year. we have recorded $241.2 million ($184.0 million after tax), or $0.63 per diluted share, of cumulative restructuring charges under the plan. the majority of the pretax charges represent net cash expenditures which are expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters which continue to be funded from operating activities.
the plan has delivered $125 million of cumulative cost savings with estimated annual cost savings of $325 million by 2021.
other restructuring activities during 2019, we incurred restructuring charges of $4.1 million ($3.3 million after tax), or $0.01 per diluted share, related to an immaterial restructuring plan. the charges are comprised of severance, facility closure costs, including asset disposals, and consulting fees.
the restructuring liability balance for all plans excluding accelerate 2020 was $7.7 million and $14.9 million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the reduction in liability was driven primarily by severance payments. the remaining liability is expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and will continue to be funded from operating activities. cash payments during 2019 related to these plans were $8.3 million.
championx separation on december 18, 2019, we entered into definitive agreements with championx and apergy pursuant to which we will separate the upstream energy business of our global energy segment and combine it with apergy in a tax-efficient reverse morris trust transaction. during 2019, the charges associated with the separation reported in special (gains) and charges on the consolidated statement of income include $77.3 million ($65.8 million after tax) or $0.22 per diluted share. the charges are primarily related to professional fees to support the separation. championx separation costs reported in other (income) expense on the consolidated statement of income in 2019 include $7.5 million ($5.7 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share related to pension curtailments and settlements due to the separation.
acquisition and integration related costs acquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the consolidated statement of income in 2019 include $5.6 million ($4.1 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share. charges are primarily related to bioquell plc ("bioquell") and laboratoires anios ("anios") acquisitions and consist of integration costs, advisory and legal fees. acquisition and integration costs reported in product and equipment cost of sales on the consolidated statement of income in 2019 include $7.6 million ($5.6 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share and are related to recognition of fair value step-up in the bioquell inventory and facility closure costs. in conjunction with our acquisitions, we incurred $0.2 million ($0.1 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of interest expense in 2019.
during 2018, acquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the consolidated statement of income included $8.8 million ($6.1 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share, of charges primarily related to anios integration costs, advisory and legal fees. the acquisition and integration gains reported in cost of sales on the consolidated statement of income in 2018 related to changes in estimates related to an early lease exist. in conjunction with our acquisitions, we incurred $0.3 million ($0.2 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, of interest expense in 2018.
during 2017, acquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the consolidated statement of income included $15.4 million ($9.9 million after tax), or $0.03 per diluted share, of acquisition costs, advisory and legal fees, and integration charges for the anios and swisher acquisitions. acquisition and integration costs reported in cost of sales on the consolidated statement of income in 2017 included $13.2 million ($8.6 million after tax), or $0.03 per diluted share, which related primarily to disposal of excess inventory upon the closure of swisher plants, accelerated rent expense, and amounts related to recognition of fair value step-up in the anios inventory. further information related to our acquisitions is included in note 4.
gain on sale of business during 2017, we disposed of the equipment care business and recorded a gain of $46.1 million ($12.4 million after tax primarily due to non-deductible goodwill), or $0.04 per diluted share, net of working capital adjustments, costs to sell and other transaction expenses. the gain was included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the consolidated statement of income.

our reported tax rate was 17.0%, 20.2%, and 13.8% for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the change in our tax rate includes the tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items, which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates, as amounts included in our special (gains) and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our tax rate, and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods. the tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future. the enactment of the tax act also significantly impacted the comparability of our reported tax rate.
we recognized total net benefit related to discrete tax items of $58.4 million during 2019. share-based compensation excess tax benefit contributed $43.1 million in 2019. the extent of excess tax benefits is subject to variation in stock price and stock option exercises. we recognized $15.6 million tax benefit related to changes in local tax law, which primarily includes $30.4 million benefit due to the passage of the swiss tax reform and ahv financing act, a swiss federal tax law, offset by a tax expense of $10.2 million due to the release of the final treasury regulation governing taxation of foreign dividends. we recorded changes in reserves in non-u.s. and u.s. jurisdictions due to audit settlements and statutes of limitations which resulted in a $16.8 million tax benefit. we finalized the 2015 and 2016 irs audit, which also resulted in discrete tax expense of $11.0 million. the remaining discrete tax expense was primarily related to changes in estimates in non-u.s. jurisdictions.
we recognized total net expense related to discrete tax items of $4.7 million during 2018. in the third quarter of 2018, we filed u.s. federal tax returns which resulted in favorable adjustments of $39.9 million related to changes in estimates and an irs approved method change. u.s. tax reform (as described further below) resulted in $66.0 million expense for 2018. share-based compensation excess tax benefit contributed $28.1 million in 2018. the extent of excess tax benefits is subject to variation in stock price and stock option exercises. included within the 2018 provision for income taxes in $44.2 million of discrete charges recorded in the fourth quarter to correct immaterial errors in prior years. the remaining discrete tax expense was primarily related to changes in reserves in non-u.s. jurisdictions, audit settlements and both international and u.s. changes in estimates.
on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") was enacted, which reduced the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. the tax act added many new provisions including changes to bonus depreciation, the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense, a tax on global intangible low taxed income (gilti), the base erosion anti abuse tax (beat) and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (fdii). in january 2018, accounting guidance was issued requiring a company to make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on future u.s. inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a current-period expense when incurred (the "period cost method") or factor such amounts into a company's measurement of our deferred taxes (the "deferred method"). we have elected the period cost method and included the gilti impact in our tax expense.
we initially recorded an estimate of the one-time transition tax in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $160.1 million and in 2018 we recorded additional discrete expense of $66.0 million associated with finalizing our accounting for the tax act, primarily due to the issuance of technical guidance during the year and finalization of estimates related to asset balances and calculation of foreign earnings and profits. our 2017 reported rate also includes a $319.0 million tax benefit for recording deferred tax assets and liabilities at the u.s. enacted tax rate of 21%. our 2017 reported tax rate also includes the tax impact of special (gains) and charges, as well as additional tax benefits utilized in anticipation of u.s. tax reform of $7.8 million. during 2017, we also recorded a discrete tax benefit of $39.7 million related to excess tax benefits. in addition, we recorded net discrete expenses of $14.4 million related to recognizing adjustments from filing our 2016 u.s. federal income tax return and international adjustments due to changes in estimates, partially offset by the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in state tax matters.
the adjusted rate was 20.3% for both 2019 and 2018. the change in our adjusted tax rate from 2018 to 2017 was primarily driven by enactment of the tax act, global tax planning projects and geographic income mix. future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors, including but not limited to, the tax act, other changes in global tax rules, further tax planning projects and geographic income mix.

we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in the business and pension obligations along with returning cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases.
comparability of cash generated from operating activities across 2019 to 2017 was impacted by fluctuations in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable ("working capital"), the combination of which increased $74 million, $192 million and $56 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively. the cash flow impact across the three years from working capital accounts was driven by changes in sales volumes and timing of collections; timing of purchases and production and usage levels; and volume of purchases and timing of payments.

our cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the issuances and repayment of debt, common stock repurchases, proceeds from common stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs, dividend payments and acquisition-related contingent considerations.
shares are repurchased for the purpose of partially offsetting the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans and stock issued in acquisitions, to manage our capital structure and to efficiently return capital to shareholders. we repurchased a total of $354 million, $562 million, and $600 million of shares in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 2017 amount includes $300 million of shares repurchased through an accelerated stock repurchase ("asr") agreement. see note 10 for further information regarding the asr agreement.
liquidity and capital resources we currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for the next twelve months, including scheduled debt repayments, new investments in the business, share repurchases, dividend payments, possible business acquisitions and pension and postretirement contributions with cash from operating activities, and as needed, additional short-term and/or long-term borrowings. we continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong.
as of december 31, 2019, we had a $2.0 billion multi-year credit facility, which expires in november 2022. the credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks and supports our u.s. and euro commercial paper programs. the maximum aggregate amount of commercial paper that may be issued under our u.s. commercial paper program and our euro commercial paper program may not exceed $2.0 billion. at year-end, we had $55.1 million (€50.0 million) of commercial paper outstanding under the euro commercial paper program and no borrowings under the u.s. commercial paper program. there were no borrowings under our credit facility as of december 31, 2019 or 2018. as of december 31, 2019, both programs were rated a-2 by standard & poor's, p-2 by moody's and f-1 by fitch.
additionally, we have uncommitted credit lines with major international banks and financial institutions. these credit lines support our daily global funding needs, primarily our global cash pooling structures. we have $165 million of bank supported letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees outstanding in support of our commercial business transactions. we do not have any other significant unconditional purchase obligations or commercial commitments.
as of december 31, 2019, standard & poor's and fitch both rated our long-term credit at a- (stable outlook) and moody's rated our long-term credit at baa1 (positive outlook). a reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or negotiate new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities.
we are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures.

as of december 31, 2019, our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $28 million. we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required. therefore, these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.
we do not have required minimum cash contribution obligations for our qualified pension plans in 2020. we are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements. we estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate $46 million in 2020. these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.
we lease certain sales and administrative office facilities, distribution centers, research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longer-term operating leases. vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration. vehicle leases have residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. operating leases were not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in 2018 or 2017. through the normal course of business, we have established various joint ventures, some of which have not been consolidated within our financial statements as we neither control, nor are the primary beneficiary. the joint ventures help us meet local ownership requirements, achieve quicker operational scale, expand our ability to provide customers a more fully integrated offering or provide other benefits to our business or customers. these entities have not been utilized as special purposes entities, which are sometimes established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. as such, we are not exposed to financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.
market risk we enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing monitoring and reporting, and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows.
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements, and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than u.s. dollars. we use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. as of december 31, 2019, we had a total of €1,150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges.
see note 8 for further information on our hedging activity.
based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10% change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increase/decrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately $257 million. the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.
global economic and political environment energy markets approximately 22% of our sales are generated from our global energy segment, the results of which are subject to volatility in the oil and gas commodity markets. during 2019, the north american oil industry drilling and production activity slowed from 2018 levels, while international activity showed modest improvement. demand for oil and overall energy consumption has shown modest growth with oil prices well above their lows in early 2016.
our global footprint and broad business portfolio within the global energy segment, as well as our strong execution capabilities are expected to provide the required resilience to perform well in the current market. as such, we continue to remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of the segment.
global economies almost half of our sales are outside of the united states. our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results.
argentina has continued to experience negative economic trends, evidenced by multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the argentine peso, and increasing borrowing rates. argentina is classified as a highly inflationary economy in accordance with u.s. gaap, and the u.s. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in argentina. during 2019, sales in argentina represented less than 1% of our consolidated sales. assets held in argentina at the end of 2019 represented less than 1% of our consolidated assets.
the coronavirus has had a negative impact on market conditions and customer demand, starting in china. we anticipate an impact to our 2020 sales from lower market demand, but we are not yet able to estimate the full impact of the coronavirus outbreak as it continues to spread beyond china.
brexit referendum effective on january 31, 2020, the u.k. has formally left the european union. the u.k.'s relationship with the eu will no longer be governed by the eu treaties, but instead by the terms of the withdrawal agreement agreed between the u.k. and the eu in late 2019. the withdrawal agreement provides for a "transition" period, which commenced the moment the u.k. leaves the eu and is currently set to end on december 31, 2020. at the end of the transition period, there may be significant changes to the u.k.'s business environment. while the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the u.k. makes to retain access to eu markets or the failure to reach such agreements, the uncertainties created by brexit, any resolution between the u.k. and eu countries or the failure to reach any such resolutions, could adversely affect our relationships with customers, suppliers and employees and could adversely affect our business.
subsequent events subsequent to year-end, we reached an agreement to purchase cid lines, a leading global provider of livestock biosecurity and hygiene solutions. the acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020 subject to various regulatory clearances.
non-gaap financial measures this md&a includes financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap. these non-gaap measures include:
●  acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales
●  acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income
●  acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin
●  ebitda
●  adjusted diluted eps we provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. we use these non-gaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.
our non-gaap financial measures for cost of sales, gross margin, interest expense and operating income exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, and our non-gaap measures for tax rate, net income attributable to ecolab and diluted eps further exclude the impact of discrete tax items. we include items within special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items that we believe can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results. after tax special (gains) and charges are derived by applying the applicable local jurisdictional tax rate to the corresponding pre-tax special (gains) and charges.
ebitda is defined as the sum of net income including non-controlling interest, provision for income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization. ebitda is used in our net debt to ebitda ratio, which we view as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization.
acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture.
these non-gaap measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to u.s. gaap, and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. we recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the u.s. gaap measures included in this md&a and we have provided reconciliations of reported u.s. gaap amounts to the non-gaap amounts.

2019 operations summary net income attributable to hca healthcare, inc. totaled $3.505 billion, or $10.07 per diluted share, for 2019, compared to $3.787 billion, or $10.66 per diluted share, for 2018. the 2019 results include gains on sales of facilities of $18 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, and losses on retirement of debt of $211 million, or $0.47 per diluted share. the 2018 results include gains on sales of facilities of $428 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, and losses on retirement of debt of $9 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. the 2019 results also include revenues of $86 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, related to the resolution of transaction price differences regarding certain out-of-network services performed in prior periods. the 2018 results also include a reduction in our provision for income taxes of $67 million, or $0.19 per share, for the remeasurement of certain of our deferred tax assets and liabilities for which we were unable to record reasonable estimates in 2017. during 2019 and 2018, we recorded reductions to the provision for professional liability risks of $50 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, and $70 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, respectively. during 2018, we recorded additional expenses and losses of revenues estimated at approximately $31 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, associated with the impact of hurricane michael on our florida facilities. this amount is prior to any insurance recoveries. during 2018, we recorded a benefit of $49 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, from an insurance recovery related to hurricane harvey business interruption losses incurred during 2017, and we recorded a reduction to the provision for income taxes of $28 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for tax credits related to certain 2017 hurricane-related expenses. our provisions for income taxes for 2019 and 2018 included tax benefits of $65 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, and $124 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, respectively, related to employee equity award settlements. all "per diluted share" disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. shares used for diluted earnings per share were 348.226 million shares and 355.303 million shares for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. during 2019 and 2018, we repurchased 7.949 million and 14.070 million shares, respectively, of our common stock.
revenues increased to $51.336 billion for 2019 from $46.677 billion for 2018. revenues increased 10.0% and 5.9%, respectively, on a consolidated basis and on a same facility basis for 2019, compared to 2018. the consolidated revenues increase can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 3.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 6.6% increase in equivalent admissions. the same facility revenues increase resulted primarily from a 2.3% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 3.5% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.
during 2019, consolidated admissions increased 5.2% and same facility admissions increased 2.8%, compared to 2018. inpatient surgical volumes increased 3.4% on a consolidated basis and increased 1.1% on a same facility basis during 2019, compared to 2018. outpatient surgical volumes increased 4.0% on a
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
consolidated basis and increased 1.6% on a same facility basis during 2019, compared to 2018. emergency room visits increased 4.5% on a consolidated basis and increased 2.8% on a same facility basis during 2019, compared to 2018.
the estimated cost of total uncompensated care increased $415 million for 2019, compared to 2018. consolidated and same facility uninsured admissions increased 5.8% and 3.7%, respectively, and consolidated and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 5.8% and 3.9%, respectively, for 2019, compared to 2018.
cash flows from operating activities increased $841 million, from $6.761 billion for 2018 to $7.602 billion for 2019. the increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily related to the increase in net income, excluding gains on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, of $222 million and increases related to income taxes of $322 million and depreciation and amortization of $318 million.
business strategy we are committed to providing the communities we serve with high quality, cost-effective health care while growing our business and creating long-term value for our stockholders. to achieve these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda:
grow our presence in existing markets. we believe we are well positioned in a number of large and growing markets that will allow us the opportunity to generate long-term, attractive growth through the expansion of our presence in these markets. we plan to continue recruiting and strategically collaborating with the physician community and developing comprehensive service lines such as cardiology, neurology, oncology, orthopedics and women's services. additional components of our growth strategy include providing access and convenience through developing various outpatient facilities, including, but not limited to surgery centers, urgent care clinics, freestanding emergency care facilities and imaging centers.
achieve industry-leading performance in clinical and satisfaction measures. achieving high levels of patient safety, patient satisfaction and clinical quality are central goals of our business. to achieve these goals, we have implemented a number of initiatives including infection reduction initiatives, hospitalist programs, advanced health information technology and evidence-based medicine programs. we routinely analyze operational practices from our best-performing hospitals to identify ways to implement organization-wide performance improvements and reduce clinical variation. we believe these initiatives will continue to improve patient care, help us achieve cost efficiencies and favorably position us in an environment where our constituents are increasingly focused on quality, efficacy and efficiency.
recruit and employ physicians to meet the needs for high quality health services. we depend on the quality and dedication of the health care providers and other team members who serve at our facilities. we believe a critical component of our growth strategy is our ability to successfully recruit and strategically collaborate with physicians and other professionals to provide high quality care. we attract and retain physicians by providing high quality, convenient facilities with advanced technology, by expanding our specialty services and by building our outpatient operations. we believe our continued investment in the employment, recruitment and retention of physicians will improve the quality of care at our facilities.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
continue to leverage our scale and market positions to grow the company. we believe there is significant opportunity to continue to grow our company by fully leveraging the scale and scope of our organization. we continue to invest in initiatives such as care navigators, clinical data exchange and centralized patient transfer operations, which will enable us to improve coordination of care and patient retention across our markets. we believe our centrally managed business processes and ability to leverage cost-saving practices across our extensive network will enable us to continue to manage costs effectively. we continue to invest in our parallon subsidiary group to leverage key components of our support infrastructure, including revenue cycle management, health care group purchasing, supply chain management and staffing functions.
pursue a disciplined development strategy. we continue to believe there are significant growth opportunities in our markets. we will continue to provide financial and operational resources to analyze and develop our in-market opportunities. to complement our in-market growth agenda, we intend to focus on selectively developing and acquiring new hospitals, outpatient facilities and other health care service providers. we believe the challenges faced by the hospital industry may continue to spur consolidation and we believe our size, scale, national presence and access to capital will position us well to participate in any such consolidation.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known. actual results may differ from these estimates.
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenues revenues are recorded during the period the health care services are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from payers. estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. the estimated reimbursement amounts are made on a payer-specific basis and are recorded based on the best information available regarding management's interpretation of the applicable laws, regulations and contract terms. management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals. we have invested significant resources to refine and improve our billing systems and the information system data used to make contractual allowance estimates. we have developed standardized calculation processes and related employee training programs to improve the utility of our patient accounting systems.
the emergency medical treatment and labor act ("emtala") requires any hospital participating in the medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital's emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition,
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
critical accounting policies and estimates (continued)
to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. the obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual's ability to pay for treatment. federal and state laws and regulations, including but not limited to emtala, require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care encourages, the provision of services to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive.
prior to november 2017, patients treated at hospitals for non-elective care, who have income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, were eligible for charity care. during november 2017, we expanded our charity policy to include patients who have income above 200%, but at or below 400%, of the federal poverty level and we limit the patient responsibility amounts for these patients to a percentage of their annual household income, computed on a sliding scale based upon their annual income and the applicable percentage of the federal poverty level. the federal poverty level is established by the federal government and is based on income and family size. because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in revenues. we provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care. we may attempt to provide assistance to uninsured patients to help determine whether they may qualify for medicaid, other federal or state assistance, or charity care. if an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.
due to the complexities involved in the classification and documentation of health care services authorized and provided, the estimation of revenues earned and the related reimbursement are often subject to interpretations that could result in payments that are different from our estimates. adjustments to estimated medicare and medicaid reimbursement amounts and disproportionate-share funds, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during the respective year were $51 million, $29 million and $41 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during previous years were $13 million, $51 million and $56 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. we expect adjustments during the next 12 months related to medicare and medicaid cost report filings and settlements will result in increases to revenues generally similar to the amounts recorded during these years.
the collection of outstanding receivables for medicare, medicaid, managed care payers, other third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. the primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. implicit price concessions relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. estimated implicit price concessions are recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the age of those accounts. accounts are written off when all reasonable collection efforts have been performed.
the estimates for implicit price concessions are based upon management's assessment of historical writeoffs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and collections at facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and accounts receivable (the "hindsight analysis") as a primary source of information in estimating the collectability of our accounts receivable. we perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. we believe our quarterly updates to the estimated implicit price
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
critical accounting policies and estimates (continued)
concession amounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable estimates of our revenues and valuations of our accounts receivable. these routine, quarterly changes in estimates have not resulted in material adjustments to the valuations of our accounts receivable or period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations. at december 31, 2019 and december 31, 2018, estimated implicit price concessions of $6.953 billion and $6.280 billion, respectively, had been recorded to adjust our revenues and accounts receivable to the estimated amounts we expect to collect.
to quantify the total impact of and trends related to uninsured patient accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view total uncompensated care, which is comprised of charity care, uninsured discounts and implicit price concessions. a summary of the estimated cost of total uncompensated care for the years ended december 31, follows (dollars in millions):
patient care costs (salaries and benefits, supplies, other operating expenses and depreciation and amortization)         $44,118             $40,035             $37,557
days revenues in accounts receivable were 50 days, 51 days and 52 days at december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. management expects a continuation of the challenges related to the collection of the patient due accounts. adverse changes in the percentage of our patients having adequate health care coverage, increases in patient responsibility amounts under certain health care coverages, general economic conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer mix, or trends in federal, state, and private employer health care coverage could affect the collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations.
professional liability claims we, along with virtually all health care providers, operate in an environment with professional liability risks. our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence, subject, in most cases, to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. the insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of $25 million per occurrence. we purchase excess insurance on a claims-made basis for losses in excess of $50 million per occurrence. provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $497 million, $447 million and $466 million for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. during 2019 and 2018, we recorded reductions to the provision for professional liability risks of $50 million and $70 million, respectively, due to the receipt of updated actuarial information.
reserves for professional liability risks represent the estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. the estimated ultimate cost includes
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
critical accounting policies and estimates (continued)
professional liability claims (continued)
estimates of direct expenses and fees paid to outside counsel and experts, but does not include the general overhead costs of our insurance subsidiary or corporate office. individual case reserves are established based upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimates of the future costs that will be paid on reported claims. case reserves are reduced as claim payments are made and are adjusted upward or downward as our estimates regarding the amounts of future losses are revised. once the case reserves for known claims are determined, information is stratified by loss layers and retentions, accident years, reported years, and geographic location of our hospitals. several actuarial methods are employed to utilize this data to produce estimates of ultimate losses and reserves for incurred but not reported claims, including: paid and incurred extrapolation methods utilizing paid and incurred loss development to estimate ultimate losses; frequency and severity methods utilizing paid and incurred claims development to estimate ultimate average frequency (number of claims) and ultimate average severity (cost per claim); and bornhuetter-ferguson methods which add expected development to actual paid or incurred experience to estimate ultimate losses. these methods use our company-specific historical claims data and other information. company-specific claim reporting and payment data collected over an approximate 20-year period is used in our reserve estimation process. this company-specific data includes information regarding our business, including historical paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, historical and current case loss reserves, actual and projected hospital statistical data, professional liability retentions for each policy year, geographic information and other data.
reserves and provisions for professional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. the estimated reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under reinsurance contracts, were $1.589 billion to $1.903 billion at december 31, 2019 and $1.514 billion to $1.814 billion at december 31, 2018. our estimated reserves for professional liability claims may change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends. we perform sensitivity analyses which model the volatility of key actuarial assumptions and monitor our reserves for adequacy relative to all our assumptions in the aggregate. based on our analysis, we believe the estimated professional liability reserve ranges represent the reasonably likely outcomes for ultimate losses. we consider the number and severity of claims to be the most significant assumptions in estimating reserves for professional liabilities. a 2.5% change in the expected frequency trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $32 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $31 million. a 2.5% change in the expected claim severity trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $117 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $107 million. we believe adequate reserves have been recorded for our professional liability claims; however, due to the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to resolve the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes, our ultimate liability for professional liability claims could change by more than the estimated sensitivity amounts and could change materially from our current estimates.
the reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately 2,300 and 2,200 individual claims at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and estimates for unreported potential claims. the time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated. the average time period between the occurrence and final resolution for our professional liability claims is approximately four years, although the facts and circumstances of each individual claim can result in an occurrence-to-resolution timeframe that varies from this average. the estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly.
reserves for professional liability risks were $1.827 billion and $1.741 billion at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the current portion of these reserves, $457 million and $466 million at december 31, 2019

and 2018, respectively, is included in "other accrued expenses." obligations covered by reinsurance and excess insurance contracts are included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not meet their obligations. reserves for professional liability risks (net of $46 million and $50 million receivable under reinsurance and excess insurance contracts at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively) were $1.781 billion and $1.692 billion at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the estimated total net reserves for professional liability risks at december 31, 2019 and 2018 are comprised of $695 million and $703 million, respectively, of case reserves for known claims and $1.086 billion and $989 million, respectively, of reserves for incurred but not reported claims.
changes in our professional liability reserves, net of reinsurance recoverable, for the years ended december 31, are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):
net reserves for professional liability claims, january 1            $1,692              $1,603              $1,494
net reserves for professional liability claims, december 31          $1,781              $1,692              $1,603
income taxes we calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences that arise from the recognition of items in different periods for tax and accounting purposes. deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effects of amounts expensed in our income statement for which tax deductions will be claimed in future periods. interest and penalties payable to taxing authorities are included as a component of our provision for income taxes. we have elected to treat taxes incurred on global intangible low-taxed income as a period expense.
although we believe we have properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws, federal, state or foreign taxing authorities may challenge our tax positions upon audit. significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of uncertain tax positions. we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our income tax returns. during each reporting period, we assess the facts and circumstances related to uncertain tax positions. if the realization of unrecognized tax benefits is deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances, the estimated liability and the provision for income taxes are reduced in the current period. final audit results may vary from our estimates.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
results of operations revenue/volume trends our revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charge and negotiated payment rates for such services. gross charges typically do not reflect what our facilities are actually paid. our facilities have entered into agreements with third-party payers, including government programs and managed care health plans, under which the facilities are paid based upon the cost of providing services, predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or discounts from gross charges. we do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues. we provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care.
same facility revenues increased 5.9% for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the year ended december 31, 2018 and increased 6.5% for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. the 5.9% increase for 2019 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 2.3% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 3.5% increase in same facility equivalent admissions. the 6.5% increase for 2018 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 3.9% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 2.5% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.
consolidated admissions increased 5.2% during 2019 compared to 2018 and increased 3.5% during 2018 compared to 2017. consolidated surgeries increased 3.7% during 2019 compared to 2018 and increased 2.6% during 2018 compared to 2017. consolidated emergency room visits increased 4.5% during 2019 compared to 2018 and increased 1.6% during 2018 compared to 2017.
same facility admissions increased 2.8% during 2019 compared to 2018 and increased 2.5% during 2018 compared to 2017. same facility surgeries each increased 1.4% during 2019 compared to 2018 and during 2018 compared to 2017. same facility emergency room visits increased 2.8% during 2019 compared to 2018 and increased 0.1% during 2018 compared to 2017.
same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 3.9% and same facility uninsured admissions increased 3.7% during 2019 compared to 2018. same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 3.8% and same facility uninsured admissions increased 8.5% during 2018 compared to 2017.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
at december 31, 2019, we owned and operated 45 hospitals and 33 surgery centers in the state of florida. our florida facilities' revenues totaled $11.494 billion, $10.892 billion and $10.168 billion for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. at december 31, 2019, we owned and operated 46 hospitals and 29 surgery centers in the state of texas. our texas facilities' revenues totaled $13.101 billion, $12.023 billion and $10.634 billion for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. during 2019, 2018 and 2017, 56%, 57% and 56% of our admissions and 48%, 49% and 48%, respectively, of our revenues were generated by our florida and texas facilities. uninsured admissions in florida and texas represented 72%, 70% and 70% of our uninsured admissions during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
we receive a significant portion of our revenues from government health programs, principally medicare and medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. in december 2017, the centers for medicare & medicaid services ("cms") announced that it will phase out federal matching funds for designated state health programs under waivers granted under section 1115 of the social security act. texas currently operates its healthcare transformation and quality improvement program pursuant to a medicaid waiver. in december 2017, cms approved an extension of this waiver through september 30, 2022, but
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
indicated that it will phase out some of the federal funding. our texas medicaid revenues included medicaid supplemental waiver payments of $416 million, $450 million and $351 million during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
in addition, we receive supplemental payments in several other states. we are aware these supplemental payment programs are currently being reviewed by cms and certain state agencies, and that some states have made waiver requests to cms to replace their existing supplemental payment programs. it is possible these reviews and waiver requests will result in the restructuring of such supplemental payment programs and could result in the payment programs being reduced or eliminated. because deliberations about these programs are ongoing, we are unable to estimate the financial impact the program structure modifications, if any, may have on our results of operations.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
for results of operations comparisons relating to years ending december 31, 2018 and 2017, refer to our annual report on form 10-k, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2018, filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 21, 2019.
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements are paying our operating expenses, servicing our debt, capital expenditures on our existing properties, acquisitions of hospitals and other health care entities, repurchases of our common stock, distributions to stockholders and distributions to noncontrolling interests. our primary cash sources are cash flows from operating activities, issuances of debt and equity securities and dispositions of hospitals and other health care entities.
cash provided by operating activities totaled $7.602 billion in 2019 compared to $6.761 billion in 2018 and $5.426 billion in 2017. the $841 million increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily related to the increase in net income, excluding gains on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, of $222 million and increases related to income taxes of $322 million and depreciation and amortization of $318 million. the $1.335 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily related to the increase in net income, excluding gains on sales of facilities, of $1.309 billion. working capital totaled $3.439 billion at december 31, 2019 and $2.644 billion at december 31, 2018. the increase in working capital of $795 million is primarily related to a decline in long-term debt due within one year of $643 million. cash payments for interest and income taxes increased $147 million for 2019 compared to 2018 and declined $289 million for 2018 compared to 2017.
cash used in investing activities was $5.720 billion, $3.901 billion and $4.279 billion in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures were $4.158 billion in 2019, $3.573 billion in 2018 and $3.015 billion in 2017. we expended $1.682 billion, $1.253 billion and $1.212 billion for acquisitions of hospitals and health care entities during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. planned capital expenditures are expected to approximate $4.0 billion to $4.2 billion in 2020. at december 31, 2019, there were projects under construction which had an estimated additional cost to complete and equip over the next five years of approximately $3.0 billion. we expect to finance capital expenditures with internally generated and borrowed funds. cash received from sales of hospitals and health care entities declined $747 million for 2019 compared to 2018 primarily related to the receipt during 2018 of $758 million from the sale of the two hospitals in our oklahoma market.
cash used in financing activities totaled $1.771 billion in 2019, $3.075 billion in 2018 and $1.061 billion in 2017. during 2019, we had a net increase of $567 million in our indebtedness, paid dividends of $550 million and paid $1.031 billion for repurchases of common stock. during 2018, we had a net decline of $344 million in our indebtedness, paid dividends of $487 million and paid $1.530 billion for repurchases of common stock. during 2017, we had a net increase of $1.509 billion in our indebtedness and paid $2.051 billion for repurchases

liquidity and capital resources (continued)
we, or our affiliates, may in the future repurchase portions of our debt or equity securities, subject to certain limitations, from time to time in either the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable sec and other legal requirements. the timing, prices, and sizes of purchases depend upon prevailing trading prices, general economic and market conditions, and other factors, including applicable securities laws. during january 2020 and 2019, our board of directors authorized share repurchase programs for up to $4 billion ($2 billion for each authorization) of our outstanding common stock, and at december 31, 2019, there was $1.241 billion of share repurchase authorization that remained available under the january 2019 authorization. funds for the repurchase of debt or equity securities have, and are expected to, come primarily from cash generated from operations and borrowed funds. on january 27, 2020, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share on our common stock payable on march 31, 2020 to stockholders of record at the close of business on march 2, 2020. during 2019, our board of directors declared four quarterly dividends of $0.40 per share, or $1.60 per share in the aggregate, on our common stock. the timing and amount of future cash dividends will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, share repurchases and investing in our existing markets, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of stockholders and are in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements of the company.
in addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of capital include amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities ($3.237 billion as of december 31, 2019 and $3.187 billion as of january 31, 2020) and anticipated access to public and private debt and equity markets.
investments of our insurance subsidiaries, held to maintain statutory equity levels and to provide liquidity to pay claims, totaled $462 million and $409 million at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the insurance subsidiary maintained net reserves for professional liability risks of $175 million and $183 million at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence; however, this coverage is subject, in most cases, to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. net reserves for the self-insured professional liability risks retained were $1.606 billion and $1.509 billion at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. claims payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, during the next 12 months are expected to approximate $448 million. we estimate that approximately $394 million of the expected net claim payments during the next 12 months will relate to claims subject to the self-insured retention.
financing activities we are a highly leveraged company with significant debt service requirements. our debt totaled $33.722 billion and $32.821 billion at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. our interest expense was $1.824 billion for 2019 and $1.755 billion for 2018.

financing activities (continued)
funding the purchase of a hospital, and the redemption of all $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of our existing 3.750% senior secured notes maturing in march 2019.
during january 2019, we issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes comprised of $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.875% notes due 2029 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% notes due 2028. we used the net proceeds to fund the purchase of a seven-hospital health system located in western north carolina.
management believes that cash flows from operations, amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities and our anticipated access to public and private debt markets will be sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs during the next twelve months.

(a)   we have not included obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits of $550 million at december 31, 2019, as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of cash payments, if any, at this time.
(c)   the estimation of the timing of payments for professional liability risks beyond a year can vary significantly. the time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated.
(d)   amounts include physician commitments that are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. amounts also include future other obligations that are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet.
(e)   amounts relate primarily to instances in which we have agreed to indemnify various commercial insurers and lenders who have provided surety bonds and letters of credit to cover damages for legal cases which were awarded to plaintiffs by the courts, medicaid provider bonds, educational administrative bonds and utility and construction deposits.
(f)   in consideration for physicians relocating to the communities in which our hospitals are located and agreeing to engage in private practice for the benefit of the respective communities, we make advances to physicians to assist in establishing the physicians' practices. the actual amount of these commitments to be advanced often depends upon the financial results of the physicians' private practice during the recruitment agreement payment period. the physician commitments reflected were based on our maximum exposure on effective agreements at december 31, 2019.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. the investments in our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries were $462 million at december 31, 2019. these investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. at december 31, 2019, we had a net unrealized gain of $18 million on the insurance subsidiaries' investment securities.
we are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. investments in debt and equity securities of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. should the 100% owned insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. we may be required to recognize credit-related impairments on our investment securities in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue-specific factors.
we are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. the notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities. our credit risk related to these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions. the interest payments under these agreements are settled on a net basis. these derivatives have been recognized in the financial statements at their respective fair values. changes in the fair value of these derivatives, which are designated as cash flow hedges, are included in other comprehensive income.
with respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, approximately $3.706 billion of long-term debt at december 31, 2019 was subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining balance in long-term debt of $30.016 billion at december 31, 2019 was subject to fixed rates of interest. both the general level of interest rates and, for the senior secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable interest rates. our variable debt is comprised primarily of amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities. borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (2) the prime rate of bank of america or (b) a libor rate for the currency of such borrowing for the relevant interest period. the applicable margin for borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities may fluctuate according to a leverage ratio. the average effective interest rate for our long-term debt was 5.3% for both 2019 and 2018, respectively.
the estimated fair value of our total long-term debt was $37.026 billion at december 31, 2019. the estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities. based on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates, the potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would be approximately $37 million. to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, we generally target a majority of our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates.
we are exposed to currency translation risk related to our foreign operations. we currently do not consider the market risk related to foreign currency translation to be material to our consolidated financial statements or our liquidity.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
financial instruments derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks, including interest rate exposures, and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. we recognize derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically either in earnings or in stockholders' equity, as a component of other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the hedged items when they occur.
effects of inflation and changing prices various federal, state and local laws have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices. revenues for general, acute care hospital services rendered to medicare patients are established under the federal government's prospective payment system. total fee-for-service medicare revenues were 21.0%, 21.1% and 21.3% of our revenues for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
management believes hospital industry operating margins have been, and may continue to be, under significant pressure because of changes in payer and service mix and growth in operating expenses in excess of the increase in prospective payments under the medicare program. in addition, as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures, our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to non-medicare patients is limited.
tax examinations the internal revenue service began an examination of the company's 2016 and 2017 federal income tax returns during 2019. we are also subject to examination by state and foreign taxing authorities. management believes hca healthcare, inc., its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the irs, state and foreign taxing authorities, and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. however, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

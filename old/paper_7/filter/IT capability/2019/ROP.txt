we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. our acquisitions have represented both new strategic platforms and additions to existing businesses.
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap"). a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2019 included in this annual report.
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures.
the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors. the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec. although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. if an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment.
our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory valuation, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition, income taxes, valuation of other intangible assets and goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment analyses. these issues affect each of our business segments and are evaluated using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting.
accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. the returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns, exchanges, discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue. the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. at december 31, 2019, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $16.9 and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $3.4, for a total of $20.3, or 2.5% of total gross accounts receivable, as compared to a total of $23.1, or 3.2% of total gross accounts receivable, at december 31, 2018. this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible.
we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. when we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. at december 31, 2019, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $33.4, or 14.4% of gross inventory cost, as compared to $30.3, or 13.7% of gross inventory cost, at december 31, 2018. the inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory.
most of our product-based revenues are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 to 24 months. future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net revenues for each of the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the u.s., combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. during 2019, our effective income tax rate was 20.6%, as compared to the 2018 rate of 21.2%. the decrease was due primarily to the recognition of a discrete tax benefit of $41.0 in connection with a foreign restructuring plan allowing the future realization of net operating losses and the reversal of the deferred tax liability of $10.0 originally recorded in the second quarter of 2018 associated with the excess of gatan's book basis over our tax basis in the shares during the third quarter of 2019, partially offset by the higher income tax rate incurred on the imaging and gatan gains. we expect the effective tax rate for 2020 to be between 21% and 23%.
we account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. goodwill, which is not amortized, is tested for impairment on an annual basis in conjunction with our annual forecast process during the fourth quarter (or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value).
when testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than not, we are then required to perform the quantitative impairment test; otherwise, no further analysis is required. under the qualitative assessment, we consider various qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, relevant industry and market trends, cost factors, overall financial performance, other entity-specific events and events affecting the reporting unit that could indicate a potential change in the fair value of our reporting unit or the composition of its carrying values. we also consider the specific future outlook for the reporting unit.
we also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. the quantitative assessment utilizes both an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (consisting of a comparable company earnings multiples methodology) to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. to determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values, we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations. if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, a non-cash impairment loss is recognized in the amount of that excess.
key assumptions used in the income and market approaches are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit. various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results, strategic plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the weighted-average cost of capital, comparable transactions, market data and earnings multiples. while we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly and could result in future non-cash impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances.
recently acquired reporting units generally represent a higher inherent risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise. negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, actual results significantly below projections, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units.
roper has 35 reporting units with individual goodwill amounts ranging from zero to $2.5 billion. in 2019, the company performed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter for all reporting units. the company conducted its analysis qualitatively and assessed whether it was more likely than not that the respective fair value of these reporting units was less than the carrying amount. the company determined that impairment of goodwill was not likely in 33 of its reporting units and thus was not required to perform a quantitative assessment for these reporting units. for the remaining two reporting units, the company performed its quantitative assessment and concluded that the fair value of each of these two reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value, with no impairment indicated as of october 1, 2019.
trade names that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that indicates the fair value is more likely than not below the carrying value. we first qualitatively assess whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived trade name is less than its carrying amount. if necessary, we conduct a quantitative assessment using the relief-from-royalty method, which we believe to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuation specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets. this methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third-party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these assets. the fair value of each trade name is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net revenues discounted using a risk-adjusted rate of capital. each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the trade name to which it relates and observed market royalty rates. revenue growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions, recent sales trends, discussions with customers, planned timing of new product launches or other variables. trade names resulting from recent acquisitions generally represent the highest risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into our enterprise and positioned for future sales growth.
the company performed a quantitative analysis over the fair values of two of its trade names and concluded that the fair value exceeded its carrying value, with no impairment indicated as of october 1, 2019. of those trade names subjected to our quantitative analysis, one, associated with our lab software business, had a fair value that approximated its carrying value, which was $100.4 as of october 1, 2019. holding other assumptions constant, for the specific trade name associated with our lab software business, a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a $5.5 impairment and a 100 basis point decrease in the terminal growth rate would result in an $9.7 impairment.
the assessment of fair value for impairment purposes requires significant judgments to be made by management. although our forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management uses to operate the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment in determining the expected results attributable to the businesses and/or reporting units. changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. no impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2019.
the most significant identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives recognized from our acquisitions are customer relationships. the fair value for customer relationships is determined as of the acquisition date using the excess earnings method. under this methodology the fair value is determined based on the estimated future after-tax cash flows arising from the acquired customer relationships over their estimated lives after considering customer attrition and contributory asset charges. when testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment, management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition. in evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets, management considers historical customer attrition patterns.
we evaluate whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives, or of the remaining life of such assets, when certain indicators of impairment are present. in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. if an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset's carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required.

net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019 were $5.37 billion as compared to $5.19 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018, an increase of 3.4%. the increase was the result of organic growth of 2.8% and a net effect from acquisitions and divestitures of 1.4%, partially offset by a negative foreign exchange impact of 0.8%.
in our application software segment, net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased by $135.3 or 9% over the year ended december 31, 2018. organic revenues increased by 5% and acquisitions accounted for 5% of our growth, partially offset by a negative foreign exchange impact of 1%. the growth in organic revenues was due primarily to broad-based revenue growth across the segment, led by businesses serving government contracting, professional services, legal and healthcare markets. gross margin remained relatively flat at 67.0% for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 66.9% for the year ended december 31, 2018. selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses as a percentage of revenues in the year ended december 31, 2019 decreased to 41.5%, as compared to 42.3% in the year ended december 31, 2018, due primarily to operating leverage on higher organic revenues. the resulting operating margin was 25.5% in the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 24.6% in the year ended december 31, 2018.
our network software & systems segment reported a $184.3 or 14% increase in net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019 over the year ended december 31, 2018. organic revenues increased by 5% and acquisitions accounted for 8% of our growth. the growth in organic revenues was due to broad-based revenue growth across the segment led by our network software businesses serving the transportation, healthcare and food markets. gross margin increased to 69.2% for the year ended december 31, 2019 from 68.3% for the year ended december 31, 2018, due primarily to revenue mix. sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 34.0% in the year ended december 31, 2019, as compared to 32.3% in the year ended december 31, 2018, due primarily to the acquisitions completed in 2019, including amortization of acquired intangibles. the resulting operating margin was 35.2% in the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 36.0% in the year ended december 31, 2018.
in our process technologies segment, net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019 decreased by $34.8 or 5% from the year ended december 31, 2018. organic sales decreased by 4% and the negative foreign exchange impact was 1%. the decrease in organic revenues was due primarily to lower demand at our businesses serving upstream oil and gas end markets. gross margin increased to 56.9% in the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 56.4% in the year ended december 31, 2018, due primarily to revenue mix. sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 22.3% in the year ended december 31, 2019, as compared to 22.5% in the year ended december 31, 2018, due primarily to lower costs that are generally variable with revenue. as a result, operating margin was 34.6% in the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to 34.0% in the year ended december 31, 2018.
corporate expenses decreased by $31.1 to $172.4, or 3.2% of revenues, in 2019 as compared to $203.5, or 3.9% of revenues, in 2018. the decrease was due primarily to $35.0 of accelerated vesting associated with the passing of our former executive chairman incurred in 2018, partially offset by higher acquisition-related expenses.
loss on debt extinguishment of $15.9 for the year ended december 31, 2018, incurred in connection with the early redemption of the $500.0 aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes due september 1, 2019, was composed of the early redemption premium and remaining unamortized deferred financing costs.
during 2019, our effective income tax rate was 20.6% as compared to our 2018 rate of 21.2%. the decrease was due primarily to the recognition of a discrete tax benefit of $41.0 in connection with a foreign restructuring plan allowing the future realization of net operating losses and the reversal of the deferred tax liability of $10.0 originally recorded in the second quarter of 2018 associated with the excess of gatan's book basis over our tax basis in the shares during the third quarter of 2019, partially offset by the higher income tax rate incurred on the imaging and gatan gains.
order backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized within the next 12 months as discussed in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2018 were $5.19 billion as compared to $4.61 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of 12.7%. the increase was the result of organic growth of 9.4%, a net effect from acquisitions and divestitures of 2.9%, and foreign exchange benefit of 0.4%.
in our application software segment, net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2018 increased by $230.5 or 19% over the year ended december 31, 2017. organic revenues increased by 9% and acquisitions accounted for 9%. the growth in organic revenues was due primarily to broad-based revenue growth across the segment, led by businesses serving government contracting, professional services, legal and healthcare markets, and the non-recurrence of purchase accounting adjustments to acquired deferred revenues in the year ended december 31, 2017 associated with our 2016 deltek acquisition. gross margin was 66.9% for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to 65.3% for the year ended december 31, 2017, due primarily to operating leverage on higher revenues. sg&a expenses were relatively flat as a percentage of revenues at 42.3% for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to 42.4% for the year ended december 31, 2017. the resulting operating margin was 24.6% in 2018 as compared to 22.8% in 2017.
in our network software & systems segment, net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2018 increased by $91.1 or 7% over the year ended december 31, 2017. organic revenues increased by 6% and acquisitions accounted for 1%. the growth in organic revenues was due to broad-based revenue growth across the segment led by our network software businesses serving the transportation markets and the non-recurrence of purchase accounting adjustments to acquired deferred revenues in the year ended december 31, 2017 associated with our 2016 constructconnect acquisition. gross margin increased to 68.3% for the year ended december 31, 2018 from 66.6% for the year ended december 31, 2017, due primarily to operating leverage on higher revenues. sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 32.3% in the year ended december 31, 2018, as compared to 31.6% in the year ended december 31, 2017, due primarily to the acquisitions completed in 2018, including amortization of acquired intangibles. the resulting operating margin was 36.0% in the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to 35.0% in the year ended december 31, 2017.
in our measurement & analytical solutions segment, net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2018 increased by $174.3 or 11% over the year ended december 31, 2017. organic revenues increased by 11% and the foreign exchange benefit was 1%. the growth in organic revenues was due to broad-based revenue growth across the segment led by our scientific imaging, water meter technology and medical products businesses. gross margin increased to 58.7% for the year ended december 31, 2018 from 58.4% for the year ended december 31, 2017 and sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 27.9% in the year ended december 31, 2018, as compared to 29.3% in the year ended december 31, 2017, due primarily to operating leverage on higher sales volume. the resulting operating margin was 30.7% in the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to 29.1% in the year ended december 31, 2017.
in our process technologies segment, net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2018 increased by $87.8 or 15% from the year ended december 31, 2017. organic sales increased by 14% and the benefit from foreign exchange was 1%. the growth in organic revenues was due to broad-based growth in our businesses serving energy and industrial end markets. gross margin increased to 56.4% in the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to 56.3% in the year ended december 31, 2017 and sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 22.5% in the year ended december 31, 2018, as compared to 24.9% in the year ended december 31, 2017, both of which were due to operating leverage on higher sales volume. as a result, operating margin was 34.0% in the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to 31.4% in the year ended december 31, 2017.
order backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized within the next 12 months as discussed in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
financial condition, liquidity and capital resources all currency amounts are in millions unless specified selected cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:
operating activities             $1,461.8              $1,430.1              $1,234.5
investing activities             (1,296.0   )          (1,335.1   )            (209.6   )
financing activities                177.0                (388.1   )          (1,170.0   )
operating activities - the growth in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 and in 2018 was primarily due to increased earnings net of non-cash expenses, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid in 2019, most notably cash taxes paid on the gain on sale of the imaging businesses.
investing activities - cash used in investing activities during 2019 was primarily for business acquisitions, most notably ipipeline and foundry, partially offset by proceeds from the disposal of the gatan business and the imaging businesses. cash used in investing activities during 2018 was primarily for business acquisitions, most notably powerplan.
financing activities - cash provided by/(used in) financing activities in all periods presented was primarily debt repayments/borrowings as well as dividends paid to stockholders. cash provided by financing activities during 2019 was primarily from the issuance of $1.2 billion of senior notes partially offset by $865.0 of revolving debt repayments and to a lesser extent dividend payments. cash used in financing activities during 2018 was primarily from the pay-down of revolving debt borrowings of $405.0, partially offset by the net issuance of senior notes of $200.0 and dividends paid to shareholders.
net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was negative $505.4 at december 31, 2019 compared to negative $200.4 at december 31, 2018, due primarily to increased income taxes payable, deferred revenue, and the adoption of asc 842, partially offset by increased accounts receivable. the increase in income taxes payable is due primarily to the approximately $200.0 of taxes incurred on the gain associated with the divestiture of gatan. we expect to pay these taxes in the second quarter of 2020. the deferred revenue increase is due to a higher percentage of revenue from software and subscription-based services.
total debt excluding unamortized debt issuance costs was $5.3 billion at december 31, 2019 (35.9% of total capital) compared to $5.0 billion at december 31, 2018 (39.1% of total capital). our increased total debt at december 31, 2019 compared to december 31, 2018 was due primarily to the issuance of $500.0 of 2.35% senior unsecured notes and $700.0 of 2.95% senior unsecured notes, partially offset by the pay-down of revolving debt borrowings of $865.0.
on september 23, 2016, we entered into a five-year unsecured credit facility, as amended as of december 2, 2016 (the "2016 facility") with jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders, which replaced our previous unsecured credit facility, dated as of july 27, 2012, as amended as of october 28, 2015 (the "2012 facility"). the 2016 facility comprises a five year $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which includes availability of up to $150.0 for letters of credit. we may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request term loans or additional revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $500.0.
the 2016 facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, enter into certain mergers and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. we also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. the most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 3.5 to 1.
the 2016 facility provides that the consolidated total leverage ratio may be increased, no more than twice during the term of the 2016 facility, to 4.00 to 1 for a consecutive four quarter fiscal period per increase (or, for any portion of such four quarter fiscal period in which the maximum would be 4.25 to 1).  in conjunction with the deltek acquisition in december of 2016, we increased the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio covenant to 4.25 to 1 through june 30, 2017 and 4.00 to 1 through december 31, 2017.
at december 31, 2019, we had $5.3 billion of senior unsecured notes and $0.0 of outstanding revolver borrowings. in addition, we had $7.7 of other debt in the form of finance leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our non-u.s. businesses. we had $74.0 of outstanding letters of credit at december 31, 2019, of which $35.8 was covered by our lending group, thereby reducing our revolving credit capacity commensurately.
we may redeem some or all of our senior secured notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium based on a spread to u.s. treasury securities.
we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facility throughout the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018.
see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding our credit facility and senior notes.
cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries at december 31, 2019 totaled $291.8 as compared to $339.0 at december 31, 2018, a decrease of 13.9%. the decrease was due primarily to the repatriation of $290.6 during the year and cash used in the acquisition of foundry, partially offset by cash generated from foreign operations. we intend to repatriate substantially all historical and future earnings subject to the deemed repatriation tax.
capital expenditures of $52.7, $49.1 and $48.8 were incurred during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. capitalized software expenditures of $10.2, $9.5 and $10.8 were incurred during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures were relatively consistent in 2019 as compared to 2018 and 2017. in the future, we expect the aggregate of capital expenditures and capitalized software expenditures as a percentage of annual net revenues to be between 1.0% and 1.5%.
contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies all currency amounts are in millions the following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december 31, 2019.

1 we have excluded the liability for uncertain tax positions and certain other tax liabilities as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments. see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facility will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements. although we maintain an active acquisition program, any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources.
we anticipate that our businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. however, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2020 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. none of these factors can be predicted with certainty.
off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2019 and 2018, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

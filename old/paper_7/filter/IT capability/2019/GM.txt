item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this md&a should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes. forward-looking statements in this md&a are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. refer to the "forward-looking statements" section of this md&a and item 1a. risk factors for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties. the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2017 included in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018 is incorporated by reference into this md&a.
non-gaap measures unless otherwise indicated, our non-gaap measures discussed in this md&a are related to our continuing operations and not our discontinued operations. our non-gaap measures include: earnings before interest and taxes (ebit)-adjusted, presented net of noncontrolling interests; earnings before income taxes (ebt)-adjusted for our gm financial segment; earnings per share (eps)-diluted-adjusted; effective tax rate-adjusted (etr-adjusted); return on invested capital-adjusted (roic-adjusted) and adjusted automotive free cash flow. our calculation of these non-gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. as a result, the use of these non-gaap measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related u.s. gaap measures.
these non-gaap measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. furthermore, these non-gaap measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment
general motors company and subsidiaries decisions being made by management to improve roic-adjusted. management uses these measures in its financial, investment and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. further, our board of directors uses certain of these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our performance-based compensation plans. for these reasons we believe these non-gaap measures are useful for our investors.
ebit-adjusted ebit-adjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income, automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations. examples of adjustments to ebit include but are not limited to impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions; costs arising from the ignition switch recall and related legal matters; and certain currency devaluations associated with hyperinflationary economies. for ebit-adjusted and our other non-gaap measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-gaap measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. our corresponding measure for our gm financial segment is ebt-adjusted.
eps-diluted-adjusted eps-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted eps results on a consistent basis. eps-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders-diluted less income (loss) from discontinued operations on an after-tax basis, adjustments noted above for ebit-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted. examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or reversal of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.
etr-adjusted etr-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. etr-adjusted is calculated as income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for ebit-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for eps-diluted-adjusted divided by income before income taxes less adjustments. when we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the u.s. gaap measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.
roic-adjusted roic-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital allocation decisions. we define roic-adjusted as ebit-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by roic-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits (opeb) liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period. adjustments to the average equity balances exclude assets and liabilities classified as either assets held for sale or liabilities held for sale.
adjusted automotive free cash flow adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. we measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. management actions can include voluntary events such as discretionary contributions to employee benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for ebit-adjusted purposes. refer to the "liquidity and capital resources" section of this md&a for additional information.

overview our management team has adopted a strategic plan to transform gm into the world's most valued automotive company. our plan includes several major initiatives that we anticipate will redefine the future of personal mobility and advance our vision of zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion while also strengthening the core of our business: earning customers for life by delivering winning vehicles, leading the industry in quality and safety and improving the customer ownership experience; leading in technology and innovation, including electrification, autonomous vehicles and data connectivity; growing our brands; making tough, strategic decisions about the markets and products in which we will invest and compete; building profitable adjacent businesses; and targeting 10% core margins on an ebit-adjusted basis.
our collective bargaining agreement with the uaw, which was ratified in november 2015, expired on september 14, 2019. the uaw went on strike on september 16, 2019, causing subsequent stoppages to most vehicle production and parts distribution across our north america facilities. on october 25, 2019, the uaw ratified a new collectively bargained labor agreement (labor agreement). the labor agreement, which has a term of four years, covers the wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment for our uaw-represented employees. the key terms and provisions of the labor agreement are:
•   detroit hamtramck assembly facility will remain open and receive a new product allocation. lordstown assembly, baltimore transmission and warren transmission facilities will close;
•   cash severance incentive programs to qualified employees based on employee interest, eligibility and management approval; and
•   additional manufacturing investments of approximately $7.7 billion to create or retain more than 9,000 uaw jobs during the period of the labor agreement.
lump sum payments are amortized over the term of the labor agreement. restructuring charges for cash severance incentive programs were recorded in the three months ended december 31, 2019 upon receipt of both employee acceptance and management approval. we expect to offset the labor agreement's economics with productivity over the four-year contract period.
we estimate that the lost vehicle production volumes and parts sales due to the uaw strike had an unfavorable impact of approximately $3.6 billion on our gmna ebit-adjusted in the year ended december 31, 2019. in addition, we estimate an unfavorable pre-tax impact to net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows of approximately $5.4 billion in the year ended december 31, 2019.
we face continuing market, operating and regulatory challenges in a number of countries across the globe due to, among other factors, weak economic conditions, competitive pressures, our product portfolio offerings, heightened emissions standards, labor disruptions, foreign exchange volatility, rising material prices, evolving trade policy and political uncertainty. as a result of these conditions, we continue to strategically assess our performance and ability to achieve acceptable returns on our invested capital, as well as our cost structure in order to maintain a low breakeven point. refer to item 1a. risk factors for a discussion on these challenges.
in november 2018, we announced plans to accelerate steps to improve our overall business performance, including the reorganization of global product development staffs, the realignment of manufacturing capacity in response to market-related volume declines in passenger cars and a reduction of our salaried workforce. we expect these transformation activities to drive between $5.5 billion and $6.0 billion of annual cash savings by the end of 2020, consisting of $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion in cost savings resulting from reductions primarily in automotive and other cost of sales in our consolidated financial statements, with the remainder in reduced capital expenditures. we have achieved $3.3 billion in cost savings since inception through staffing, manufacturing and product initiatives. we are on track to reduce capital expenditures from approximately $8.5 billion to approximately $7.0 billion and expect to meet our revised cost savings target by the end of 2020. as we continue to assess our performance and the needs of our evolving business, additional restructuring and rationalization actions could be required. these additional actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may have a material impact on our results of operations. we have recorded charges of $1.8 billion in 2019 and $3.1 billion cumulatively related to our 2018 transformation plans, which were complete at december 31, 2019. these charges are primarily considered special for ebit-adjusted, eps diluted-adjusted and adjusted automotive free cash flow purposes.
gmna industry sales in north america were 21.2 million units in the year ended december 31, 2019, representing a decrease of 1.8% compared to the corresponding period in 2018. u.s. industry sales were 17.5 million units in the year ended december 31, 2019, representing a decrease of 1.1% compared to the corresponding period in 2018.
our total vehicle sales in the u.s., our largest market in north america, totaled 2.9 million units for a market share of 16.5% in the year ended december 31, 2019, representing a decrease of 0.2 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2018, primarily related to the uaw strike. we continue to lead the u.s. industry in market share.
we estimate gmna's breakeven point at the u.s. industry level to be in the range of 10.0 to 11.0 million units. we expect to sustain a strong ebit-adjusted margin in 2020 on the relative strength of u.s. industry light vehicle sales and our recent and upcoming product launches, including our new full-size suvs.
gmi industry sales in china were 25.4 million units in the year ended december 31, 2019, representing a decrease of 4.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2018. our total vehicle sales in china were 3.1 million units for a market share of 12.2% in the year ended december 31, 2019, representing a decrease of 1.6 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2018. cadillac achieved 3.9% growth in vehicle sales in the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to the corresponding period in 2018. buick, chevrolet, baojun and wuling sales were softer amid a continued weak automotive industry since the second half of 2018. additionally, baojun and wuling sales were impacted by unfavorable market shifts in vehicle segments. our automotive china jvs generated equity income of $1.1 billion in the year ended december 31, 2019. in 2020 we expect to see continued weakness in the industry with a continuation of pricing pressures, a more challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and new energy vehicles, and continued weakness in the chinese yuan against the u.s. dollar, which will continue to put pressure on our operations in china. we will continue to build upon our strong brands, network, and partnerships in china as well as continue to drive improvements in vehicle mix and cost.
outside of china, industry sales were 25.8 million units in the year ended december 31, 2019, representing a decrease of 3.5% compared to the corresponding period in 2018, primarily due to decreased sales in india and argentina. our total vehicle sales were 1.3 million units for a market share of 4.9% in the year ended december 31, 2019, representing an increase of 0.2 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2018.
general motors company and subsidiaries in 2019 cruise holdings entered into a purchase agreement with existing shareholders and new third-party investors, pursuant to which cruise holdings received $1.2 billion in exchange for issuing cruise class f preferred shares, including $0.7 billion from general motors holdings llc. all proceeds are designated exclusively for working capital and general corporate purposes of cruise. refer to note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for further details.
corporate  the ignition switch recall has led to various inquiries, investigations, subpoenas, requests for information and complaints from agencies or other representatives of u.s., federal, state and canadian governments. in addition these and other recalls have resulted in a number of claims and lawsuits. such lawsuits and investigations could result in the imposition of material damages, fines, civil consent orders, civil and criminal penalties or other remedies. refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
automotive financing - gm financial summary and outlook we believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental gm financial earnings and help support our sales throughout various economic cycles. gm financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. used vehicle prices decreased 3% in 2019 compared to 2018. we expect a decrease of 3% to 4% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the elevated supply of used vehicles in the industry. the following table summarizes the residual value as well as the number of units included in gm financial equipment on operating leases, net by vehicle type (units in thousands):
residual value            units           percentage       residual value            units           percentage crossovers       $15,950                972              60.5       %       $15,057                917              53.8       %
consolidated results we review changes in our results of operations under five categories: volume, mix, price, cost and other. volume measures the impact of changes in wholesale vehicle volumes driven by industry volume, market share and changes in dealer stock levels. mix measures the impact of changes to the regional portfolio due to product, model, trim, country and option penetration in current year wholesale vehicle volumes. price measures the impact of changes related to manufacturer's suggested retail price and various sales allowances. cost primarily includes: (1) material and freight; (2) manufacturing, engineering, advertising, administrative and selling and warranty expense; and (3) non-vehicle related activity. other primarily includes foreign exchange and non-vehicle related automotive revenues as well as equity income or loss from our nonconsolidated affiliates. refer to the regional sections of this md&a for additional information.
factors that most significantly influence a region's profitability are industry volume, market share, and the relative mix of vehicles (trucks, crossovers, cars) sold. variable profit is a key indicator of product profitability. variable profit is defined as revenue less material cost, freight, the variable component of manufacturing expense and warranty and recall-related costs. vehicles with higher selling prices generally have higher variable profit. refer to the regional sections of this md&a for additional information on volume and mix.
in the year ended december 31, 2019, favorable cost was primarily due to: (1) decreased engineering, manufacturing and other costs of $1.5 billion, primarily related to cost savings associated with transformation activities; (2) a benefit of $1.4 billion related to the retrospective recoveries of indirect taxes in brazil; (3) charges of $1.1 billion primarily in employee separation charges and asset impairments in korea in 2018; and (4) favorable material performance of $0.8 billion related to carryover vehicles; partially offset by (5) increased material cost of $1.2 billion related to vehicles launched within the last twelve months incorporating significant exterior and/or interior changes (majors); (6) increase in large campaigns and other warranty-related costs of $1.0 billion; (7) increased raw material and freight costs related to carryover vehicles of $0.5 billion; and (8) a net increase in charges of $0.4 billion primarily in accelerated depreciation and supplier-related charges resulting from transformation activities. in the year ended december 31, 2019 favorable other was due to the foreign currency effect resulting from the weakening of the brazilian real, korean won, argentine peso and other currencies against the u.s. dollar.
in the year ended december 31, 2019, automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense decreased primarily due to charges of $0.4 billion for ignition switch related legal matters in 2018 and decreased other costs of $0.5 billion primarily related to cost savings associated with transformation activities.
in the year ended december 31, 2019, interest income and other non-operating income, net decreased primarily due to decreased non-service pension income of $0.9 billion, losses related to our investment in lyft, inc. (lyft) of $0.2 billion and losses related to the faw-gm divestiture of $0.2 billion.
in the year ended december 31, 2019, income tax expense increased primarily due to the absence of certain tax benefits related to foreign dividends which occurred in 2018, partially offset by a decrease in 2019 pre-tax income, u.s. tax benefits from foreign activity and tax benefits related to the release of valuation allowances.
in the year ended december 31, 2018, income tax expense decreased primarily due to the absence of certain expense items which occurred in 2017, including $7.3 billion of tax expense related to u.s. tax reform and $2.3 billion of tax expense related to the recording of a valuation allowance on the sale of the opel/vauxhall business, combined with the impact of a lower u.s. statutory tax rate and pre-tax income in 2018.
for the year ended december 31, 2019 our etr-adjusted was 12.0%. we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 20% for the year ending december 31, 2020, primarily due to certain 2019 tax items that will not reoccur.
refer to note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to income tax expense.

gmna total net sales and revenue in the year ended december 31, 2019, total net sales and revenue decreased primarily due to: (1) decreased net wholesale volumes due to lost production resulting from the uaw strike, a decrease in sales of passenger cars, full-size suvs and fleet vehicles, partially offset by an increase in sales of crossover vehicles and higher planned downtime in 2018 in preparation for the launch of full-size pickup trucks; and (2) unfavorable other primarily due to the foreign currency effect resulting from the weakening of the canadian dollar against the u.s. dollar; partially offset by (3) favorable mix associated with a decrease in sales of passenger cars partially offset by a decrease in sales of full-size suvs; and (4) favorable pricing for majors of $1.3 billion associated with the launch of our new full-size pickup trucks.
gmna ebit-adjusted the most significant factors that influence profitability are industry volume and market share. while not as significant as industry volume and market share, another factor affecting profitability is the relative mix of vehicles sold. trucks, crossovers and cars sold currently have a variable profit of approximately 170%, 60% and 30% of our gmna portfolio on a weighted-average basis.
in the year ended december 31, 2019, ebit-adjusted decreased primarily due to: (1) decreased net wholesale volumes; and (2) unfavorable cost due to increased vehicle content for majors of $1.1 billion, an increase in large campaigns and other warranty-related cost of $1.1 billion, decreased non-service pension income of $0.7 billion, increased raw material and freight costs of $0.4 billion related to carryover vehicles, increased depreciation and amortization expense of $0.3 billion; partially offset by engineering, manufacturing and administrative cost savings of $1.8 billion primarily related to transformation activities and favorable materials performance of $0.7 billion related to carryover vehicles; partially offset by (3) favorable pricing.

cruise ebit (loss)-adjusted in the year ended december 31, 2019, ebit (loss)-adjusted increased primarily due to increased engineering costs as we progress towards the commercialization of autonomous vehicles.
liquidity and capital resources we believe that our current level of cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and availability under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. we expect to have substantial cash requirements going forward, which we plan to fund through total available liquidity and cash flows generated from operations and future debt issuances. we also maintain access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. our future uses of cash, which may vary from time to time based on market conditions and other factors, are focused on the three objectives of our capital allocation program: (1) reinvest in our business at an average target roic-adjusted rate of 20% or greater; (2) maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet, including a target average automotive cash balance of $18 billion; and (3) return available cash to shareholders. our senior management evaluates our capital allocation program on an ongoing basis and recommends any modifications to the program to our board of directors, not less than once annually.
our known current and future material uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital expenditures of approximately $7.0 billion in 2020 in addition to payments for engineering and product development activities; (2) payments associated with previously announced vehicle recalls, the settlements of the multi-district litigation and any other recall-related contingencies; (3) payments to service debt and other long-term obligations, including discretionary and mandatory contributions to our pension plans; (4) dividend payments on our common stock that are declared by our board of directors; and (5) payments to purchase shares of our common stock authorized by our board of directors.
our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the "forward-looking statements" section of this md&a and item 1a. risk factors, some of which are outside of our control.
we continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our competitive position over the long term while maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet. these actions may include opportunistic payments to reduce our long-term obligations, as well as the possibility of acquisitions, dispositions, investments with joint venture partners and strategic alliances that we believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business.
in january 2017 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the purchase of up to $5.0 billion of our common stock with no expiration date, as part of our common stock repurchase program. we have completed $1.6 billion of the $5.0 billion program through december 31, 2019.
cash flows occur amongst our automotive, cruise and gm financial operations that are eliminated when we consolidate our cash flows. such eliminations include, among other things, collections by automotive on wholesale accounts receivables financed by dealers through gm financial, payments between automotive and gm financial for accounts receivables transferred by automotive to gm financial, dividends issued by gm financial to automotive and automotive cash injections in cruise. the presentation of automotive liquidity, cruise liquidity and gm financial liquidity presented below includes the impact of cash transactions amongst the sectors that are ultimately eliminated in consolidation.
automotive liquidity total available liquidity includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and funds available under credit facilities. the amount of available liquidity is subject to seasonal fluctuations and includes balances held by various business units and subsidiaries worldwide that are needed to fund their operations.
we manage our liquidity primarily at our treasury centers as well as at certain of our significant consolidated overseas subsidiaries. approximately 90% of our cash and marketable debt securities were managed within north america and at our regional treasury centers at december 31, 2019. we have used and will continue to use other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these funds across our global operations as needed.
our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities balances are primarily denominated in u.s. dollars and include investments in u.s. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits, corporate debt securities and mortgage and asset-backed securities. our investment guidelines, which we may change from time to time, prescribe certain minimum credit worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. the majority of our current investments in debt securities are with a/a2 or better rated issuers.
general motors company and subsidiaries we use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. at december 31, 2018 the total size of our credit facilities was $16.5 billion, which consisted principally of three primary revolving credit facilities. in january 2019, we entered into a fourth facility, increasing our aggregate borrowing capacity from $16.5 billion to $19.5 billion. these facilities consist of a three-year, $4.0 billion facility, a five-year, $10.5 billion facility, a 364-day, $2.0 billion facility and a three-year, $3.0 billion facility. the three-year, $4.0 billion facility allows for borrowings in u.s. dollars and other currencies and includes a letter of credit sub-facility of $1.1 billion. the five-year, $10.5 billion facility allows for borrowings in u.s. dollars and other currencies. gm financial has exclusive use of our 364-day, $2.0 billion credit facility, which allows for borrowing in u.s. dollars only and was renewed in april 2019 for an additional 364-day term. the new three-year unsecured revolving credit facility has an initial borrowing capacity of $3.0 billion, reducing to $2.0 billion in july 2020. the facility provides additional financial flexibility and was used in 2019 to fund transformation activities announced in november 2018 for $0.7 billion, which we repaid in full in 2019. total automotive borrowing capacity under the credit facility was $17.5 billion and $14.5 billion at december 31, 2019 and 2018. we did not have any borrowings against our other primary facilities at december 31, 2019 and 2018. we had letters of credit outstanding under our sub-facility of $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion at december 31, 2019 and 2018.
gm financial had access to our revolving credit facilities, except for the $3.0 billion facility executed in january 2019, but did not have borrowings outstanding against them at december 31, 2019. refer to note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on credit facilities. we had intercompany loans from gm financial of $0.5 billion and $0.6 billion at december 31, 2019 and 2018, which primarily consisted of commercial loans to dealers we consolidate, and we had no intercompany loans to gm financial. refer to note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
gm financial's board of directors declared and paid dividends of $0.4 billion on its common stock in october 2019 and 2018. future dividends from gm financial will depend on a number of factors including business and economic conditions, its financial condition, earnings, liquidity requirements and leverage ratio.
the following table summarizes our available liquidity (dollars in billions):

in the year ended december 31, 2019 net cash provided by financing activities decreased primarily due to a reduction in the issuance of preferred and common shares.
automotive financing - gm financial liquidity gm financial's primary sources of cash are finance charge income, leasing income and proceeds from the sale of terminated leased vehicles, net distributions from credit facilities, securitizations, secured and unsecured borrowings and collections and recoveries on finance receivables. gm financial's primary uses of cash are purchases of retail finance receivables and leased vehicles, the funding of commercial finance receivables, repayment of secured and unsecured debt, funding credit enhancement requirements in connection with securitizations and secured credit facilities, interest costs, and operating expenses. in 2018 gm financial issued $0.5 billion of fixed-to-floating rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series b, $0.01 par value, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. the following table summarizes gm financial's available liquidity (dollars in billions):
borrowing capacity on unpledged eligible assets                                       17.5                        18.0

total gm financial available liquidity                                               $23.1                       $25.2
in the year ended december 31, 2019, available liquidity decreased primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and increased credit facility utilization, resulting from a decrease in issuances of securitizations and unsecured debt. at december 31, 2019, available liquidity was in line with our liquidity targets.
gm financial has access to $16.5 billion of our revolving credit facilities with exclusive access to the 364-day, $2.0 billion facility. refer to the automotive liquidity section of this md&a for additional details. we have a support agreement with gm financial which, among other things, establishes commitments of funding from us to gm financial. this agreement also provides that we will continue to own all of gm financial's outstanding voting shares so long as any unsecured debt securities remain outstanding at gm financial. in addition we are required to use our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure gm financial remains a subsidiary borrower under our corporate revolving credit facilities.
credit facilities in the normal course of business, in addition to using its available cash, gm financial utilizes borrowings under its credit facilities, which may be secured or unsecured, and gm financial repays these borrowings as appropriate under its cash management strategy. at december 31, 2019 secured, committed unsecured and uncommitted unsecured credit facilities totaled $26.7 billion, $0.4 billion and $1.8 billion with advances outstanding of $6.2 billion, an insignificant amount and $1.8 billion.
net cash provided by operating activities             $8.1                     $7.4                  $6.5                   $0.7

in the year ended december 31, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to a decrease in net collateral posted for derivative positions of $0.8 billion as a result of favorable changes in interest rates on gm financial's collateralized derivative portfolio.
general motors company and subsidiaries in the year ended december 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities decreased primarily due to: (1) increased collections and recoveries on finance receivables of $6.2 billion; (2) decreased purchases of finance receivables of $3.6 billion; (3) increased proceeds from the termination of leased vehicles of $2.4 billion; and (4) decreased purchases of leased vehicles of $0.3 billion.
in the year ended december 31, 2019, net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to an increase in debt repayments of $9.2 billion, a decrease in borrowings of $4.8 billion and a decrease in proceeds from issuance of preferred stock of $0.5 billion.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not currently utilize off-balance sheet securitization arrangements. all trade or finance receivables and related obligations subject to securitization programs are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31, 2019 and 2018.
contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities we have minimum commitments under contractual obligations, including purchase obligations. a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased or fixed minimum price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction. based on these definitions, the following table includes only those contracts that include fixed or minimum obligations. the majority of our purchases are not included in the table as they are made under purchase orders that are requirements-based and accordingly do not specify minimum quantities. the following table summarizes aggregated information about our outstanding contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities at december 31, 2019:
postretirement benefits(c)                        252                 464                   231                       -                      947
other contractual commitments:
total contractual commitments(d)              $44,653             $39,910               $18,121                 $29,194                 $131,878
non-contractual benefits(e)                      $295                $529                  $708                  $9,945                  $11,477
(b)   gm financial interest payments were determined using the interest rate in effect at december 31, 2019 for floating rate debt and the contractual rates for fixed rate debt. gm financial interest payments on floating rate tranches of the securitization notes payable were converted to a fixed rate based on the floating rate plus any expected hedge payments.
(d)   amounts do not include future cash payments for purchase obligations and certain other accrued expenditures (unless specifically listed in the table above), which were recorded in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other liabilities at december 31, 2019.
(e)   amounts include all expected future payments for both current and expected future service at december 31, 2019 for opeb obligations for salaried and hourly employees extending beyond the current north american union contract agreements, workers' compensation and extended disability benefits. amounts do not include pension funding obligations, which are discussed in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.
the table above does not reflect product warranty and related liabilities, certified pre-owned, extended warranty and free maintenance of $8.6 billion and unrecognized tax benefits of $0.8 billion due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows
general motors company and subsidiaries potentially associated with these amounts. in addition, future cash outflows related to transformation activities announced in november 2018 are not included in the table above. refer to note 18 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. we believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.
product warranty and recall campaigns the estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. when little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based on comparable models.
the estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. these estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. these estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.
the estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate), and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. the estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. a 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.3 billion.
actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.
sales incentives the estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. a change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in automotive net sales and revenue.
valuation of gm financial equipment on operating leases assets and residuals gm financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases, which relate to vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms that typically range from two to five years. at the beginning of the lease an estimate is made of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term. the expected residual value is based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions. the customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of
we also evaluate the carrying value of the operating leases aggregated by vehicle make, year and model into leased asset groups, check for indicators of impairment and test for impairment to the extent necessary in accordance with applicable accounting standards. we believe no impairment indicators existed during 2019, 2018 or 2017.
pension and opeb plans our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement. our pension obligations include korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a walk away basis. the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return.
in december 2019 an investment policy study was completed for the u.s. pension plans. as a result of changes to our capital market assumptions the weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets decreased from 6.4% at december 31, 2018 to 5.9% at december 31, 2019. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-u.s. plans is determined in a similar manner to the u.s. plans.
another key assumption in determining net pension and opeb expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations. we estimate the assumed discount rate for u.s. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weighted-average discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows. we apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost, which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment.
general motors company and subsidiaries the society of actuaries (soa) issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended december 31, 2019. we reviewed our recent mortality experience and we determined our current mortality assumptions are appropriate to measure our december 31, 2019 u.s. pension and opeb plans obligations.
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. the effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods. the unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on our pension plans was $6.7 billion and $4.7 billion at december 31, 2019 and 2018. the year-over-year change is primarily due to a decrease in discount rates partially offset by higher than expected asset returns. at december 31, 2019, $3.0 billion of the unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss is outside the corridor (primarily 10% of the projected benefit obligation (pbo) and subject to amortization. the weighted-average amortization period for the pension obligation is approximately 16 years resulting in amortization expense of $0.2 billion in 2020.
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans, holding all other assumptions constant:
(a)   the sensitivity does not include the effects of the individual annual yield curve rates applied for the calculation of the service and interest cost.

valuation of deferred tax assets the ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. the assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events. changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated market conditions, governmental legislative actions or events, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets. refer to note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of these valuation allowances.
forward-looking statements this report and the other reports filed by us with the sec from time to time, as well as statements incorporated by reference herein and related comments by our management, may include "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the u.s. federal securities laws. forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact. forward-looking statements represent our current judgment about possible future events and are often identified by words like "aim," "anticipate," "appears," "approximately," "believe," "continue," "could," "designed," "effect," "estimate," "evaluate," "expect," "forecast," "goal," "initiative," "intend," "may," "objective," "outlook," "plan," "potential," "priorities," "project," "pursue," "seek," "should," "target," "when," "will," "would," or the negative of any of those words or similar expressions. in making these statements, we rely on assumptions and analysis based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. we believe these judgments are reasonable, but these statements are not guarantees of any events or financial results, and our actual results may differ materially due to a variety of important factors, both positive and negative. these factors, which may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports we file with the sec, include, among others, the following: (1) our ability to deliver new
general motors company and subsidiaries products, services and customer experiences in response to increased competition in the automotive industry; (2) our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers; (3) the success of our crossovers, suvs and full-size pickup trucks; (4) our ability to successfully and cost-effectively restructure our operations in the u.s. and various other countries and initiate additional cost reduction actions with minimal disruption; (5) our ability to reduce the cost of manufacturing electric vehicles and drive increased consumer adoption; (6) the unique technological, operational, regulatory and competitive risks related to the timing and commercialization of autonomous vehicles; (7) global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile; (8) our significant business in china, which is subject to unique operational, competitive, regulatory and economic risks; (9) our joint ventures, which we cannot operate solely for our benefit and over which we may have limited control; (10) the international scale and footprint of our operations, which exposes us to a variety of unique political, economic, competitive and regulatory risks, including the risk of changes in government leadership and laws (including labor, tax and other laws), political instability and economic tensions between governments and changes in international trade policies, new barriers to entry and changes to or withdrawals from free trade agreements, public health crises, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as the novel coronavirus, changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, economic downturns in foreign countries, differing local product preferences and product requirements, compliance with u.s. and foreign countries' export controls and economic sanctions, differing labor regulations, requirements and union relationships, differing dealer and franchise regulations and relationships, and difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries; (11) any significant disruption, including any work stoppages, at any of our manufacturing facilities; (12) the ability of our suppliers to deliver parts, systems and components without disruption and at such times to allow us to meet production schedules; (13) prices of raw materials used by us and our suppliers; (14) our highly competitive industry, which is characterized by excess manufacturing capacity and the use of incentives, and the introduction of new and improved vehicle models by our competitors; (15) the possibility that competitors may independently develop products and services similar to ours, or that our intellectual property rights are not sufficient to prevent competitors from developing or selling those products or services; (16) our ability to manage risks related to security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology systems and networked products, including connected vehicles and in-vehicle systems; (17) our ability to comply with increasingly complex, restrictive and punitive regulations relating to our enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing and security of the personal identifiable information of our customers, employees, or suppliers; (18) our ability to comply with extensive laws, regulations and policies applicable to our operations and products, including those relating to fuel economy and emissions and autonomous vehicles; (19) costs and risks associated with litigation and government investigations; (20) the costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services; (21) any additional tax expense or exposure; (22) our continued ability to develop captive financing capability through gm financial; and (23) any significant increase in our pension funding requirements. for a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties, refer to item 1a. risk factors.

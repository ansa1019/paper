item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item 8 of this form 10-k. this discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results that are subject to uncertainty. we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item 1a, risk factors in this form 10-k.
in march 2019, the sec amended its rules to modernize and simplify certain reporting requirements for public companies. as part of this change, registrants may exclude discussion of the earliest of the three years in management's discussion and analysis (md&a). for further discussion regarding our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2017, refer to item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018.
overview republic is the second largest provider of non-hazardous solid waste collection, transfer, disposal, recycling, and environmental services in the united states, as measured by revenue. as of december 31, 2019, we operated facilities in 41 states and puerto rico through 340 collection operations, 212 transfer stations, 189 active landfills, 79 recycling processing centers, 7 treatment, recovery and disposal facilities, 15 salt water disposal wells, and 4 deep injection wells. we are engaged in 75 landfill gas-to-energy and renewable energy projects and had post-closure responsibility for 130 closed landfills.
revenue for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased by 2.6% to $10,299.4 million compared to $10,040.9 million for the same period in 2018. this change in revenue is due to increases in total price, including fuel recovery fees, of 2.8% and acquisitions, net of divestitures of 0.8%, partially offset by the impact of decreased volumes of (0.4)%, environmental services of (0.3)%, and recycling processing and commodity sales of (0.3)%.
gain on business divestitures and impairments, net                              (14.7)                    (0.1)                        (44.9)                 (0.4)
during 2019 and 2018, we recorded a number of charges, other expenses and benefits that impacted our pre-tax income, net income attributable to republic services, inc. (net income - republic) and diluted earnings per share as noted in the following table (in millions, except per share data). additionally, see our cost of operations, selling, general and administrative expenses and income taxes discussions contained in the results of operations section of this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of other items that impacted our earnings during the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018.
gain on disposition of assets and asset impairments, net                     (14.7)                          (8.7)                       (0.03)                      (44.9)                      (24.7)                    (0.08)

we believe that presenting adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income - republic, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are not measures determined in accordance with u.s. gaap, provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. we use these measures, and believe investors will find them helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. we have incurred comparable charges and costs in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. our definitions of adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income - republic, and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. further information on each of these adjustments is included below.
restructuring charges. in january 2018, we eliminated certain positions following the consolidation of select back-office functions, including but not limited to the integration of our national accounts support functions into our existing corporate support functions. these changes include a reduction in administrative staffing and the closure of certain office locations. during 2019, we incurred restructuring charges of $14.2 million that primarily related to the redesign of our back-office software systems. during 2018, we incurred restructuring charges of $26.4 million, that primarily consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits and the closure of offices with non-cancelable terms. we paid $10.6 million and $24.7 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to these restructuring efforts.
in 2020, we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $15 million primarily related to the redesign of our back-office software systems. substantially all of these restructuring charges will be recorded in our corporate segment.
gain on disposition of assets and asset impairments, net.  during 2019 and 2018, we recorded a net gain on disposition of assets and asset impairments related to business divestitures of $14.7 million and $44.9 million, respectively.
acquisition integration and deal costs. although our business regularly incurs costs related to acquisitions, we specifically identify in the table above integration and deal costs of $6.6 million incurred during 2019. we do this because of the magnitude of the costs associated with particular acquisition activity during 2019.
fire-damage related costs. during the three months ended december 31, 2019, certain of our owned and operated facilities in our group 1 segment were impacted by separate fire-related events. although our business may incur fire-related damage to our leased or owned property, plant and equipment from time to time, we specifically identify in the table above fire-damage related costs of $7.7 million incurred during 2019. we do this because of the magnitude of the costs incurred associated with these fires during 2019.
incremental contract start-up costs - large municipal contract. although our business regularly incurs startup costs under municipal contracts, we specifically identify in the table above the startup costs with respect to an individual municipal contract (and do not adjust for other startup costs under other contracts in 2019 or 2018). we do this because of the magnitude of the costs involved with this particular municipal contract and the unusual nature for the time period in which they were incurred. during 2019 and 2018, we incurred costs of $0.7 million and $5.7 million, respectively, related to the implementation of this large municipal contract. these costs did not meet the capitalization criteria prescribed by the new revenue recognition standard.
adoption of the tax act. the tax act was enacted on december 22, 2017. among other things, the tax act reduced the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. during 2018, we adjusted the provisional amounts recorded as of december 31, 2017 for the one-time transition tax, deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions. these adjustments increased our tax provision by $0.3 million.
bridgeton insurance recovery, net. during 2019 and 2018, we collected insurance recoveries of $24.0 million and $40.0 million, respectively, related to our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri, which we recognized as a reduction of remediation expenses in our cost of operations. in addition, we incurred $9.6 million and $12.0 million, respectively, of incremental costs attributable to the bridgeton insurance recoveries.
2020 financial guidance in 2020, we will continue to focus on managing the controllable aspects of our business by enhancing the quality of our revenue, investing in profitable growth opportunities and reducing costs. our team remains focused on executing our strategy to deliver consistent earnings and free cash flow growth, and improve return on invested capital. we are committed to an efficient capital structure, maintaining our investment grade credit ratings and increasing cash returned to our shareholders.
our guidance is based on current economic conditions and does not assume any significant changes in the overall economy in 2020. specific guidance follows:
recycling processing and commodity sales             (0.25) to 0.0
acquisitions / divestitures, net                               1.0
changes in price are restricted on approximately 50% of our annual service revenue. the majority of these restricted pricing arrangements are tied to fluctuations in a specific index (primarily a consumer price index) as defined in the contract. the consumer price index varies from a single historical stated period of time or an average of trailing historical rates over a stated period of time. in addition, the initial effect of pricing resets typically lags 6 to 12 months from the end of the index measurement period to the date the revised pricing goes into effect. as a result, current changes in a specific index may not manifest themselves in our reported pricing for several quarters into the future.
adjusted diluted earnings per share the following is a summary of anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ending december 31, 2020 compared to the actual adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2019. adjusted diluted earnings per share is not a measure determined in accordance with u.s. gaap:
withdrawal costs - multiemployer pension funds           0.01                                             -
gain on business divestitures and impairments, net       -                                           (0.03)
acquisition integration and deal costs                   -                                             0.02
the 2020 anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 21% and an approximately $110 million charge related to solar energy investments that qualify for tax credits. the charge will be recorded as a loss from unconsolidated equity method investments.
we believe that the presentation of adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes restructuring charges, (gain) loss on business divestitures and impairments, net, acquisition integration and deal costs, fire damage related costs, incremental contract startup costs, and certain insurance recoveries provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial effect of certain items. we use this measure, and believe investors will find it helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate effect on our results for a particular period. we have incurred comparable charges and costs in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. our definition of adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
results of operations revenue we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations. our remaining revenue is from other services, including transfer station, landfill disposal, recycling, and environmental services. our residential, small-container and large-container collection operations in some markets are based on long-term contracts with municipalities. certain of our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as a consumer price index. we generally provide small-container and large-container collection services to customers under contracts with terms up to three years. our transfer stations and landfills generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties. our recycling processing facilities generate revenue from tipping fees charged to third parties and the sale of recycled commodities. our revenue from environmental services consists mainly of fees we charge for disposal of non-hazardous solid and liquid waste and in-plant services, such as transportation and logistics. environmental services waste is generated from the by-product of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity. additionally, it is generated by the daily operations of industrial, petrochemical and refining facilities, including maintenance, plant turnarounds and capital projects. other revenue consists primarily of revenue from national accounts, which represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators. consequently, substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations.
recycling processing and commodity sales              273.2                    2.7                         297.8                 3.0

adoption of the new revenue recognition standard               -                  (4.0)
average yield is defined as revenue growth from the change in average price per unit of service, expressed as a percentage. core price is defined as price increases to our customers and fees, excluding fuel recovery, net of price decreases to retain customers. we also measure changes in average yield and core price as a percentage of related-business revenue, defined as total revenue excluding recycled commodities and fuel recovery fees, to determine the effectiveness of our pricing strategies. average yield as a percentage of related-business revenue was 2.9% and 2.5% 2019 and 2018, respectively. core price as a percentage of related-business revenue was 5.0% and 4.2% for 2019 and 2018, respectively.
•average yield increased revenue by 2.8% due to positive pricing in all lines of business.
•the fuel recovery fee program, which mitigates our exposure to increases in fuel prices, increased revenue due to an increase in the total revenue subject to the fuel recovery fees. this increase was entirely offset by a decrease in fuel prices during 2019, compared to the same period in 2018.
•volume decreased revenue by (0.4)% primarily due to declines in our residential and small-container collection lines of business. the volume declines in our collection lines of business were primarily due to certain non-regrettable losses during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. the volume decrease was partially offset by volume growth in our landfill and transfer station lines of business. the volume increase in our landfill line of business is primarily attributable to increased construction and demolition and solid waste volumes, which was partially offset by a decline in special waste volume.
•recycling processing and commodity sales decreased revenue by (0.3)% primarily due to a decline in recycled commodity prices as compared to the same period in 2018. the average price for recycled commodities, excluding glass and organics for 2019 was $77 per ton compared to $104 per ton for 2018. during 2019 and 2018, 2.2 million and 2.4 million tons, excluding glass and organics, respectively, were sold after being processed in our recycling processing centers.
changing market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices. at current volumes and mix of materials, we believe a $10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities would change annual revenue and operating income by approximately $13 million and $13 million, respectively.
•environmental services revenue decreased by (0.3)% primarily due to a decline in upstream exploration and production drilling activity and increased competition in the permian basin.
•acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased revenue by 0.8% due to our continued growth strategy of acquiring privately held solid waste, recycling and environmental services companies that complement our existing business platform.
cost of operations cost of operations includes labor and related benefits, which consists of salaries and wages, health and welfare benefits, incentive compensation and payroll taxes. it also includes transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations; maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles, equipment and containers, including related labor and benefit costs; transportation and subcontractor costs, which include costs for independent haulers that transport our waste to disposal facilities and costs for local operators who provide waste handling services associated with our national accounts in markets outside our standard operating areas; fuel, which includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles, net of fuel tax credits; disposal fees and taxes, consisting of landfill taxes, host community fees and royalties; landfill operating costs, which includes financial assurance, leachate disposal, remediation charges and other landfill maintenance costs; risk management costs, which include insurance premiums and claims; cost of goods sold, which includes material costs paid to suppliers; and other, which includes expenses such as facility operating costs, equipment rent and gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations.
labor and related benefits                      $2,202.4                  21.4   %                  $2,144.3               21.3   %
these cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies. as such, you should take care when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies.
•labor and related benefits increased in aggregate dollars due to higher hourly and salaried wages as a result of annual merit increases along with additional headcount attributable to acquisition-related growth.
•transfer and disposal costs increased in aggregate dollars primarily due to an increase in third party disposal rates and volumes disposed at third party facilities. during both the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately 68% of the total waste volume we collected was disposed at landfill sites that we own or operate (internalization).
•transportation and subcontract costs increased primarily due to increased third party transportation rates and acquisition related activity.
•fuel costs decreased due to a decline in both fuel prices and collection volumes as well as compressed natural gas (cng) tax credits that were enacted in december 2019, retroactively effective to january 2018, and recognized during the three months ended december 31, 2019. the national average cost per gallon for diesel fuel in 2019 was $3.06 compared to $3.18 for 2018.
•risk management expenses increased primarily due to an increase in premiums for our current year programs in part due to our acquisition-related activity.
•other costs of operations increased during 2019 primarily due to an increase in occupancy and facility costs. in addition, we recognized a gain on the sale of one of our operating facilities in 2018, which did not recur in 2019.
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased in aggregate dollars primarily due to additional assets acquired with our acquisitions, partially offset by the full depreciation of certain assets recognized in our 2008 acquisition of allied waste industries, inc.
landfill depletion and amortization increased due to higher landfill disposal volumes primarily driven by increased construction and demolition and solid waste volumes coupled with an overall increase in our average depletion rate per ton.
amortization of other intangible assets expenses for amortization of other intangible assets were $20.4 million and $56.4 million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, or 0.2% of revenue for 2019 and 0.6% for 2018. our other intangible assets primarily relate to customer relationships and, to a lesser extent, non-compete agreements. amortization expense decreased primarily due to the full amortization of certain intangible assets recognized in our 2008 acquisition of allied waste industries, inc, partially offset by additional assets acquired in 2019.
amortization of other assets expenses for amortization of other assets were $34.3 million, or 0.3% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2019, compared to $7.9 million, or 0.1% of revenue, for the same period in 2018. our other assets primarily relate to the prepayment of fees and capitalized implementation costs associated with cloud-based hosting arrangements. effective january 1, 2019, we adopted asu 2018-15, intangibles-goodwill and other-internal-use software (subtopic 350-40) no. 2018-15 customer's accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract (asu 2018-15) on a prospective basis. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we recognized $20.2 million of amortization related to the prepayment of fees as selling, general and administrative expenses. during 2019, we recognized $23.8 million of amortization related to the prepayment of similar fees in amortization of other assets.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, health and welfare benefits, and incentive compensation for corporate and field general management, field support functions, sales force, accounting and finance, legal, management information systems, and clerical and administrative departments. other expenses include rent and office costs, fees for professional services provided by third parties, legal settlements, marketing, investor and community relations services, directors' and officers' insurance, general employee relocation, travel, entertainment and bank charges. restructuring charges are excluded from selling, general and administrative expenses and are discussed separately.
acquisition integration and deal costs                           6.3               0.1                             -              -
these cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies. as such, you should take care when comparing our selling, general and administrative expenses by cost component to those of other companies.
the most significant items affecting our selling, general and administrative expenses during 2019 as compared to 2018 are summarized below:
•salaries increased primarily due to higher incentive pay and wages, benefits, and other payroll related items resulting from annual merit increases, excluding the $9.6 million of incremental costs we incurred attributable to the bridgeton landfill insurance recovery.
•during 2019, we recognized $6.3 million of acquisition integration and deal costs as selling, general, and administrative expenses.
gain on business divestitures and impairments, net we strive to have a number one or number two market position in each of the markets we serve, or have a clear path on how we will achieve a leading market position over time. where we cannot establish a leading market position, or where operations are not generating acceptable returns, we may decide to divest certain assets and reallocate resources to other markets. asset or business divestitures could result in gains, losses or asset impairment charges that may be material to our results of operations in a given period.
during 2019 and 2018, we recorded a net gain on business divestitures, net of asset impairments of $14.7 million and $44.9 million, respectively.
restructuring charges in january 2018, we eliminated certain positions following the consolidation of select back-office functions, including but not limited to the integration of our national accounts support functions into our existing corporate support functions. these changes include a reduction in administrative staffing and the closure of certain office locations. during 2019, we incurred restructuring charges of $14.2 million that primarily related to the redesign of our back-office software systems. during 2018, we incurred restructuring charges of $26.4 million, that primarily consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits and the closure of offices with non-cancelable terms. we paid $10.6 million and $24.7 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to these restructuring efforts.
interest expense the following table provides the components of interest expense, including accretion of debt discounts and accretion of discounts primarily associated with environmental and risk insurance liabilities assumed in acquisitions (in millions of dollars):
less: capitalized interest           (7.2)                   (6.8)
effective january 1, 2019, we adopted asu 2016-02, leases (topic 842) (asc 842 or the new leasing standard) using the optional transition method prescribed by asu 2018-11, leases (topic 842): targeted improvements. under the new leasing standard, we will present variable lease costs associated with our finance leases as a component of non-cash interest expense. variable lease costs are recognized in our consolidated statement of income in the period incurred. as such, we expect non-cash interest expense to fluctuate each period as the variable elements of these arrangements become known and the cost is incurred.
total interest expense for 2019 increased compared to 2018 primarily due to the increase in variable lease payments made in accordance with certain of our finance leases. during 2019 and 2018, cash paid for interest, excluding net swap settlements for our fixed to floating interest rate swaps, was $346.8 million and $351.0 million, respectively.
income taxes our provision for income taxes was $222.0 million and $283.3 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. our effective income tax rate was 17.1% and 21.5% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. we made income tax payments (net of refunds) of approximately $31 million and $210 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) for 2019 was favorably affected by 100% equipment deductions and tax credits related to our investment in solar energy assets.
during 2019, we acquired non-controlling interests in limited liability companies established to construct solar energy assets that qualified for investment tax credits under section 48 of the internal revenue code. we account for these investments using the equity method of accounting and recognize our share of income or loss and other reductions in the value of our investments in the loss from unconsolidated equity method investments within our consolidated statements of income. for further discussion regarding our equity method accounting, see note 3, business acquisitions, investments and restructuring charges, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k. our 2019 tax provision reflects a benefit of approximately $84 million due to the tax credits related to these investments. in addition, our 2019 tax provision was reduced by $13.4 million due to the realization of additional federal and state benefits as well as adjustments to deferred taxes due to the completion of our 2018 tax returns and also reduced by $12.3 million due to excess tax benefits related to stock compensation.
our 2018 tax provision was reduced by $12.1 million due to excess tax benefits, approximately $50 million related to the tax credits from our non-controlling interests in limited liability companies established to construct solar energy assets, and approximately $6 million due to the realization of tax credits and lower state rates due to changes in estimates following the completion of our 2017 tax returns.
we have deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards with an estimated tax effect of approximately $111 million available as of december 31, 2019. these state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various times between 2019 and 2039. we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from some of our state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized due to limitations on these loss carryforwards in certain states. in recognition of this risk, as of december 31, 2019, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $67 million.
as a result of the recent changes in u.s. tax law, as well as our ongoing efforts to streamline and maximize the efficiency of our tax footprint, we could further adjust our valuation allowance in a future period if there is sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that certain of the state net operating loss carryforwards, on which we currently provide a valuation allowance, would be realized.
reportable segments our senior management evaluates, oversees and manages the financial performance of our operations through two field groups, referred to as group 1 and group 2. group 1 primarily consists of geographic areas located in the western united states, and group 2 primarily consists of geographic areas located in the southeastern and mid-western united states, and the eastern seaboard of the united states.

corporate entities include legal, tax, treasury, information technology, risk management, human resources, closed landfills and other administrative functions. national accounts revenue included in corporate entities represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide and regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators. consequently, substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations.
•cost of operations favorably impacted operating income margin during 2019, primarily due to a decrease in labor and related benefits, maintenance and repairs expenses, and fuel costs as a result of cng tax credits that were enacted in december 2019 and retroactively effective to january 2018, offset by an increase in transportation and subcontract costs and landfill operating expenses.
revenue for 2019 increased 1.4% from 2018 primarily due to positive pricing in all lines of business and an increase in volume in our landfill line of business, which was partially offset by volume declines in our collection and transfer station lines of business.
•cost of operations favorably impacted operating income margin during 2019, primarily due to declines in our transfer and disposal costs and fuel costs as a result of cng tax credits that were enacted in december 2019 and retroactively effective to january 2018, partially offset by an increase in landfill operating expenses.
corporate entities operating loss in our corporate entities increased from $359.6 million for 2018 to $408.8 million for 2019. the operating loss for 2019 was unfavorably impacted by a lower gain on the disposition of assets in 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. additionally, we collected an insurance recovery of $24.0 million related to our closed bridgeton landfill during 2019, as compared to the insurance recovery $40.0 million recognized in the same period in 2018. these recoveries were offset by $9.6 million and $12.0 million, respectfully, of incremental costs attributable to the recoveries.
landfill and environmental matters our landfill costs include daily operating expenses, costs of capital for cell development, costs for final capping, closure and post-closure, and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance. daily operating expenses include leachate treatment, transportation and disposal costs, methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance costs, interim cap maintenance costs, and costs associated with applying daily cover materials. we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred. we use life cycle accounting and the units-of-consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development. in life cycle accounting, certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site, including excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems, installation of groundwater monitoring wells, and other costs associated with acquiring and developing the site. obligations associated with final capping, closure and post-closure are capitalized and amortized on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed.
cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers. our operating and accounting personnel use these estimates to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs. changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs, available airspace, inflation and applicable regulations. changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates, changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted. changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information.
available airspace as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 we owned or operated 189 and 190 active solid waste landfills, respectively, with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 5.0 billion and 5.1 billion in-place cubic yards, respectively. for these landfills, the following table reflects changes in capacity and remaining capacity, as measured in cubic yards of airspace:

total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace. engineers develop these estimates at least annually using information provided by annual aerial surveys. before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and, therefore, included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity, it must meet all of our expansion criteria. see note 2, summary of significant accounting policies, and note 8, landfill and environmental costs, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k for further information. also see our critical accounting judgments and estimates section of this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
as of december 31, 2019, 12 of our landfills met all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity. at projected annual volumes, these 12 landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 57 years, including probable expansion airspace. the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 62 years. we have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for treatment as probable expansion airspace.

final capping, closure and post-closure costs as of december 31, 2019, accrued final capping, closure and post-closure costs were $1,335.6 million, of which $75.8 million were current and $1,259.8 million were long-term as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
remediation and other charges for landfill matters it is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust our accrued landfill and environmental liabilities to reflect the effects of new or additional information, to the extent that such information impacts the costs, timing or duration of the required actions. future changes in our estimates of the costs, timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
for a description of our significant remediation matters, see note 8, landfill and environmental costs, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k.
investment in landfills as of december 31, 2019, we expect to spend an estimated additional $9.5 billion on existing landfills, primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures, over their remaining lives. our total expected investment, excluding non-depletable land, estimated to be $13.4 billion, or $2.68 per cubic yard, is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the units-of-consumption method.

total restricted cash and marketable securities          $179.4                  $108.1
intended uses of cash we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments, share repurchases and debt repayments. debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise. we believe that our excess cash, cash from operating activities and our availability to draw from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due.
we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings. we may also explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable. early extinguishment of debt will result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repaid. the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs.
summary of cash flow activity the major components of changes in cash flows for 2019 and 2018 are discussed in the following paragraphs. the following table summarizes our cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 (in millions of dollars):
net cash provided by operating activities       $2,352.1                    $2,242.8
net cash used in investing activities           $(1,719.0)                  $(1,229.1)
net cash used in financing activities           $(589.0)                    $(1,059.5)
cash flows provided by operating activities changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures, decreased our cash flow from operations by $227.6 million in 2019, compared to a decrease of $216.3 million in 2018, primarily as a result of the following:
•our accounts receivable, exclusive of the change in allowance for doubtful accounts and customer credits, increased $38.3 million during 2019 primarily due to growth in our revenue, compared to a $29.6 million increase in 2018. as of december 31, 2019, our days sales outstanding were 39.8, or 27.9 days net of deferred revenue, compared to 39.7, or 27.5 days net of deferred revenue, as of december 31, 2018.
•our prepaid expenses and other assets increased $109.7 million in 2019 compared to an increase of $152.5 million in 2018, primarily due to the timing of our estimated tax payments. cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) was approximately $31 million and $210 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) for 2019 was favorably affected by 100% equipment deductions, primarily attributable to capital expenditures and acquisition-related activity during the year, and tax credits related to our investments in solar energy assets. income taxes paid (net of refunds) in 2018 was favorably affected by the tax act and tax credits related to our investments in solar energy assets.
•cash paid for capping, closure and post-closure obligations was $6.3 million higher during 2019 compared to 2018. the increase in cash paid for capping, closure and post-closure obligations is primarily due to the timing of capping and post-closure payments at certain of our landfill sites.
in addition, cash paid for interest was $346.8 million and $351.0 million, excluding net swap settlements for our fixed to floating interest rate swaps, for 2019 and 2018, respectively.
we use cash flows from operations to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments, share repurchases and debt repayments.
cash flows used in investing activities the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in investing activities for 2019 and 2018 are summarized below:
•capital expenditures during 2019 were $1,207.1 million as compared to $1,071.8 million for 2018. during 2019, we entered into finance leases with future lease liabilities of $15.9 million, including finance leases acquired in business combination acquisitions.
•during 2019 and 2018, we used $575.1 million and $277.3 million, respectively, for acquisitions and investments, net of cash acquired. during 2019 and 2018, we received $42.8 million and $89.2 million for business divestitures, respectively.
we intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand, restricted cash held for capital expenditures, cash flows from operations, our revolving credit facilities, and tax-exempt bonds and other financings. we expect to primarily use cash for consideration paid for future business acquisitions.
cash flows used in financing activities the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in financing activities for 2019 and 2018 are summarized below:
•during 2019, we issued $900.0 million of senior notes for cash proceeds, net of discounts and fees of $891.1 million. during 2018, we issued $800.0 million of senior notes for cash proceeds, net of discounts and fees of $781.8 million. net payments of notes payable and long-term debt were $581.4 million during 2019, compared to net payments of $653.1 million in 2018. for a more detailed discussion, see the financial condition section of this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
•during 2019 and 2018, cash paid for purchase price holdback releases related to acquisitions was $17.2 million and $12.1 million, respectively.
financial condition debt obligations changes in our outstanding principal debt balances from december 31, 2018 to december 31, 2019 were primarily attributable to debt cash borrowings, net of principal debt payments, of $333.6 million and new finance leases, which increased our debt obligations by $15.9 million.
as of december 31, 2019, we had $930.7 million of principal debt maturing within the next 12 months, which includes certain senior notes, variable rate tax-exempt financings and finance lease obligations. all of our tax-exempt financings are remarketed quarterly by remarketing agents to effectively maintain a variable yield. the holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agents at the end of each interest period. to date, the remarketing agents have been able to remarket our variable rate unsecured tax-exempt bonds and we currently expect future remarketings to be successful. however, if the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds, the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. in the event of a failed remarketing, we currently have availability under our $2.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility to fund these bonds until they are remarketed successfully. accordingly, we have classified these borrowings as long-term in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2019.
for further discussion of the components of our overall debt, see note 9, debt, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k.
credit facilities in june 2018, we entered into a $2.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the credit facility), which replaced our $1.0 billion and $1.25 billion unsecured credit facilities that would have matured in may 2021 and june 2019, respectively (the replaced credit facilities). the credit facility matures in june 2023. we may request two one-year extensions of the maturity date but none of the lenders are committed to participate in such extension. the credit facility also includes a feature that allows us to increase availability, at our option, by an aggregate amount of up to $1.0 billion through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders. at our option, borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a base rate, or a eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings (all as defined in the credit facility agreement).
the credit facility requires us to comply with financial and other covenants. to the extent we are not in compliance with these covenants, we cannot pay dividends or repurchase common stock. compliance with covenants also is a condition for any incremental borrowings under our credit facility, and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans (which would adversely affect our liquidity). as of december 31, 2019, our ebitda to interest ratio was 7.54 compared to the 3.00 minimum required by the covenants, and our total debt to ebitda ratio was 2.99 compared to the 3.50 maximum allowed by the covenants. as of december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants under our credit facility, and we expect to be in compliance throughout 2020.
ebitda, which is a non-u.s. gaap measure, is calculated as defined in our credit facility agreement. in this context, ebitda is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to ebitda used by other companies or used by us for other purposes.
failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our credit facility, as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events, would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under our credit facility to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement. this could also have an adverse effect on the availability of financial assurances. in addition, maturity acceleration on our credit facility constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments, including our senior notes, and, therefore, our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity. if such acceleration were to occur, we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness. we would likely have to seek an amendment under our credit facility for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity, or asset sales, if necessary. we may be unable to amend our credit facility or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturity is accelerated.
availability under our credit facility totaled $1,696.9 million and $1,694.1 million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the credit facility can be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $184.4 million and $159.0 million of borrowings under our credit facility, respectively. we had $351.4 million and $379.6 million of letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
we also have an uncommitted credit facility, which bears interest at libor, plus an applicable margin. we can use borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility for working capital and other general corporate purposes. the agreements governing our uncommitted credit facility require us to comply with covenants. the uncommitted credit facility may be terminated by either party at any time. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $11.6 million and $33.4 million of borrowings under our uncommitted credit facility, respectively.
senior notes and debentures as of december 31, 2019, we had $7,257.0 million of unsecured senior notes and debentures outstanding with maturities ranging from 2020 to 2041. as of december 31, 2018, we had $6,998.8 million of unsecured senior notes and debentures outstanding with maturities ranging from 2019 to 2041. our senior notes are general senior unsecured obligations.
during 2019, we issued $900.0 million of 2.500% senior notes due 2024 (the 2.500% notes). we used the net proceeds from the 2.500% notes to repay $650.0 million of 5.500% senior notes that matured in september 2019. the remaining proceeds were used to repay amounts outstanding under our unsecured credit facilities as well as for general corporate purposes.
during 2018, we issued $800.0 million of 3.950% senior notes due 2028 (the 3.950% notes). we used the net proceeds from the 3.950% notes to repay $700.0 million of 3.800% senior notes that matured in may 2018, and the remaining proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our replaced credit facilities. in connection with this offering, we terminated interest rate lock agreements with a notional value of $600.0 million resulting in net proceeds of $31.1 million. the proceeds will amortize over the term of the 3.950% notes using the effective interest method. there was no ineffectiveness recognized in the termination of these cash flow hedges.
and 2018, we recognized $1.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively, as offsetting benefits to our interest expense from these swap agreements, which mature in may 2023.
as of december 31, 2019, our interest rate lock agreements had an aggregate notional value of $575.0 million with fixed interest rates ranging from 1.330% to 3.000%. as of december 31, 2018 our interest rate lock agreements had an aggregate notional value of $725.0 million with fixed interest rates ranging from 1.900% to 3.250%. we entered into these transactions to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in anticipation of planned future issuances of senior notes in 2019 through 2021. upon the expected issuance of the senior notes, we will terminate the interest rate locks and settle with our counterparties. the aggregate fair value of the outstanding interest rate locks as of december 31, 2019 were assets of $3.6 million, which were recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet, and liabilities of $15.7 million, which were recorded in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. the aggregate fair value of the outstanding interest rate locks as of december 31, 2018 was $10.3 million and was recorded in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheet.
see note 18, financial instruments, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k for further detail regarding the effect of our fair value and cash flow hedging on interest expense.
derivative contracts contemporaneously with the issuance of our 2.500% notes in august 2019, we amended interest rate lock agreements with a notional value of $375.0 million, extending the mandatory maturity date from 2019 to 2024 and dedesignated them as cash flow hedges (the extended interest rate swaps). there was no ineffectiveness recognized in the termination of these cash flow hedges. in addition, we entered into an offsetting interest rate swap to offset future exposures to fair value fluctuations of the extended interest rate swaps (the offsetting interest rate swaps). the fair value of these free standing derivatives was determined using standard valuation models with assumptions about interest rates being based on those observed in underlying markets (level 2 in the fair value hierarchy).
as of december 31, 2019, the fair value of the extended interest rate swaps was a liability of $22.2 million which was included in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet, and the fair value of the offsetting interest rate swaps was an asset of $2.9 million and was included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet. for the year ended december 31, 2019, we recognized a loss of $3.4 million on the change in fair value of the extended interest rate swaps, with an offsetting gain of $2.9 million on the offsetting interest rate swaps. the change in fair value was recorded directly in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income.
tax-exempt financings as of december 31, 2019, we had $1,116.2 million of certain fixed and variable rate tax-exempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from 2020 to 2049. as of december 31, 2018, we had $1,036.8 million of certain fixed and variable rate tax-exempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from 2019 to 2044.
during the year ended december 31, 2019, we refinanced $35.0 million of tax-exempt financings and issued $30.0 million of new tax-exempt financings. in addition, during the three months ended december 31, 2019, we issued $50.0 million of variable-rate tax-exempt debt. the proceeds from the issuance were used to fund qualifying landfill-related capital expenditures in the state of california.
finance leases we had finance lease liabilities of $119.3 million and $109.5 million as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with maturities ranging from 2020 to 2049 and 2019 to 2046, respectively.
year ending                     operating                       maturities of                   scheduled interest payment obligations                final capping,                   remediation                    unconditional             total december 31,                        leases                      notes payable,                                                                            closure and                                                       purchase finance leases                                                                           post-closure                                                    commitments and other long-
the estimated remaining final capping, closure and post-closure and remediation expenditures presented above are not inflated or discounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of december 31, 2019 and for liabilities yet to be incurred over the remaining life of our landfills.
unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of (1) disposal related agreements that include fixed or minimum royalty payments, host agreements and take-or-pay and put-or-pay agreements and (2) other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements.
financial assurance we must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping, closure and post-closure costs, and related to our performance under certain collection, landfill and transfer station contracts. we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds, letters of credit, or insurance policies (financial assurance instruments), or trust deposits, which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and post-closure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations. the financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and post-closure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill. generally, states require a third-party engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping, closure and post-closure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill. the amount of financial assurance required can, and generally will, differ from the obligation determined and recorded under u.s. gaap. the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract. additionally, we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations. we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during 2020, although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change.
these financial assurance instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not classified as indebtedness. because we currently have no liability for the financial assurance instruments, they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets; however, we record capping, closure and post-closure liabilities and insurance liabilities as they are incurred.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations, other than short-term operating leases and financial assurances, which are not classified as debt. we have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed, consolidated into or reflected in our reported financial position or results of operations. we have not guaranteed any third-party debt.
contingencies for a description of our commitments and contingencies, see note 8, landfill and environmental costs, note 11, income taxes, and note 19, commitments and contingencies, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k.
critical accounting judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management. the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. such critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments.
we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas. residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast.
our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories, each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates:
•landfill development costs that are capitalized as an asset.
•landfill retirement obligations relating to our capping, closure and post-closure liabilities that result in a corresponding landfill retirement asset.
we use life-cycle accounting and the units-of-consumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site. in life-cycle accounting, all current and future capitalized costs to acquire and construct a site are calculated, and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. obligations associated with final capping, closure and post-closure are also capitalized, and amortized on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed. cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers.
landfill development costs site permits.  to develop, construct and operate a landfill, we must obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local, state and federal levels. the permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations. the initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval. during the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but before the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted.
•changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes to the landfill site permitting process. these changes could make it more difficult and costly to obtain and maintain a landfill permit.
•studies performed could be inaccurate, which could result in the denial or revocation of a permit and changes to accounting assumptions. conditions could exist that were not identified in the study, which may make the location not feasible for a landfill and could result in the denial of a permit. denial or revocation of a permit could impair the recorded value of the landfill asset.
•actions by neighboring parties, private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain, maintain or expand permits could result in denial, revocation or suspension of a permit, which could adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill and could impair the recorded value of the landfill. as a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit, improved technical information as a project progresses, or changes in the anticipated economics associated with a project, we may decide to reduce the scope of, or abandon, a project, which could result in an asset impairment.
technical landfill design.  upon receipt of initial regulatory approval, technical landfill designs are prepared. the technical designs, which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required, are reviewed by our environmental management group. the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval. upon approval of the technical designs, the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill.
•changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require changes in the landfill technical designs. these changes could make it more difficult and costly to meet new design standards.
•technical designs could be inaccurate and could result in increased construction costs, difficulty in obtaining a permit or the use of rates to recognize the amortization of landfill development costs and asset retirement obligations that are not appropriate.
permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity.  included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill. these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed, such as the depth of excavation, the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the side-slope construction. the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards. this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a site-specific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill.
•estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements.
•the density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions, including waste compaction practices, site design, climate and the nature of the waste.
•capacity is defined in cubic yards but waste received is measured in tons. the number of tons per cubic yard varies by type of waste and our rate of compaction.
development costs.  the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes, installation of groundwater monitoring wells, construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site. we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with third-party bids or contractual arrangements, reviewing the changes in year-over-year cost estimates for reasonableness, and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs. these development costs, together with any costs incurred to acquire, design and permit the landfill, including capitalized interest, are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred.
•actual future costs of construction materials and third-party labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the level of demand and the availability of the required materials and labor. technical designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions, regulatory changes or legislative changes.
landfill development asset amortization.  to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations, we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a per-ton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill. the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill's operating life. the per-ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs (as described above) for the landfill, by the landfill's estimated remaining disposal capacity. the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted, but rather expressed in nominal dollars. this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period.
amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill, including acquisition costs, which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values. we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value. amortization rates are also influenced by site-specific engineering and cost factors.
•changes in our future development cost estimates or our disposal capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization rates and will impact amortization expense prospectively. an unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction in disposal capacity could affect the ongoing economic viability of the landfill and result in asset impairment.
on at least an annual basis, we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill. these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually. changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually. see our results of operations section in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion on changes to our landfill depletion and amortization.
obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event. obligations related to closure and post-closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill. landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units-of-consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill, depending on the nature of the obligation. all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value. fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our credit-adjusted, risk-free rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred. future costs for final capping, closure and post-closure are developed at least annually by engineers, and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections.
landfill capping.  as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity, we must cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit. these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill site process previously described.
closure and post-closure.  closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill stops receiving waste, but prior to being certified as closed. after the entire landfill has reached capacity and is certified closed, we must continue to maintain and monitor the site for a post-closure period, which generally extends for 30 years. costs associated with closure and post-closure requirements generally include maintenance of the site, the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems, and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste. costs associated with post-closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling, analysis and statistical reports, third-party labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance, transportation and disposal of leachate, and erosion control costs related to the final cap.
landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets.  estimates of the total future costs required to cap, close and monitor each landfill as specified by the landfill permit are updated annually. the estimates include inflation, the specific timing of future cash outflows, and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events. our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation, which is updated annually and is based upon the ten year average consumer price index (1.7% in 2019 and 2018).
the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and post-closure costs for each landfill are recorded as incurred on a per-ton basis. these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill.
capping, closure and post-closure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our credit-adjusted risk-free rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred (4.3% in 2019 and 2018).
retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average credit-adjusted risk-free rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities. this accretion is charged to operating expenses. actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made.
corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping, closure and post-closure liabilities. the retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a per-ton basis as disposal capacity is consumed. the per-ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset's net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity. a per-ton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event. closure and post-closure per-ton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill.
•changes in legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in capping, closure activities or post-closure monitoring activities, types and quantities of materials used, or term of post-closure care, could cause changes in our cost estimates.
•changes in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in the anticipated waste flow, changes in airspace compaction estimates or changes in the timing of expenditures for closed landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are recorded in results of operations prospectively. this could result in unanticipated increases or decreases in expense.
•actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing, causing differences in timing of when amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping, closure and post-closure liabilities.
•changes in inflation rates could impact our actual future costs and our total liabilities.
•changes in our capital structure or market conditions could result in changes to the credit-adjusted risk-free rate used to discount the liabilities, which could cause changes in future recorded liabilities, assets and expense.
•amortization rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill capping design, post-closure monitoring requirements, or the inflation or discount rate.
on an annual basis, we update our estimates of future capping, closure and post-closure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill. revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping, closure and post-closure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets. changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively, except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills, where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed. see our results of operations section in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion on changes to our landfill depletion and amortization.
permitted and probable disposal capacity.  disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit. we classify this disposal capacity as permitted. we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates, thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion. probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies, but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and that the successful completion of the expansion is probable. we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace. we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted. however, because some of these criteria are judgmental, they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted. in either of these scenarios, our amortization, depletion and accretion expense could change significantly. our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion airspace are as follows:
•we own the land associated with the expansion airspace or control it pursuant to an option agreement;
•we are committed to supporting the expansion project financially and with appropriate resources;
•there are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated with the project, including political impediments;
•the expansion is attainable within a reasonable time frame; and
•we believe it is likely we will receive the expansion permit.
after successfully meeting these criteria, the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates. additionally, for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping, closure and post-closure rates, we include the incremental costs to develop, construct, close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity.
•we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the final local, state or federal permits or due to other unknown reasons. if we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity, or the disposal capacity for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated, both our estimated total costs and disposal capacity will be reduced, which generally increases the rates we charge for landfill amortization and capping, closure and post-closure accruals. an unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could also cause an asset impairment.
environmental liabilities we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business. under current laws and regulations, we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate, including sites that we have acquired, or sites where we have (or a company that we have acquired has) delivered waste. our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater, surface water and soil contamination, as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs. to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites, we evaluate several factors, including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site, the required remediation methods, timing of expenditures, the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties. we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies. we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary. changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known. adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts. with the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of allied, environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis. environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of allied, which were initially estimated on a discounted basis, are accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense. adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases or decreases in these obligations and are calculated on a discounted basis as they were initially estimated on a discounted basis. these adjustments are charged to operating income when they are known. we perform a comprehensive review of our environmental obligations annually and also review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. see our results of operations section in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion on our remediation adjustments. we have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies.
•we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of our environmental remediation liabilities. our estimates of these liabilities require assumptions about uncertain future events. thus, our estimates could change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of contamination, the required remediation methods, timing of expenditures, the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties identified, the financial viability of those parties, and the actions of governmental agencies or private parties with interests in the matter. the actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs, and any adjustments could be material.
•actual amounts could differ from the estimated liabilities as a result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue the matter to ultimate resolution.
•an unanticipated environmental liability that arises could result in a material charge to our consolidated statements of income.
insurance reserves and related costs our insurance policies for workers' compensation, commercial general liability, commercial auto liability and environmental liability are high deductible, or retention programs. the deductibles, or retentions, range from $3 million to $10 million. the employee-related health benefits are also subject to a high deductible insurance policy. accruals for deductibles or retentions are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported.
•incident rates, including frequency and severity, and other actuarial assumptions could change causing our current and future actuarially determined obligations to change, which would be reflected in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which such adjustment is known.

item 7: management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general w.w. grainger, inc. (grainger or company) is a broad line, business-to-business distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (mro) products and services with operations primarily in north america, japan and europe. more than 3.5 million customers worldwide rely on grainger for products such as safety, gloves, ladders, motors and janitorial supplies, along with services such as inventory management and technical support. these customers represent a broad collection of industries (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements (financial statements)). they place orders through digital channels, over the phone and at local branches. approximately 5,000 suppliers provide grainger with about 1.6 million products stocked in grainger's distribution centers (dcs) and branches worldwide.
grainger's two reportable segments are the u.s. and canada (acklands - grainger, inc. and its subsidiaries). these reportable segments reflect the results of the company's high-touch solutions businesses in those geographies. other businesses include the endless assortment businesses, (zoro in the u.s. and monotaro in japan), and smaller international high-touch solutions businesses in europe and mexico.
outlook the company's strategic priority for 2020 is clear: relentlessly expand grainger's leadership position in the mro space by being the go-to-partner for people who build and run safe, sustainable and productive operations. to achieve this, each grainger business has a set of strategic objectives focused on top line growth through market share gain. the u.s. business is focused on growing through differentiated sales and services (e.g., direct customer relationships and onsite services), advantaged mro solutions (e.g., get customers the exact products and services they need to solve a problem quickly) and unparalleled customer service (e.g., deliver flawlessly on every customer transaction). the canada business is focused on growing volume and gaining market share after substantially completing a multi-year turnaround. the other businesses are primarily focused on profitably growing the international high-touch businesses in europe and mexico and the endless assortment businesses through product assortment expansion and innovative customer acquisition. additionally, all grainger businesses are focused on continuously improving cost structures, investing in digital marketing, technology and supply chain infrastructure to ultimately deliver long-term returns for shareholders.
gross profit                                           4,397                 4,348                          1                %                     38.3       %            38.7       %
grainger's net sales of $11,486 million for the year ended 2019 increased $265 million, or 2.5%, compared to the same period in 2018. the increase in net sales was primarily driven by volume increases in the u.s. business from market share gain and continued double-digit growth in the endless assortments businesses, partially offset by lower sales in the canada business and other businesses. see note 14 to the financial statements and refer to the segment analysis below for further details.
gross profit of $4,397 million for the year ended 2019 increased $49 million, or 1% compared with the same period in 2018. the gross profit margin of 38.3% decreased 0.5 percentage points when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily driven by the lower margin endless assortment businesses which are growing at a faster rate than the rest of the company. elsewhere, lower gross profit margins in the u.s. were offset by supply chain favorability in canada.
the tables below reconcile reported selling, general and administrative expenses (sg&a), operating earnings, net earnings attributable to w.w. grainger, inc. and diluted earnings per share, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) in the united states of america to adjusted sg&a, operating earnings, net earnings attributable to w.w. grainger, inc. and diluted earnings per share, which are all considered non-gaap measures. the company believes that these non-gaap measures provide meaningful information to assist shareholders in understanding financial results and assessing prospects for future performance as they provide a better baseline for analyzing the ongoing performance of its businesses by excluding items that may not be indicative of core operating results. because non-gaap financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these measures with other companies' non-gaap measures having the same or similar names. these non-gaap measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported results. these non-gaap measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of operations that, when viewed with gaap results, provide a more complete understanding of the business. all tables below are in millions of dollars:
(1) the tax impact of adjustments and non-cash impairments are calculated based on the income tax rate in each applicable jurisdiction, subject to deductibility and the company's ability to realize the associated tax benefits.
income taxes of $314 million for the year ended 2019 increased $56 million, or 22% compared to $258 million for the same period in 2018. grainger's effective tax rates were 26.0% and 23.9% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. the increase was primarily driven by lower tax benefit from stock-based compensation and the absence of the company's clean energy tax benefits in 2019 as the company concluded its investments in 2018.

the following comments at the reportable segment and other business unit level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. see note 14 to the financial statements.
united states net sales were $8,815 million for the year ended 2019, an increase of $227 million, or 2.5% compared with net sales of $8,588 million for 2018 and consisted of the following:
gross profit margin decreased 0.4 percentage points compared to the same period in 2018 reflecting the impact of contract renegotiations and customer mix.
operating earnings of $1,391 million increased $53 million, or 4% from $1,338 million in the same period of 2018. this increase was driven primarily by higher sales, higher gross profit dollars and improved sg&a leverage.
canada net sales were $529 million for the year ended 2019, a decrease of $124 million, or 19% when compared with $653 million for 2018 and consisted of the following:
gross profit margin increased 0.7 percentage points in 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to inventory and supply chain efficiencies.
the net sales increase was primarily due to customer acquisition growth from the endless assortment businesses, partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds from the euro and pound sterling.

financial condition for the full year 2017 discussion, see item 7: management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - financial condition in grainger's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018.
grainger believes that its current level of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under its revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs. grainger expects to continue to invest in its business and return excess cash to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, which it plans to fund through total available liquidity and cash flows generated from operations. grainger also maintains access to capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity.
cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2019 and 2018, grainger had cash and cash equivalents of $360 million and $538 million, respectively. approximately 69% and 49% were outside the u.s. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. grainger has no material limits or restrictions on its ability to use these foreign liquid assets.
net cash provided by operating activities was $1,042 million and $1,057 million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily related to employee variable compensation payments, partially offset by favorable net income and changes in working capital.
net cash used in investing activities was $202 million and $166 million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. this increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by lower proceeds from the sales of assets when compared to the prior year.
net cash used in financing activities was $1,023 million and $670 million in the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by higher treasury stock repurchases in 2019 compared to 2018 and lower proceeds from stock options exercised.
working capital internally generated funds are the primary source of working capital and growth initiatives including capital expenditures. grainger's working capital is not impacted by significant seasonality trends throughout the year.
working capital consists of current assets (less non-operating cash) and current liabilities (less short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt and lease liabilities). working capital was $2,092 million at december 31, 2019, compared with $1,898 million at december 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and inventory and decreases in accrued compensation and benefits partially offset by increases in accounts payable. at these dates, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.6 and 2.4, respectively.
capital expenditures in each of the past two years, a portion of the company's net cash flows has been used for additions to property, buildings, equipment and capitalized software (presented in intangibles - net on the consolidated balance sheet) as summarized in the following table (in millions of dollars):
furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment           131                         137
capitalized software                                    43                          33
in 2019, the company continued to invest in its north american and japanese distribution networks (e.g. new dcs and branches as well as machinery and equipment to further automate the distribution process). in addition, the company invested in the development of inventory management and software solutions.
in 2018, the company continued to invest in its north american distribution network (e.g. new or expanding existing facilities and technology). other investments include the consolidation of facility and office locations and development of software solutions.
projected spending for 2020 is expected to be approximately $250 million which includes continued investments in its supply chain, software development, office space maintenance and inventory management solutions. grainger expects to fund 2020 capital spending primarily from operating cash flows.
debt grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. in addition to internally generated funds, grainger has various sources of financing available, including bank borrowings under lines of credit. total debt, which is defined as total interest-bearing debt (short-term current and long-term) and lease liabilities as a percent of total capitalization, was 54.3% and 51.5%, as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
grainger receives ratings from two independent credit ratings agencies: moody's investor service (moody's) and standard & poor's (s&p). both credit rating agencies currently rate our corporate credit at investment grade. the following table summarizes the company's credit ratings at december 31, 2019:
commitments and other contractual obligations at december 31, 2019 grainger's contractual obligations, including estimated payments due by period, are as follows (in millions of dollars):
payments due by period total amounts committed            less than 1 year           1 - 3 years           3 - 5 years       more than 5 years debt obligations                                                       $2,181                          $246                    $129                    $6             $1,800

other liabilities                                                         103                            81                       5                     4                        13
purchase obligations are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs. while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and non-inventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract.
other liabilities represent future payments for profit sharing and other employee benefit plans.
the company's net obligation for postretirement healthcare benefits plan of approximately $2 million, is not included in the table above as no additional amounts are required to be funded as of december 31, 2019. the company's historical practice regarding this plan has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate.
grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of approximately $32 million for tax uncertainties and interest at december 31, 2019. this amount is excluded from the table above, as grainger cannot predict the timing of these cash payments by period. see note 13 to the financial statements.
critical accounting estimates the methods, assumptions, and estimates that used in applying the company's accounting policies may require the application of judgments regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. the company considers an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) it involves assumptions that are uncertain when judgment was applied, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a significant impact on grainger's consolidated financial position and results. while the company believes that estimates, assumptions, and judgments used are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate was made. see note 1 to the financial statements for further information on the company's critical accounting estimates, which are as follows:

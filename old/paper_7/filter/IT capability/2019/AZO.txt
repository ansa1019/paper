item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are the leading retailer, and a leading distributor, of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the americas. we began operations in 1979 and at august 31, 2019, operated 5,772 stores in the u.s., including puerto rico and saint thomas; 604 stores in mexico; and 35 stores in brazil. each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products. at august 31, 2019, in 4,893 of our domestic stores, we also had a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, service stations and public sector accounts. we also have commercial programs in stores in mexico and brazil. we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through www.alldata.com and www.alldatadiy.com. additionally, we sell automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products through www.autozone.com, and our commercial customers can make purchases through www.autozonepro.com. we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services.
executive summary for fiscal 2019, we achieved record net income of $1.617 billion, a 20.9% increase over the prior year, and sales growth of $642.7 million, a 5.7% increase over the prior year. both our retail sales and commercial sales grew this past year, as we continue to make progress on our initiatives that are aimed at improving our ability to say yes to our customers more frequently, drive traffic to our stores and accelerate our commercial growth.
our business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumer and our industry, including but not limited to fuel costs, wage rates and other economic conditions. given the nature of these macroeconomic factors, we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue, nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future.
one macroeconomic factor affecting our customers and our industry during fiscal 2019 was gas prices. during fiscal 2019, the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the u.s. was $2.63 per gallon, compared to $2.67 per gallon during fiscal 2018. we believe fluctuations in gas prices impact our customers level of disposable income. with approximately 12 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumption each month across the u.s., each $1 decrease at the pump contributes approximately $12 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month. given the unpredictability of gas prices, we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease, nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods.
we have also experienced accelerated pressure on wages in the u.s. during fiscal 2019. some of this is attributed to regulatory changes in certain states and municipalities, while the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures with lower unemployment rates and some specific actions taken in recent years by other retailers. the regulatory changes are going to continue, as evidenced by the areas that have passed legislation to increase their wages substantially over the next few years, but we are still assessing to what degree these changes will impact our earnings growth in future periods.
during fiscal 2019, failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix, at approximately 85% of total sales, with failure related categories continuing to comprise our largest set of categories. while we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years, in our domestic stores we did experience a slight increase in mix of sales of the failure category as compared to last year. we believe the improvement in this sales category was driven by differences in regional weather patterns and improved merchandise assortments due to the products we have added over the last year. our sales mix can be impacted by severe or unusual weather over a short term period. over the long term, we believe the impact of the weather on our sales mix is not significant.
miles driven we believe that as the number of miles driven increases, consumers vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance, resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items. while over the long-term we have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven, we have also seen certain time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven. during the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven, we believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors, including the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road. since the beginning of the fiscal year and through july 2019 (latest publicly available information), miles driven in the u.s. increased by 0.8% compared to the same period in the prior year.
results of operations fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018
for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019, we reported net sales of $11.864 billion compared with $11.221 billion for the year ended august 25, 2018, a 5.7% increase from fiscal 2018. this growth was driven primarily by net sales of $410.5 million from new domestic stores, the additional 53rd week sales of $238.6 million and a domestic same store sales increase of 3.0% partially offset by the impact of the sale of two businesses in the prior year. same store sales are computed on a 52-week basis. domestic commercial sales increased $348.6 million, or 15.7%, over domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2018 which benefited $51.3 million from the additional week of sales.
at august 31, 2019, we operated 5,772 domestic stores, 604 in mexico and 35 in brazil, compared with 5,618 domestic stores, 564 in mexico and 20 in brazil at august 25, 2018. we reported a total auto parts segment (domestic, mexico, brazil and imc through april 4, 2018) sales increase of 6.3% for fiscal 2019.
gross profit for fiscal 2019 was $6.365 billion, or 53.7% of net sales, a 41 basis point increase compared with $5.974 billion, or 53.2% of net sales for fiscal 2018. the increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of the sale of two businesses completed in the prior year (+37 basis points).
interest expense, net for fiscal 2019 was $184.8 million compared with $174.5 million during fiscal 2018. this increase was primarily due to higher debt levels and an additional week of interest incurred due to the 53rd week. average borrowings for fiscal 2019 were $5.097 billion, compared with $4.997 billion for fiscal 2018, and weighted average borrowing rates were 3.2% for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018.
fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017
a discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 has been omitted from this form 10-k, but may be found in item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our form 10-k for the fiscal year ended august 25, 2018, filed with the sec on october 24, 2018, which is available free of charge on the secs website at www.sec.gov and at www.autozone.com, by clicking investor relations located at the bottom of the page.
quarterly periods each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks, and the fourth quarter consisted of 17 weeks in 2019 and 16 weeks in 2018 and 2017. because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks, compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters, our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income. the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 represented 33.6% of annual sales and 35.0% of net income; and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 represented 31.7% of annual sales and 29.9% of net income; and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 represented 32.3% of annual sales and 33.9% of net income.
income taxes on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted tax reform into law. tax reform significantly revises the u.s. federal corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory federal corporate rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to u.s. federal tax. also in december 2017, the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no. 118 (sab 118) to address the application of gaap in situations when the registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared and analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of tax reform.
during the year ended august 25, 2018, we recorded provisional tax benefit of $131.5 million related to tax reform, comprised of a $157.3 million remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset (dta), offset by $25.8 million of transition tax. during the year ended august 31, 2019, the company completed its analysis of tax reform and recorded adjustments to the previously-recorded provisional amounts, resulting in an $8.8 million tax benefit, primarily related to transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
beginning with the year ending august 31, 2019, we are subject to a new tax on global intangible low-taxed income (gilti) that is imposed on foreign earnings. we have made the election to record this tax as a period cost, thus we have not adjusted the deferred tax assets or liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries for the new tax. net impacts for gilti were immaterial and are included in the provision for income taxes for the year ending august 31, 2019.
liquidity and capital resources the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts, products and accessories. net cash provided by operating activities was $2.129 billion in 2019, $2.080 billion in 2018 and $1.571 in 2017. cash flows from operations are favorable compared to last year primarily due to the timing of payment of accounts payable and growth in net income partially due to the additional week of sales in the current year.
our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued new-location development program and the building of new distribution centers. net cash flows used in investing activities were $491.8 million in fiscal 2019, compared to $521.9 million in fiscal 2018 and $553.6 million in fiscal 2017. we invested $496.1 million in capital assets in fiscal 2019, compared to $521.8 million in fiscal 2018 and $553.8 million in fiscal 2017. we had new location openings of 209 for fiscal 2019, 201 for fiscal 2018 and 215 for fiscal 2017. the decrease in capital expenditures from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 was attributable to one distribution center opening in fiscal 2018 and none constructed in fiscal 2019. we opened two distribution centers in fiscal 2017. we invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable debt securities. we purchased $55.5 million in marketable debt securities in fiscal 2019, $104.5 million in fiscal 2018 and $85.7 million in fiscal 2017. we had proceeds from the sale of marketable debt securities of $53.1 million in fiscal 2019, $69.6 million in fiscal 2018 and $83.0 million in fiscal 2017.
net cash used in financing activities was $1.674 billion in 2019, $1.632 billion in 2018 and $914.3 million in 2017. the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled $2.005 billion for fiscal 2019, $1.592 billion for fiscal 2018 and $1.072 billion for fiscal 2017. the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 were primarily funded by cash flows from operations. the company issued $750 million of new debt in fiscal 2019 compared to none in fiscal 2018 and $600 million for fiscal 2017. in fiscal 2019 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings and our $250 million senior notes due in april 2019 and for other general corporate purposes. in fiscal 2018, we used commercial paper borrowings to repay our $250 million senior notes due in august 2018. in fiscal 2017, the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings, which were used to repay the $400 million senior notes due in january 2017.
during fiscal 2020, we expect to increase the investment in our business as compared to fiscal 2019. our investments are expected to be directed primarily to new locations, supply chain infrastructure, enhancements to existing locations and investments in technology. the amount of investments in our new locations is impacted by different factors, including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased (requiring higher investment) or leased (generally lower investment), located in the united states, mexico or brazil, or located in urban or rural areas. during fiscal 2019 and 2018, our capital expenditures decreased by approximately 5% and 6%, respectively, compared to the prior year period. in fiscal 2017, our capital expenditures increased by approximately 13% as compared to the prior year.
in addition to the building and land costs, our new locations require working capital, predominantly for inventories. historically, we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers, reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio. we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases; however, our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors capacity to factor their receivables from us. certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their receivables from us, allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate. in recent years, we initiated a variety of strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability, which increased our inventory per location. many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortments by providing extended payment terms. these extended payment terms have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio. we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 112.6% at august 31, 2019 and 111.8% at august 25, 2018. the increase from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to more favorable vendor terms.
depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments (either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions), we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures, working capital requirements and stock repurchases. the balance may be funded through new borrowings. we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past.
our cash balances are held in various locations around the world. as of august 31, 2019, and august 25, 2018, cash and cash equivalents of $49.9 million and $98.8 million, respectively, were held outside of the u.s. and were generally utilized to support the liquidity needs in our foreign operations.
for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019, our after-tax return on invested capital (roic) was 35.7% as compared to 32.1% for the comparable prior year period. roic is calculated as after-tax operating profit (excluding rent charges) divided by invested capital (which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases). for fiscal 2019, after-tax operating profit was adjusted for the tax reforms impact on the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities, net of the repatriation tax. for fiscal 2018, after-tax operating profit was adjusted for impairment charges, pension termination charges and tax reforms impact on the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities, net of the repatriation tax. the increase in roic in fiscal 2019 is primarily due to the increase in net income due to the additional week of operations. we use roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance. refer to the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures section for further details of our calculation.
debt facilities we entered into a master extension, new commitment and amendment agreement dated as of november 18, 2017 (the extension amendment) to the third amended and restated credit agreement dated as of november 18, 2016, as amended, modified, extended or restated from time to time (the revolving credit agreement). under the extension amendment: (i) our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement was increased from $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion; (ii) our option to increase the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement was refreshed and the amount of such option remained at $400 million; (iii) the maximum borrowing under the revolving credit agreement may, at our option, subject to lenders approval, be increased from $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion; (iv) the termination date of the revolving credit agreement was extended from november 18, 2021 until november 18, 2022; and (v) we have the option to make one additional written request of the lenders to extend the termination date then in effect for an additional year. under the revolving credit agreement, we may borrow funds consisting of eurodollar loans, base rate loans or a combination of both.
interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate, defined as libor plus the applicable percentage, as defined in the revolving credit agreement, depending upon our senior, unsecured, (non-credit enhanced) long-term debt ratings. interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the revolving credit agreement. as of august 31, 2019, we had $3.3 million of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit agreement.
the revolving credit agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 2.5:1. this ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) consolidated earnings before interest, taxes and rents to (ii) consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents. our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august 31, 2019 was 5.7:1.
as of august 31, 2019, our $1.030 billion of commercial paper borrowings were classified as long-term in the consolidated balance sheets as we have the ability and intent to refinance them on a long-term basis through available capacity in our revolving credit facilities. as of august 31, 2019, we had $1.997 billion of availability under our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, which would allow us to replace these short-term obligations with long-term financing facilities.
we also maintain a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of $25 million. the letter of credit facility is in addition to the letters of credit that may be issued under the revolving credit agreement. in fiscal 2019, we amended our existing letter of credit facility to decrease the amount that can be requested in letters of credit from $75 million to $25 million effective june 2019. this amendment also extended the maturity date from june 2019 to june 2022. as of august 31, 2019, we had $25.0 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility.
in addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facilities discussed above, we had $72.9 million in letters of credit outstanding as of august 31, 2019. these letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis.
on april 18, 2019, we issued $300 million in 3.125% senior notes due april 2024 and $450 million in 3.750% senior notes due april 2029 under our automatic shelf registration statement on form s-3, filed with the sec on april 4, 2019 (file no. 333-230719) (the 2019 shelf registration). proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings, the $250 million in 1.625% senior notes due in april 2019 and for other general corporate purposes.
on april 18, 2017, we issued $600 million in 3.750% senior notes due june 2027 under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on april 15, 2015 (the 2015 shelf registration). proceeds from the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes.
the senior notes contain a provision that repayment of the senior notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control (as defined in the agreements). our borrowings under our senior notes contain minimal covenants, primarily restrictions on liens, sale and leaseback transactions and consolidations, mergers and the sale of assets. under our revolving credit facility, covenants include restrictions on liens, a maximum debt to earnings ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances. all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the applicable scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs.
as of august 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants under our borrowing arrangements.
for the fiscal years ended august 31, 2019 and august 26, 2018, our adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share-based compensation expense (ebitdar) ratio was 2.5:1. we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt, capital lease obligations and rent times six; and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share-based compensation expense to net income. for fiscal 2018, net income was adjusted to exclude impairment charges and pension termination charges before tax impact as these charges are not reflective of ongoing operations. we target our debt levels to a specified ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings and believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels.
to the extent ebitdar continues to grow in future years, we expect our debt levels to increase; conversely, if ebitdar declines, we would expect our debt levels to decrease. refer to the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures section for further details of our calculation.
stock repurchases during 1998, we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors (the board). on september 26, 2018, the board voted to increase the authorization by $1.25 billion. on march 20, 2019, the board voted to increase the authorization by $1.0 billion. this raised the total value of shares authorized to be repurchased to $21.9 billion. from january 1998 to august 31, 2019, we have repurchased a total of 146.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of $21.423 billion. we repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $2.005 billion during fiscal 2019, 2.4 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.592 billion during fiscal 2018 and 1.5 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.072 billion during fiscal 2017. considering cumulative repurchases as of august 31, 2019, we had $476.8 million remaining under the boards authorization to repurchase our common stock.
for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2019, cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt was $1.759 billion as compared to $1.596 billion during the comparable prior year period. cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt is calculated as the net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents less net increases or decreases in debt plus share repurchases. we use cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt to calculate the cash flows remaining and available in an effort to increase shareholder value in the form of share repurchases. we believe this is important information regarding our allocation of available capital where we prioritize investments in the business and utilize the remaining funds to repurchase shares, while maintaining debt levels that support our investment grade credit ratings. if we allowed these funds to accumulate on our balance sheet instead of repurchasing our shares, we believe our earnings per share and stock price would be negatively impacted. refer to the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures section for further details of our calculation.
on october 7, 2019, the board voted to authorize the repurchase of an additional $1.25 billion of our common stock in connection with our ongoing share repurchase program. since the inception of the repurchase program in 1998, the board has authorized $23.2 billion in share repurchases. subsequent to august 31, 2019, we have repurchased 259,384 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $284.6 million. considering the cumulative repurchases and the increase in authorization subsequent to august 31, 2019, we have $1.44 billion remaining under the boards authorization to repurchase its common stock.
financial commitments the following table shows our significant contractual obligations as of august 31, 2019:
capital leases(4)                             182,720                   56,246                       90,773                      35,701                         
construction commitments                       37,969                   37,969                                                                                
(1)   debt balances represent principal maturities, excluding interest, discounts, and debt issuance costs.
(3)   operating lease obligations are inclusive of amounts accrued within deferred rent and closed store obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.
(4)   capital lease obligations include related interest.
(5)                                                     self-insurance reserves reflect estimates based on actuarial calculations. although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities, the timing of future payments are predictable based upon historical patterns. accordingly, we reflect the net present value of these obligations in our consolidated balance sheets.
our tax liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, was $20.5 million at august 31, 2019. approximately $1.8 million is classified as current liabilities and $18.7 million is classified as long-term liabilities. we did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments of the long-term liabilities due to uncertainties in the timing and amounts of the settlement of these tax positions.
off-balance sheet arrangements the following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august 31, 2019:
(in thousands)                       total other commitments standby letters of credit         $101,172
a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers compensation carriers.
there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. the standby letters of credit and surety bond arrangements expire within one year, but have automatic renewal clauses.
selected financial data and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). these non-gaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders value.
non-gaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. however, we have presented the non-gaap financial measures, as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative year-to-year operating results. furthermore, our management and compensation committee of the board use the above-mentioned non-gaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and use select measurements to determine payments of performance-based compensation. we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following reconciliation tables.

critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions. our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board. the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management:
self-insurance reserves we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation, general, products liability, property and vehicle liability; and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks. our self-insurance reserve estimates totaled $207.0 million at august 31, 2019, and $203.1 million at august 25, 2018. this change is primarily reflective of our growing operations, including inflation, increases in healthcare costs, the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked, as well as our historical claims experience.
the assumptions made by management in estimating our self-insurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience, judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels. we utilize various methods, including analyses of historical trends and use of a specialist, to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported. the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. when estimating these liabilities, we consider factors, such as the severity, duration and frequency of claims, legal costs associated with claims, healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors. in recent history, our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent, and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates. as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred, we will adjust our reserves accordingly.
management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self- insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks. arriving at these estimates, however, requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management, and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates. for example, changes in our assumptions about healthcare costs, the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness, the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates, causing our reserves to be overstated or understated. for instance, a 10% change in our self-insurance liability would have affected net income by approximately $16.3 million for fiscal 2019.
our liabilities for workers compensation, general and product liability, property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities; however, the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities. accordingly, we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be long-term using the risk-free interest rate as of the balance sheet date.
if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 25 basis points, net income would have been affected by approximately $1.3 million for fiscal 2019. our liability for health benefits is classified as current, as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks.
income taxes our income tax returns are audited by state, federal and foreign tax authorities, and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time. tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate. the contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits, changes in tax laws, litigation, appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions.
we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded. as of august 31, 2019, we had approximately $20.5 million reserved for uncertain tax positions.
we evaluate exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.
we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years; however, actual results could differ from our estimates, and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. specifically, management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions. additionally, to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or must pay in excess of recognized reserves, our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected.
based on our vendor agreements, a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is earned as we purchase inventory. therefore, we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory. during the year, we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations. we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have not experienced significant losses and typically have a legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them. historically, we have had write-offs less than $1 million in each of the last three years.

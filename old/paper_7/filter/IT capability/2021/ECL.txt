item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following management discussion and analysis ("md&a") provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. we provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and reportable segment level. we also provide quantitative information regarding special (gains) and charges, discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature. qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance.
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10-k. our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. this discussion contains various non-gaap financial measures and also contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. we refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled "non-gaap financial measures" at the end of this md&a, and "forward-looking statements" and "risk factors" within items 1 and 1a of this form 10-k. we also refer readers to the tables within the section entitled "results of operations" of this md&a for reconciliation information of non-gaap measures to u.s. gaap.
comparability of results purolite acquisition on december 1, 2021, we acquired purolite for total consideration of $3.7 billion in cash. purolite is a leading and fast-growing global provider of high-end ion exchange resins for the separation and purification of solutions for pharmaceutical and industrial applications. headquartered in king of prussia, pennsylvania, purolite operates in more than 30 countries. purolite is reported within our life sciences operating segment. acquisition and integration charges are recorded within special (gains) and charges.
in addition, the remaining impacts of the purolite acquisition including operating results, acquisition-related amortization and interest expense related to the transaction have also been excluded from adjusted results.
championx transaction on june 3, 2020, we completed the previously announced separation of our upstream energy business (the "championx business") in a reverse morris trust transaction (the "transaction") through the split-off of championx holding inc. ("championx"), formed by ecolab as a wholly owned subsidiary to hold the championx business, followed immediately by the merger of championx (the "merger") with a wholly owned subsidiary of championx corporation (f/k/a apergy corporation, "apergy").
the championx business met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations because the separation of championx was a strategic shift in business that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. therefore, we report the historical results of championx, including the results of operations, cash flows, and related assets and liabilities, as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein. unless otherwise noted, the accompanying md&a has been revised to reflect the championx business as discontinued operations and prior year balances have been revised accordingly to reflect continuing operations only.
comparability of reportable segments effective in the first quarter of 2020, and in anticipation of the separation of the upstream energy business, we created the upstream and downstream operating segments from the global energy operating segment, which was also a reportable segment. subsequent to the separation of championx, we no longer report the upstream energy segment, which previously held the championx business.
the downstream operating segment has been aggregated into the global industrial reportable segment. also, in the first quarter of 2020, we announced leadership changes which allow for shared oversight and focus on the healthcare and life sciences operating segments and established the global healthcare & life sciences reportable segment. this segment is comprised of the healthcare operating segment which was previously aggregated in the global institutional reportable segment and the life sciences operating segment which was previously aggregated in the global industrial reportable segment. additionally, the textile care operating segment, which is now being reported in other, had previously been aggregated in the global industrial reportable segment. we also renamed the global institutional reportable segment to the global institutional & specialty reportable segment. we made other immaterial changes, including the movement of certain customers and cost allocations between reportable segments.
impact of acquisitions and divestitures acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture and the venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods. as part of the separation, we also entered into a master cross supply and product transfer agreement with championx to provide, receive or transfer certain products for a period up to 36 months. sales of product to championx under this agreement are recorded in product and equipment sales in the corporate segment along with the related cost of sales. these transactions are removed from the consolidated results as part of the calculation of the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.
fixed currency foreign exchange rates management evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our non-u.s. dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates, which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations. fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into u.s. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management, with all periods presented using such rates. public currency rate data provided within the "segment performance" section of this md&a reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period and is provided for informational purposes only.
executive summary in 2021, we delivered strong sales performance in an environment where covid-19 infections impacted business activity and further disrupted global supply chains which together, impacted the global recovery. delivered product cost inflation and other supply constraints increased significantly but we undertook extraordinary measures to assure our customers were supplied with our critical products and services. double-digit sales growth in the institutional & specialty and other segments along with strong industrial segment growth more than offset the healthcare & life sciences segment's decline versus a very strong gain last year. accelerating pricing and higher volume more than offset significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints, including the impact of texas freeze and hurricane ida, and the comparison to lower variable compensation last year.
sales reported sales increased 8% to $12.7 billion in 2021 from $11.8 billion in 2020. when measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, fixed currency sales increased 6% compared to the prior year. acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increased 5% compared to the prior year.
gross margin our reported gross margin was 40.2% of sales for 2021, compared to our 2020 reported gross margin of 41.4%. excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and impacts from the purolite transaction included in cost of sales from both 2021 and 2020, our adjusted gross margin was 40.9% in 2021 and 41.8% in 2020.
operating income reported operating income increased 15% to $1.6 billion in 2021, compared to $1.4 billion in 2020. adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and the impacts of the purolite transaction, increased 11% in 2021. when measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 8% in 2021.
reported continuing operations diluted eps increased 17% to $3.91 in 2021 compared to $3.33 in 2020. special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years. special (gains) and charges in 2021 include covid-19 related charges, restructuring charges, debt refinancing charges, acquisition and integration charges, and litigation and other charges. special (gains) and charges in 2020 include debt refinancing charges, restructuring charges, disposal and impairment charges, healthcare product recall charges, acquisition and integration charges, covid-19 related charges, and litigation and other charges. special (gains) and charges in 2019 were driven primarily by the impact of restructuring charges, discrete tax items, acquisition and integration charges and litigation and other charges. the impact of the purolite transaction was $0.02 per share dilutive to reported earnings per share from continuing operations (excluding special charges) as sales since its december 1, 2021 acquisition were more than offset by acquisition-related amortization and interest expense. adjusted continuing operations diluted eps, which exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, the impacts of the purolite transaction and discrete tax items increased 17% to $4.69 in 2021 compared to $4.02 in 2020.
balance sheet we remain committed to maintaining "a" range ratings metrics over the long-term, supported by our current credit ratings of a-/a3/a- by standard & poor's, moody's investor services and fitch, respectively. our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates.
net debt to ebitda our net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") was 3.4 and 2.4 for 2021 and 2020, respectively. we view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. see the "net debt to ebitda" table on page 44 for reconciliation information.
cash flow cash flow from continuing operations operating activities was $2.1 billion in 2021 compared to $1.7 billion in 2020. we continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, investments in our business, acquisitions, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments.
dividends we increased our quarterly cash dividend 6% in december 2021, bringing annual dividends declared to $1.95 per share. the increase represents our 30th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 85th consecutive year we have paid cash dividends. our outstanding dividend history reflects our long term growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap. our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements ("notes").
preparation of our consolidated financial statements, in conformity with u.s. gaap, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.
in march 2020, covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization. as the impact of the pandemic continues to evolve, estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require judgment. these estimates and assumptions may change in future periods and will be recognized in the consolidated financial
information as new events occur and additional information becomes known. to the extent actual results differ materially from those estimates and assumptions, our future financial statements could be affected.
besides estimates that meet the "critical" estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. all estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even from estimates not deemed critical. our critical accounting estimates include the following:
revenue recognition revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing service. revenue from product and sold equipment is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer of the product or delivery of the equipment. revenue from service and leased equipment is recognized when the services are provided, or the customer receives the benefit from the leased equipment, which is over time. service revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method and aligns with when the services are provided. typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date because the effort provided by the field selling and service organization represents services provided, which corresponds with the transfer of control. revenue for leased equipment is accounted for under topic 842 leases and recognized on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease contract.
our revenue policies do not provide for general rights of return. we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives based primarily on historical experience and anticipated performance over the contract period. depending on market conditions, we may increase customer incentive offerings, which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive. we also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits based on specific circumstances and credit conditions. we record an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on our estimates of expected future credit losses.
the revenue standard can be applied to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics if it is reasonable that the effects of applying the standard at the portfolio would not be significantly different than applying the standard at the individual contract level. we apply the portfolio approach primarily within each operating segment by geographical region. application of the portfolio approach was focused on those characteristics that have the most significant accounting consequences in terms of their effect on the timing of revenue recognition or the amount of revenue recognized. we determined the key criteria to assess with respect to the portfolio approach, including the related deliverables, the characteristics of the customers and the timing and transfer of goods and services, which most closely aligned within the operating segments. in addition, the accountability for the business operations, as well as the operational decisions on how to go to market and the product offerings, are performed at the operating segment level. for additional information on revenue recognition, refer to note 18.
litigation and environmental liabilities our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations.
we record liabilities related to pending litigation, environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs. we record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses. expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain. while the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals, and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position. for additional information on our commitments and contingencies, refer to note 16.
actuarially determined liabilities pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans the measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries. these assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses.
the significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate, expected return on assets, projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table.
●   the discount rate assumptions for our u.s. plans are assessed using a yield curve constructed from a subset of bonds yielding greater than the median return from a population of non-callable, corporate bond issues that have an average rating of aa when averaging available moody's investor services, standard &amp; poor's and fitch ratings. the discount rate is calculated by matching the plans' projected cash flows to the bond yield curve. for 2021 and 2020, we measured service and interest costs by applying the
specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows. we believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans' liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. in determining our u.s. pension obligations for 2021, our weighted-average discount rate increased to 2.86% from 2.48% at year-end 2020. in determining our u.s. postretirement health care obligation for 2021, our weighted-average discount rate increased to 2.75% from 2.37% at year-end 2020.
●   for postretirement benefit measurement purposes as of december 31, 2021, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed to be 6.75% for pre-65 costs and 7.25% for post-65 costs. the rates are assumed to decrease each year until they reach 4.5% in 2029 and remain at those levels thereafter.
●   in determining our u.s. pension and u.s. postretirement health care obligation for 2021, we utilized the most recent mortality table, mp-2021 projection scale (applied to the pri-2012 mortality table).
the effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of december 31, 2021, on the december 31, 2021 defined benefit obligation and 2022 expense is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant u.s. plans. expense amounts reflect the accounting for actuarial gains as a component of other comprehensive income and recognition of the impacts into income over the remaining service period:
effect on u.s. postretirement health care benefits plans increase in              higher assumption         recorded                 2022
our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans, with the majority of the amounts held in the u.k. and eurozone countries. we use assumptions similar to our u.s. plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations, however, the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information.
refer to note 17 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies, estimates, funded status, contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations.
self-insurance globally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses. we are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles, subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles. we are self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. we determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis.
income taxes judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions.
effective income tax rate our effective income tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions. we recognize the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances.
tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. as a result, the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns. some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense.
deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. based on the evaluation of available evidence, both positive and negative, we recognize tax assets, such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not. relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results, sources of future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes.
uncertain tax positions a number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter, for which we have established a liability for uncertain tax position, is audited and finally resolved. the number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. the internal revenue service ("irs") has completed examinations of our u.s. federal income tax returns through 2016 and the years 2017 and 2018 are currently under audit. in addition to the u.s. federal examinations, we have ongoing audit activity in several u.s. state and foreign jurisdictions.
the tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal, state and international jurisdictions. we believe our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations, and our liabilities for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken. because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations, we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits (including related interest and penalties) for amounts that do not meet the more-likely-than-not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance. the liability for uncertain tax positions is reviewed throughout the year, taking into account new legislation, regulations, case law and audit results. settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts, cash payments or receipts and/or adjustments to tax expense. liabilities for uncertain tax positions are presented in the consolidated balance sheets within other non-current liabilities. our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $25 million and $21 million as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. for additional information on income taxes refer to note 13.
long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill long-lived and amortizable intangible assets long-lived and amortizable intangible assets acquired are recorded on the acquisition date at their respective fair values based on the fair value requirements defined in u.s. gaap. this requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions relating to the present value of its future cash flows, such as growth rates, royalty rates or discount rates.
we review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $6.8 billion and $5.3 billion as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for impairment when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the manner in which asset or asset groups are being used or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset or asset group. impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset's or assets group's carrying amount over its estimated fair value.
we use the straight-line method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets, including our customer relationships. we consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships, including projected sales data, customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships.
globally, we have a broad customer base. our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions, including the customer bases acquired from our nalco, anios, cid lines and purolite transactions, which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships. our historical retention rate, coupled with our consistent track record of keeping long-term relationships with our customers, supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer bases. if our customer retention rates or other post-acquisition operational activities change materially, we would evaluate the financial impact and significances of the events given rise to the change which could result in impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets, or absent an impairment, an acceleration of amortization.
in addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. we have experienced no significant changes in the carrying amount or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets.
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets we had total goodwill of $8.1 billion and $6.0 billion as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter. our reporting units are aligned with our eleven operating segments.
for our annual 2021 goodwill impairment assessment, we completed a quantitative impairment assessment for each of our eleven reporting units using discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated assumptions, including future operating performance, long-term growth, and discount rates. our goodwill impairment assessments for 2021 indicated the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying amounts of the respective reporting units by a significant margin. we assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may be higher than its fair value. additionally, no events noted during the second half of 2021 indicated a need to update any of our analyses or conclusions reached in the second quarter of 2021 for any of our eleven reporting units. there has been no impairment of goodwill in any of the periods presented.
the nalco trade name is our only indefinite life intangible asset. during the second quarter of 2021, we completed our annual impairment assessment of the nalco trade name using the relief from royalty discounted cash flow method, which incorporates assumptions, including future sales projections, royalty rates and discount rates. our nalco tradename impairment assessment for 2021 indicated the estimated fair value of the nalco trade name exceeded its $1.2 billion carrying amount by a significant margin. there has been no impairment of the nalco trade name intangible since it was acquired.

our reported gross margin was 40.2%, 41.4%, and 43.9% for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. our 2021, 2020 and 2019 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special (gains) and charges of $93.9 million, $48.2 million, and $38.5 million, respectively. special (gains) and charges items impacting cos are shown within the "special (gains) and charges" table below.
excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and the impacts of the purolite transaction, our 2021 adjusted gross margin was 40.9% compared against a 2020 adjusted gross margin of 41.8%. the decrease primarily reflected increased pricing and higher volumes which were more than offset by significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints, including the impact of the texas freeze and hurricane ida.
the decreased sg&a ratio (sg&a expenses as a percentage of reported net sales) comparing 2021 against 2020 was driven primarily by higher net sales, cost savings initiatives and reduction in bad debt, partially offset by higher variable compensation compared to last year. the decreased sg&a ratio comparing 2020 against 2019 was driven primarily by lower incentive compensation, discretionary spend reductions and cost savings initiatives which offset the effects of lower sales.
special (gains) and charges special (gains) and charges reported on the consolidated statements of income included the following items:
cost of sales restructuring activities                           $24.7                  $7.4                 $20.4

for segment reporting purposes, special (gains) and charges are not allocated to reportable segments, which is consistent with our internal management reporting.
restructuring activities restructuring activities are primarily related to the institutional advancement program and accelerate 2020, both of which are described below. these activities have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges, and other (income) expense on the consolidated statements of income. restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
institutional advancement program we approved a restructuring plan in 2020 focused on the institutional business ("the institutional plan") which is intended to enhance our institutional sales and service structure and allow the sales team to capture share and penetration while maximizing service effectiveness by leveraging our ongoing investments in digital technology. in february 2021, we expanded the institutional plan, and expect that these restructuring charges will be completed by 2023, with total anticipated costs of $65 million ($50 million after tax) or $0.17 per diluted share. the costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance and facility closures. we also anticipate non-cash charges related to equipment disposals. actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken.
in 2021, we recorded total restructuring charges of $12.6 million ($10.2 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share, primarily related to severance, disposals of equipment and office closures. we have recorded $47.8 million ($36.6 million after tax), or $0.13 per diluted share of cumulative restructuring charges under the institutional plan. the liability related to the institutional plan was $5.1 million as of december 31, 2021. the majority of the pretax charges represent net cash expenditures which are expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters which continue to be funded from operating activities.
the institutional plan has delivered $41 million of cumulative cost savings with estimated annual cost savings of $50 million in continuing operations by 2024.
during 2018, we formally commenced a restructuring plan accelerate 2020 ("the plan"), to leverage technology and system investments and organizational changes. the goal of the plan is to further simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity and management layers, consolidated facilities and focus on key long-term growth areas by further leveraging technology and structural improvements. during 2020, we expanded the plan for additional costs and savings to further leverage the technology and structural improvements. following the establishment of the separate institutional plan, we now expect that the restructuring activities will be completed by the end of 2022, with total anticipated costs of $255 million ($195 million after tax), or $0.67 per diluted share, over this period of time, when revised for continuing operations. costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance costs and some facility closure costs relating to team reorganizations. actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken.
we recorded restructuring charges of $5.3 million ($6.2 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share in 2021. the liability related to the plan was $32.7 million as of the end of the year. we have recorded $244.5 million ($190.0 million after tax), or $0.66 per diluted share, of cumulative restructuring charges under the plan. the majority of the pretax charges represent net cash expenditures which are expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters which continue to be funded from operating activities.
the plan has delivered $300 million of cumulative cost savings with estimated annual cost savings of $315 million in continuing operations by 2022.

our reported operating income increased 15% when comparing 2021 to 2020 primarily driven by increased pricing and higher volume which more than offset significantly higher delivered product costs and supply constraints, including the impact of the texas freeze and hurricane ida and higher variable compensation compared to last year. our reported operating income decreased 24% when comparing 2020 to 2019 primarily due to the overall negative impact of the covid-19 pandemic on results, which yielded lower sales and reduced operating leverage, unfavorable business mix, more than offsetting cost savings, favorable pricing and higher variable compensation. our reported operating income for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was impacted by special (gains) and charges. excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and the impacts of the purolite transaction, 2021 adjusted operating income increased 11% when compared to 2020 adjusted operating income and 2020 adjusted operating income decreased 19% when compared to 2019 adjusted operating income.
our reported other income was $33.9 million, $55.9 million and $77.0 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. excluding the impact of settlements and curtailments recorded in special (gains) and charges during 2021, 2020 and 2019, our adjusted other income was $71.1 million, $56.3 million and $86.5 million, respectively, reflecting lower interest costs associated with future payments of employee pension obligations.

adjusted for special (gains) and charges and the purolite transaction, the decrease in interest expense when comparing 2021 against 2020 was driven primarily by a reduction in average debt levels and average interest rates. the increase in our 2020 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2019 was driven primarily by higher outstanding debt.

we recognized total net benefit related to discrete tax items of $57.7 million during 2019. share-based compensation excess tax benefit contributed $42.3 million in 2019. we recognized $15.6 million tax benefit related to changes in local tax law, which primarily includes $30.4 million benefit due to the passage of the swiss tax reform and ahv financing act, a swiss federal tax law, offset by a tax expense of $10.2 million due to the release of the final treasury regulation governing taxation of foreign dividends. we recorded changes in reserves in non-u.s. and u.s. jurisdictions due to audit settlements and statutes of limitations which resulted in a $13.8 million tax benefit. we finalized the 2015 and 2016 irs audit, which also resulted in discrete tax expense of $11.0 million. the remaining discrete tax expense was primarily related to changes in estimates in non-u.s. jurisdictions.
the change in our adjusted tax rates from 2019 to 2021 was primarily driven by global tax planning projects and geographic income mix. future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors, including but not limited to other changes in global tax rules, further tax planning projects and geographic income mix.

we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations, amidst the covid-19 pandemic, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in the business and pension obligations along with returning cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases.
cash provided by operating activities increased $320 million in 2021 compared to 2020, driven primarily by $159 million in increased net income, $94 million in higher tax expense accruals associated with higher income, and an increase in accruals for variable compensation, partially offset by $83 million of increased investment in working capital. cash provided by operating activities decreased $305 million in 2020 compared to 2019, driven primarily by $458 million of lower net income due to the impact of covid-19, partially offset by $160 million of improvement in working capital.
the impact on operating cash flows of pension and postretirement plan contributions, cash activity related to restructuring, cash paid for income taxes and cash paid for interest, are shown in the following table:
investing activities
cash used for investing activities           ($4,579.7)               ($857.7)               ($1,129.6)                ($3,722.0)                  $271.9
cash used for investing activities is primarily impacted by the timing of business acquisitions and dispositions as well as from capital investments in the business.
total cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired and net of cash received from dispositions, in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $3,924 million, $371 million and $385 million, respectively. our acquisitions and divestitures are discussed further in note 4. we continue to target strategic business acquisitions which complement our growth strategy and expect to continue to make capital investments and acquisitions in the future to support our long-term growth.
we continue to make capital investments in the business, including merchandising and customer equipment and manufacturing facilities. total capital expenditures were $643 million, $489 million and $731 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
financing activities
cash provided by (used for) financing activities           $1,603.2               ($340.2)               ($1,346.6)                $1,943.4                  $1,006.4
our cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the issuances and repayment of debt, common stock repurchases, proceeds from common stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs and dividend payments.
we issued $2,800 million par value and received $2,775 million in proceeds of long-term debt and repaid $900 million of long-term debt in 2021. we issued $1,850 million par value and received $1,856 million in proceeds of long-term debt and repaid $1,570 million of long-term debt in 2020. we repaid $401 million of long-term debt in 2019. the proceeds received from the debt issuances were used for the purolite acquisition, repayment of outstanding debt, repayment of commercial paper and general corporate purposes. in addition, we issued $394 million of commercial paper and notes payable in 2021 and repaid $66 million and $252 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
shares are repurchased for the purpose of partially offsetting the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans and stock issued in acquisitions, to manage our capital structure and to efficiently return capital to shareholders. we repurchased a total of $107 million, $146 million, and $354 million of shares in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
liquidity and capital resources we currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for the next twelve months, including scheduled debt repayments, new investments in the business, share repurchases, dividend payments, possible business acquisitions and pension and postretirement contributions with cash from operating activities, and as needed, additional short-term and/or long-term borrowings. we continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong.
as of december 31, 2021, we had $360 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $181 million was held outside of the u.s. as of december 31, 2020, we had $1,260 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $59 million was held outside of the u.s. we will continue to evaluate our cash position in light of future developments.
as of december 31, 2021, we had a $2.0 billion multi-year credit facility, which expires in april 2026. the credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks and supports our u.s. and euro commercial paper programs. the maximum aggregate amount of commercial paper that may be issued under our u.s. commercial paper program and our euro commercial paper program may not exceed $2.0 billion. at year end, we had $400 million outstanding commercial paper under our u.s. program and no commercial paper outstanding on our euro program. there were no borrowings under our credit facility as of december 31, 2021 or 2020. as of december 31, 2021, both programs were rated a-2 by standard & poor's, p-2 by moody's and f-1 by fitch.
we had a $305 million term credit agreement which we drew on and repaid $303 million during the second quarter of 2020. the credit agreement expired in june 2020.
additionally, we have uncommitted credit lines with major international banks and financial institutions. these credit lines support our daily global funding needs, primarily our global cash pooling structures. we have $118 million of bank supported letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees outstanding in support of our commercial business transactions. we do not have any other significant unconditional purchase obligations or commercial commitments.
as of december 31, 2021, standard & poor's and fitch both rated our long-term credit at a- (stable outlook) and moody's rated our long-term credit at a3 (stable outlook). a reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or negotiate new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities.
we are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures.
one-time transition tax       83                                     13                            70
as of december 31, 2021, our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $25 million. we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required. therefore, these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.
we do not have required minimum cash contribution obligations for our qualified pension plans in 2021. we are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements. we estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate $49 million in 2022. these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.
we lease certain sales and administrative office facilities, distribution centers, research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longer-term operating leases. vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration. vehicle leases have residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles.
market risk we enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing monitoring and reporting, and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows.
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements, and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than u.s. dollars. we use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. as of december 31, 2021, we had a total of €1,150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges.
we enter into cross-currency swap derivative contracts to hedge certain euro denominated exposures from our investments in certain of its euro denominated functional currency subsidiaries. we use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. as of december 31, 2021, we had €425 million of cross-currency swap derivative contracts outstanding designated as a net investment hedge.
refer to note 9 for further information on our hedging activity.
based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10% change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increase/decrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately $278 million. the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.
global economic and political environment covid-19
in march 2020, the covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization. the covid-19 pandemic is continuing to affect major economic and financial markets and industries are facing the challenges with the economic conditions resulting from efforts to address the pandemic, including supply shortages, inflation and other challenges, such as those resulting from the introduction of vaccination mandates. while many government restrictions in the u.s. have eased throughout 2021, restrictions on activities continue in many other regions, particularly those where vaccination rates lag, continuing to impact consumer activity in those regions. concerns remain that our markets could see a resurgence of cases triggering additional government mandated lockdowns or similar restrictions on activity, for example due to the emergence of a variant against which existing vaccines are not as effective or which may be more easily transmitted, particularly to those unvaccinated. these conditions have had and will continue to have a negative impact on market conditions and customer demand throughout the world.
global economies approximately half of our sales are outside of the u.s. our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results.
argentina has continued to experience negative economic trends, evidenced by multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the argentine peso, and increasing borrowing rates. argentina is classified as a highly inflationary economy in accordance with u.s. gaap, and the u.s. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in argentina. during 2021, sales in argentina represented less than 1% of our consolidated sales. assets held in argentina at the end of 2021 represented less than 1% of our consolidated assets.
in february 2022, the u.s. and the european union responded to russia's invasion of ukraine by imposing various economic sanctions. the u.s. and other countries could impose wider sanctions or take further actions if the conflict escalates. while it is difficult to anticipate the impact the sanctions may have on ecolab, any further sanctions imposed or actions taken by the u.s. or other countries, or any retaliatory measures by russia in response, could increase our costs, reduce our sales and earnings or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations. during 2021, net sales to russia and ukraine were approximately 1% of consolidated net sales.
non-gaap financial measures this md&a includes financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap. these non-gaap measures include:
●  acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales
●  acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income
●  acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin
●  ebitda
●  adjusted diluted eps from continuing operations we provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. we use these non-gaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.
our non-gaap adjusted financial measure for net sales excludes purolite sales. our non-gaap adjusted financial measures for cost of sales, gross margin, operating income, other (income) expense and interest expense exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges and (with the exception of other (income) expense) the impact of the purolite transaction, and our non-gaap measures for tax rate, net income from continuing operations attributable to ecolab and diluted eps from continuing operations further exclude the impact of discrete tax items. we include items within special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items that we believe can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results. after tax special (gains) and charges are derived by applying the applicable local jurisdictional tax rate to the corresponding pre-tax special (gains) and charges.
ebitda is defined as the sum of net income including non-controlling interest, provision for income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization. ebitda is used in our net debt to ebitda ratio, which we view as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization.
acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture and the venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods. in addition, as part of the separation, we also entered into a master cross supply and product transfer agreement with championx to provide, receive or transfer certain products for a period up to 36 months. sales of product to championx under this agreement are recorded in product and equipment sales in the corporate segment along with the related cost of sales. these transactions are removed from the consolidated results as part of the calculation of the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.
these non-gaap measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to u.s. gaap, and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. we recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the u.s. gaap measures included in this md&a and we have provided reconciliations of reported u.s. gaap amounts to the non-gaap amounts.

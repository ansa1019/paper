item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
introduction and overview the following management's discussion and analysis ("md&a"), should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements ("financial statements") in item 8 and the forward-looking statements and the risk factors set forth in item 1a. all note references herein refer to the notes to the financial statements. tabular amounts are displayed in millions of u.s. dollars except per share and unit count amounts, or as otherwise specifically identified. percentages may not recompute due to rounding.
yum! brands, inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as the "company", "yum", "we", "us" or "our") franchise or operate a system of over 53,000 restaurants in 157 countries and territories, primarily under the concepts of kfc, taco bell, pizza hut and the habit burger grill (collectively, the "concepts"). the company's kfc, taco bell and pizza hut brands are global leaders of the chicken, mexican-style and pizza food categories, respectively. the habit burger grill, a concept we acquired in march 2020, is a fast-casual restaurant concept specializing in made-to-order chargrilled burgers, sandwiches and more. of the over 53,000 restaurants, 98% are operated by franchisees.
•the kfc division which includes our worldwide operations of the kfc concept
•the taco bell division which includes our worldwide operations of the taco bell concept
•the pizza hut division which includes our worldwide operations of the pizza hut concept
•the habit burger grill division which includes our worldwide operations of the habit burger grill concept through our recipe for growth and good we intend to unlock the growth potential of our concepts and yum, drive increased collaboration across our concepts and geographies and consistently deliver better customer experiences, improved unit economics and higher rates of growth. key enablers include accelerated use of technology and better leverage of our systemwide scale.
our recipe for growth is based on four key drivers:
•unrivaled culture and talent: leverage our culture and people capability to fuel brand performance and franchise success
•unmatched operating capability: recruit and equip the best restaurant operators in the world to deliver great customer experiences
•bold restaurant development: drive market and franchise expansion with strong economics and value our global citizenship and sustainability strategy, called the recipe for good, reflects our priorities for socially responsible growth, risk management and sustainable stewardship of our people, food and planet.
we intend to drive long-term growth and shareholder returns primarily through consistent same-store sales growth and new unit development across all of our concepts. we intend to support this growth and development through a capital and operating structure that:
•targets a capital structure of ~5.0x earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") consolidated net leverage;
•invests capital in a manner consistent with an asset light, franchisor model;
•allocates g&a in an efficient manner that provides leverage to operating profit growth while at the same time opportunistically investing in strategic growth initiatives; and
•pays a competitive dividend and returns excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases.
we intend for this md&a to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our results of operations, including performance metrics that management uses to assess the company's performance. throughout this md&a, we commonly discuss the following performance metrics:
•same-store sales growth is the estimated percentage change in system sales of all restaurants that have been open and in the yum system for one year or more (except as noted below), including those temporarily closed. from time-to-time restaurants may be temporarily closed due to remodeling or image enhancement, rebuilding, natural disasters, health epidemic or pandemic, landlord disputes or other issues. throughout 2020 and 2021 we have had a significant number of restaurants that were temporarily closed including restaurants closed due to government and landlord restrictions as a result of covid-19. the system sales of restaurants we deem temporarily closed remain in our base for purposes of determining same-store sales growth and the restaurants remain in our unit count (see below). we believe same-store sales growth is useful to investors because our results are heavily dependent on the results of our concepts' existing store base. additionally, same-store sales growth is reflective of the strength of our brands, the effectiveness of our operational and advertising initiatives and local economic and consumer trends. in 2021 and 2020, when calculating respective same-store sales growth we also included in our prior year base the sales of stores that were added as a result of our acquisition of the habit restaurants, inc. on march 18, 2020, and that were open for one year or more. in 2019, when calculating same-store sales growth we also included in our prior year base the sales of stores that were added as a result of the food delivery brands group, s.a. (previously named telepizza group s.a. ("telepizza")) strategic alliance in december 2018 and that were open for one year or more. see additional discussion of the acquisition of the habit restaurants, inc. and telepizza strategic alliance within this md&a.
•gross unit openings reflects new openings by us and our franchisees. net new unit growth reflects gross unit openings offset by permanent store closures, by us and our franchisees. to determine whether a restaurant meets the definition of a unit we consider factors such as whether the restaurant has operations that are ongoing and independent from another yum unit, serves the primary product of one of our concepts, operates under a separate franchise agreement (if operated by a franchisee) and has substantial and sustainable sales. we believe gross unit openings and net new unit growth are useful to investors because we depend on new units for a significant portion of our growth. additionally, gross unit openings and net new unit growth are generally reflective of the economic returns to us and our franchisees from opening and operating our concept restaurants.
•system sales, system sales excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation ("fx"), and system sales excluding fx and the impact of the 53rd week in 2019 for our u.s. subsidiaries and certain international subsidiaries that operate on a weekly period calendar. system sales reflect the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including company-owned and franchise restaurants. sales at franchise restaurants typically generate ongoing franchise and license fees for the company at a rate of 3% to 6% of sales. increasingly, customers are paying a fee to a third party to deliver or facilitate the ordering of our concepts' products. we also include in system sales any portion of the amount customers pay these third parties for which the third party is obligated to pay us a license fee as a percentage of such amount. franchise restaurant sales and fees paid by customers to third parties to deliver or facilitate the ordering of our concepts' products are not included in company sales on the consolidated statements of income; however, any resulting franchise and license fees we receive are included in the company's revenues. we believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates our primary revenue drivers, company and franchise same-store sales as well as net unit growth.
in addition to the results provided in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america ("gaap"), the company provides the following non-gaap measurements.
•diluted earnings per share excluding special items (as defined below);
•effective tax rate excluding special items;
•core operating profit and core operating profit excluding the impact of the 53rd week in 2019. core operating profit excludes special items and fx and we use core operating profit for the purposes of evaluating performance internally;
•company restaurant profit and company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales (as defined below).
these non-gaap measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with gaap. rather, the company believes that the presentation of these non-gaap measurements provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
special items are not included in any of our division segment results as the company does not believe they are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature. our chief operating decision maker does not consider the impact of special items when assessing segment performance.
company restaurant profit is defined as company sales less company restaurant expenses, both of which appear on the face of our consolidated statements of income. company restaurant expenses include those expenses incurred directly by our company-owned restaurants in generating company sales, including cost of food and paper, cost of restaurant-level labor, rent, depreciation and amortization of restaurant-level assets and advertising expenses incurred by and on behalf of that company restaurant. company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales ("company restaurant margin %") is defined as company restaurant profit divided by company sales. we use company restaurant profit for the purposes of internally evaluating the performance of our company-owned restaurants and we believe company restaurant profit provides useful information to investors as to the profitability of our company-owned restaurants. in calculating company restaurant profit, the company excludes revenues and expenses directly associated with our franchise operations as well as non-restaurant-level costs included in general and administrative expenses, some of which may support company-owned restaurant operations. the company also excludes restaurant-level asset impairment and closures expenses, which have historically not been significant, from the determination of company restaurant profit as such expenses are not believed to be indicative of ongoing operations. company restaurant profit and company restaurant margin % as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in the industry.
certain performance metrics and non-gaap measurements are presented excluding the impact of fx. these amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. we believe the elimination of the fx impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations.
for 2019 we provided core operating profit excluding the impact of the 53rd week and system sales excluding fx and the impact of the 53rd week to further enhance the comparability given the 53rd week that was part of our fiscal calendar in 2019.
results of operations summary all comparisons within this summary are versus the same period a year ago and unless otherwise stated include the impact of a 53rd week in 2019. for discussion of our results of operations for 2020 compared to 2019, refer to the management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in part ii, item 7 of our form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2020, filed with the sec on february 22, 2021.
for 2021, gaap diluted eps increased 77% to $5.21 per share, and diluted eps, excluding special items, increased 23% to $4.46 per share.

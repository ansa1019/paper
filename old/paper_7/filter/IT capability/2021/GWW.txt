strategic priorities and impact of the covid-19 pandemic the company continues to adhere to its purpose to keep the world working while using its core principles as the framework for expanding grainger's leadership position and ensuring grainger is the go-to-partner for building and running safe, sustainable and productive operations. however, the company's business plans to achieve these strategic priorities continue to be affected by the impact of the covid-19 pandemic.
the covid-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions in the u.s. and global markets, and the full extent of the impacts will depend on several uncertain and unpredictable developments including any continued spread of the virus and its variants, the availability and effectiveness of treatments and vaccines, imposition of protective public safety measures and the overall impact of government measures to combat the spread of the virus.
while the ongoing recovery from the covid-19 pandemic has fluctuated throughout the year, it has been accompanied by a resurgence in demand as industries return to regular operations, which continues to disrupt supply chains, transportation efficiency, raw materials and labor availability. grainger's businesses and its major facilities have remained operational as customers rely on grainger's products and services to keep their businesses up and running. the company continues to monitor and refine its product assortment and inventory availability and remains committed to serving customers and supporting team members.
as the pandemic continues to impact global markets and the needs of customers, team members, suppliers and communities continue to change, the company's efforts and business plan will evolve accordingly. the company continues to leverage a dedicated cross-functional task force to understand and implement guidance from government agencies and health officials to meet requirements from federal, state and local authorities and may take further actions in the best interests of its team members, customers, suppliers and shareholders.
the company cannot reasonably estimate the full extent to which the covid-19 pandemic will continue to impact its business and financial results. grainger is focused on servicing customers and communities in addressing the pandemic and providing products to assist in the ongoing recovery, supporting the needs and safety of team members and ensuring the company continues to operate with a strong financial position.

gross profit of $4,720 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 increased $482 million, or 11%, compared to the same period in 2020. gross profit margin of 36.2% increased 0.3 percentage point compared to the same period in 2020. the increase was primarily driven by price realization and favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable pandemic-related inventory adjustments and product cost inflation in the year ended december 31, 2021.
operating earnings of $1,547 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 increased $528 million, or 52%, compared to the same period in 2020. the increase was driven by higher gross profit dollars and lower sg&a.
other expense, net of $62 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 decreased $10 million, or 13%, compared to the same period in 2020. the decrease was primarily driven by lower interest expense in 2021 due to the increase in indebtedness as a proactive measure to preserve financial flexibility during pandemic uncertainty in the first half of 2020.
income taxes of $371 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 increased $179 million, or 93%, compared to the same period in 2020. the increase was primarily driven by higher taxable operating earnings in 2021 and the absence of the tax impacts from the company's investment in fabory. in the first quarter of 2020, the company impaired and reorganized its holdings in fabory. in the second quarter of 2020, the company divested its interest in fabory. grainger's effective tax rates were 25.0% and 20.3% for the twelve months ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

sg&a of $3,219 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 increased $84 million, or 3%, compared to the same period in 2019. the increase was primarily due to a $177 million write-down of goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets for the fabory business and a $109 million pretax loss from the sale of the fabory business in the first and second quarters of 2020, respectively. these charges were partially offset by reduced travel and entertainment expenses in 2020 and an aggregate intangible asset impairment charge of $120 million for the cromwell business in the fourth quarter of 2019.
other expense, net of $72 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 increased $19 million, or 35%, compared to the same period in 2019. the increase was primarily from costs related to an increase in indebtedness as a proactive measure to preserve financial flexibility during pandemic uncertainty during 2020.
income taxes of $192 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 decreased $122 million, or 39%, compared to the same period in 2019. the decrease was driven by lower taxable operating earnings for the year, tax losses from the company's investment in fabory due to the impairment and internal reorganization of the company's holdings in fabory in the first quarter of 2020 and tax impacts of the fabory divestiture.
non-gaap measures the following tables reconcile reported sg&a expenses, operating earnings, net earnings attributable to w.w. grainger, inc. and diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) to non-gaap measures including adjusted sg&a, adjusted operating earnings, adjusted net earnings attributable to w.w. grainger, inc. and adjusted diluted earnings per share. the company believes that these non-gaap measures provide meaningful information to assist investors in understanding financial results and assessing prospects for future performance as they provide a better baseline for analyzing the ongoing performance of its businesses by excluding items that may not be indicative of core operating results. because non-gaap financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these measures with other companies' non-gaap measures having the same or similar names.

capital expenditures for the year ending december 31, 2021 and 2020, capital expenditures were $255 million and $197 million, respectively. the increase was due to the company's investment in the north american and japanese distribution networks. in addition, the company invested in the development of inventory management and technology enhancements.
project spending for 2022 is expected to be in the range of $275 million and $325 million, which includes dc investments in the u.s. and japan and it enhancements. grainger expects to fund 2022 capital spending primarily from operating cash flows.
debt grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. in addition to internally generated funds, grainger has various sources of financing available, including bank borrowings under lines of credit.
total debt, which is defined as total interest-bearing debt and lease liabilities as a percent of total capitalization, was 55.4% and 55.6%, as of december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
grainger receives ratings from two independent credit ratings agencies: moody's investor service (moody's) and standard & poor's (s&p). both credit rating agencies currently rate the company's corporate credit at investment grade. the following table summarizes the company's credit ratings at december 31, 2021:
commitments and other contractual obligations at december 31, 2021, the company's material cash requirements for commitments and other contractual obligations, included outstanding debt obligations (senior notes) with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $2,384 million, with no amount payable within 12 months. future interest payments associated with the senior notes total $1,921 million, with $87 million payable within 12 months.
additionally, as of december 31, 2021, the company had purchase obligations of $1,505 million, which includes $1,361 million payable within 12 months. grainger's purchase obligations primarily include commitments to purchase inventory and other goods and services and uncompleted additions to property, buildings and equipment. purchase obligations are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs. while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and non-inventory purchases are generally cancellable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of grainger's consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are in conformity with gaap and the company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company's management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts. the company considers an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) it involves assumptions that are uncertain when judgment was applied, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology, could have a significant impact on grainger's consolidated financial position and results. while the company believes the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable, the company's management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8: financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements.
inventories company inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale and are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. the majority of the company's inventory is accounted for using the last-in, first-out (lifo) method. net realizable value is based on an analysis of inventory trends including, but not limited to, reviews of inventory levels, sales and cost information and on-hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product and shelf-life. the company's methodology for estimating whether adjustments are necessary is continually evaluated for factors including significant changes in product demand, liquidation or disposition history values and market conditions such as inflation and other acquisition costs, including freight and duties. if business or economic conditions change, estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate.
goodwill and other intangible assets the company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if impairment indicators exist. the fair value of reporting units is calculated primarily using the discounted cash flow method and utilizing value indicators from a market approach to evaluate the reasonableness of the resulting fair values. the company's indefinite-lived intangible assets are primarily trade names. the fair value of trade names is calculated primarily using the relief-from-royalty method, which estimates the expected royalty savings attributable to the ownership of the trade name asset.
the estimates used to calculate the fair values of reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets involve the use of significant assumptions, estimates and judgments and changes from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, macroeconomic developments and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and impairment for each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset. for further information on the company's goodwill and other intangible assets, see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8: financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k.
contingencies and legal matters the company is subject to various claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. the company accrues for costs relating to litigation claims and other contingent matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. a detailed summary of the company's contingencies and legal matters is included in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8: financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k.

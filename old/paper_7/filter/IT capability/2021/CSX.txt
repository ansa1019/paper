(a) beginning third quarter 2021, the company changed the name of materials, supplies and other expense to purchased services and other, which better describes the composition of this expense amount. this change in naming convention does not impact previously reported results.
(b) all prior period share and per share data has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split effective june 28, 2021. certain prior year data has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
csx corporation part ii acquisition of quality carriers, inc.
on july 1, 2021, csx acquired quality carriers, inc. from quality distribution, inc. for a purchase price of $544 million in cash, which is presented on the statement of cash flows net of $3 million cash acquired. this transaction was funded by cash on hand. for further details, refer to note 17, business combinations.
covid-19 update demand for rail services has improved from steep declines in the first half of 2020, but the effects of the disruption of global manufacturing, supply chains and consumer spending as a result of the covid-19 global pandemic are ongoing. future impacts of the pandemic on the company's financial and operating results will be determined by its duration, effects on the demand for the company's transportation services and the supply chain, as well as the effect of governmental regulations imposed and legislative stimulus packages passed in response to the pandemic. the duration of the pandemic is dependent on several factors, including the impacts of virus mutations and case resurgences across the country.
csx employees that provide efficient and reliable rail service are essential to keeping supply chains fluid in response to this challenge. accordingly, business operations have been modified to ensure the safety of employees across the network while continuing to provide a high level of service to customers. the company is strongly encouraging employees to get vaccinated. a cross-functional task force continues to monitor and coordinate the company's response to covid-19.

(b) effective third quarter 2021, trucking revenue is comprised of revenue from the operations of quality carriers, which was acquired by csx effective july 1, 2021.
csx corporation part ii revenue total revenue increased $1.9 billion in 2021, or 18%, when compared to the previous year due to higher volume, the inclusion of quality carriers' results, pricing gains, increases in other revenue and higher fuel recovery.
merchandise volume chemicals - decreased due to lower shipments of crude oil and other energy-related commodities, partially offset by higher shipments of core chemicals and waste.
intermodal volume increases in both domestic and international shipments resulted from strong demand, tight truck capacity, inventory replenishments and growth in rail volumes from east coast ports.
coal volume the increase in export coal was driven by higher international shipments of both thermal coal and metallurgical coal. domestic coal increased due to higher shipments of utility coal as well as higher steel and industrial shipments.
trucking revenue trucking revenue increased $410 million versus prior year due to the inclusion of quality carriers' results.
labor and fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. these expenses increased $275 million due to the following items:
•the acquisition of quality carriers resulted in increased costs of $61 million.
•other costs decreased $42 million primarily due to efficiency savings, lower severance expenses and other non-significant items, partially offset by expenses related to increased hiring and new retention programs of $38 million.
purchased services and other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal and pier services, purchased trucking and other transportation, and professional services. this category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. total purchased services and other expenses increased $416 million driven by the following:
•the inclusion of quality carriers' operations drove $257 million of additional costs.
•all other costs increased $79 million primarily due to inflation and other non-significant costs, including $17 million in expenses related to the acquisition of quality carriers.
depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of capital assets, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over their respective useful lives, which are reviewed periodically as part of depreciation studies. this expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. depreciation expense increased $37 million primarily due to a larger net asset base, which includes quality carriers' assets, partially offset by the impacts of the 2020 road and track depreciation study.
equipment and other rents expense includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by csxt for use of its equipment. this category of expenses also includes expenses for short-term and long-term leases of locomotives, railcars, containers, tractors and trailers, offices and other rentals. these expenses increased $26 million primarily due to increased car hire costs driven by higher days per load and the addition of quality carriers' costs, partially offset by other non-significant items.
gains on property dispositions increased to $454 million in 2021 from $35 million in 2020 primarily due to the conveyance of a permanent land easement to the commonwealth of virginia that resulted in a $349 million gain in april 2021 as well as other property dispositions throughout 2021.
other income - net other income - net includes investment gains, losses and interest income, as well as components of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost and other non-operating activities. other income increased $60 million primarily due to $48 million debt repurchase expense in the prior year and an increase in net pension benefit credits during 2021, partially offset by lower interest income.
net earnings and earnings per diluted share net earnings increased $1 billion to $3.8 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $0.48 to $1.68, due to the factors mentioned above. average shares outstanding was lower as a result of share repurchase activity during the year and had a favorable impact on earnings per diluted share.
2020 vs. 2019 results of operations see below for discussion regarding operating expenses and earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to the year ended december 31, 2019. these discussion items have been updated to conform to the current presentation due to the reclassification of gains on property dispositions from the purchased services and other caption to gain on property dispositions, which had no impact on operating income, as well as the three-for-one stock split effective june 28, 2021.
labor and fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. these expenses decreased $341 million due to the following items:
•other costs increased $33 million primarily due to inflation and several other non-significant items, including severance costs.

•efficiency and volume savings of $185 million primarily resulted from lower operating support costs, lower terminal costs as a result of record productivity levels at intermodal terminals, and reduced equipment maintenance expenses.
depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of capital assets, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over their respective useful lives, which are reviewed periodically as part of depreciation studies. this expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. depreciation expense increased $34 million primarily due to the impacts of the 2019 equipment depreciation study as well as a larger net asset base.
equipment and other rents expense includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by csxt for use of its equipment. this category of expenses also includes expenses for short-term and long-term leases of locomotives, railcars, containers, tractors and trailers, offices and other rentals. these expenses decreased $14 million primarily due to volume savings, partially offset by higher days per load for automotive and other merchandise markets that resulted in increased car hire costs.
gains on property dispositions decreased to $35 million in 2020 from $151 million in 2019.
net earnings and earnings per diluted share net earnings decreased $566 million to $2.8 billion, and earnings per diluted share decreased $0.19 to $1.20. average shares outstanding was lower as a result of share repurchase activity during the year and had a favorable impact on earnings per diluted share.
csx corporation part ii non-gaap measures (unaudited)
csx reports its financial results in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). csx also uses certain non-gaap measures that fall within the meaning of securities and exchange commission regulation g and regulation s-k item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results. non-gaap measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by gaap. therefore, csx's non-gaap measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. the presentation of these non-gaap measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with gaap. reconciliations of non-gaap measures to corresponding gaap measures are below.
free cash flow management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the company's financial performance. more specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. this measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on outstanding debt. free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities, which includes proceeds from property dispositions. this measure should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. free cash flow before dividends increased $1.2 billion year-over-year to $3.8 billion primarily due to higher net cash provided by operating activities and higher proceeds and advances from property dispositions, including $400 million of proceeds related to the conveyance of a permanent land easement to the commonwealth of virginia in 2021. these increases were partially offset by higher property additions.
the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (gaap measure) to free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow (both non-gaap measures).
net cash provided by operating activities (a)            $5,099                      $4,263
property additions                                      (1,791)                     (1,626)
other investing activities (b)                              525                           9
(a) net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2020, includes the impact of $21 million paid to settle a liability for non-controlling interest in an affiliate.
(b) for the year ended december 31, 2020, certain other investing activities used in the calculation of free cash flow do not include the impact of a $30 million deposit paid by the company related to its signed definitive agreement to acquire pan am railways, inc. this transaction remains subject to regulatory review and approval by the surface transportation board. this deposit is included in the other investing activities total on the consolidated cash flow statement for the year ended december 31, 2020.
operations performance train velocity (miles per hour)(a)             17.9                        20.2                                 (11)           %
(a) the methodologies for calculating train velocity, dwell and cars online differ from those prescribed by the stb as the company believes these numbers more accurately reflect railroad performance. csxt will continue to report these metrics, using the prescribed methodology, to the stb on a weekly basis. see additional discussion on the company's website.
key performance measures definitions:
train velocity - average train speed between origin and destination in miles per hour (does not include locals, yard jobs, work trains or passenger trains). train velocity measures the profiled schedule of trains (from departure to arrival and all interim time), and train profiles are periodically updated to align with a changing operation.
on-time arrivals - percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard on-time to within two hours of scheduled arrival. carload trip plan performance - percent of measured cars destined for a customer that arrive at or ahead of the original estimated time of arrival, notification or interchange (as applicable).
csx corporation part ii the company is committed to continuous improvement in safety and service performance through training, innovation and investment. training and safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can adversely impact employees, customers and communities. technological innovations that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents are designed to serve as an additional layer of protection for the company's employees. continued capital investment in the company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance.
despite the operating challenges presented by global supply disruptions and the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, the company remained focused on safety, service, and controlling costs. train velocity declined 11% relative to 2020. dwell increased by 15% and cars online increased 17% in 2021. compared to 2020, carload and intermodal trip plan performance decreased 10% and 3%, respectively. csx expects network fluidity to improve commensurate with ongoing hiring efforts and a return to more normal supply chain conditions.
from a safety perspective, the fra personal injury index increased by 12% while the train-accident rate improved by 8% from the prior year. safety remains a top priority at csx, and the company is committed to reducing risk and enhancing the overall safety of its employees, customers and communities in which the company operates.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a company's ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements. to have a complete picture of a company's liquidity, its sources and uses of cash, balance sheet and external factors should be reviewed.
significant cash flows the following charts highlight the operating, investing and financing components of the change in cash and cash equivalents for operating, investing and financing activities for full years 2021 and 2020.
in 2021, the company generated $5.1 billion of cash from by operating activities, which was $836 million higher than prior year primarily driven by higher cash-generating income and favorable working capital activities. net cash used in investing activities was $1.9 billion, an increase in net spend of $1.2 billion from the prior year primarily as a result of decreased net sales of short-term investments and cash paid to acquire quality carriers, partially offset by higher proceeds and advances from property dispositions. net cash used in financing activities was $4.1 billion, which represents an increase in net spend of $2.7 billion from the prior year primarily driven by higher share repurchases and lower proceeds from debt issuances, partially offset by lower debt repayments.
csx corporation part ii sources of cash and liquidity the company has multiple sources of liquidity, including cash generated from operations and financing sources. simultaneous with the filing of this form 10-k, the company intends to file a new shelf registration statement, which may be used to issue debt or equity securities at csx's discretion, subject to market conditions and csx board authorization. while csx seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit csx to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. in 2021, csx did not issue any new long-term debt.
csx has access to a $1.2 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks that expires in march 2024. as of december 31, 2021, the company had no outstanding balances under this facility. see note 10, debt and credit agreements for more information. the company also has a commercial paper program, backed by the revolving credit facility, under which the company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion outstanding at any one time. as of december 31, 2021, the company had no outstanding debt under the commercial paper program.
uses of cash csx uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, working capital requirements, reduction or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness, redemptions and repurchases of csx common stock, dividends to shareholders, acquisitions and other business opportunities, and contributions to the company's qualified pension plan.
in 2021, csx continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. the company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term, profitable growth through optimizing network and terminal capacity. funds used for property additions are further described below.
fiscal years capital expenditures (dollars in millions)                  2021                      2020
strategic projects and commercial facilities             194                       143
total capital expenditures                            $1,791                     1,626
planned capital investments for 2022 are expected to be approximately $2.0 billion. of the 2022 investment, over 80% is expected to be used to sustain the core infrastructure and operating equipment. the remaining amounts will be used to promote profitable growth, including projects supporting service enhancements and productivity initiatives. csx intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations.
csx is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the company's ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. csx may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's operations and financial performance in the future (see risk factors under item 1a of this form 10-k).
csx corporation part ii csx is committed to returning cash to shareholders. capital structure, capital investments and cash distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, are reviewed at least annually by the board of directors. on february 16, 2022, the company's board of directors authorized a 7% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.10 per common share effective march 2022. management's assessment of market conditions and other factors guides the timing and volume of repurchases. future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances.
material changes in the consolidated balance sheets and working capital csx's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of csx's balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend payments and share repurchases. further, csx is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. the company ended the year with $2.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders' equity increased $738 million from prior year end. the increase in total assets was primarily due to a net increase in property of $571 million attributable to capital expenditures and the consolidation of quality carrier's properties, the recognition of $393 million of goodwill and intangible assets related to the acquisition of quality carriers, a $236 million increase in accounts receivable commensurate with higher revenue and a $226 million increase in net assets for qualified pension plans primarily driven by favorable discount rates. these increases were partially offset by the $890 million decrease in cash described above.
total liabilities increased $348 million from year end primarily due to an increase in deferred tax liabilities of $215 million driven by accelerated tax depreciation, an increase in accounts payable of $154 million due to the timing of payments, an increase in labor and fringe benefit payable of $148 million partly due higher expected incentive compensation payouts, the assumption of $68 million in debt as a result of the acquisition of quality carriers, and an increase in income and other taxes payable of $61 million. these and other increases were offset by debt repayments of $426 million. total shareholders' equity increased $390 million from year end primarily driven by net earnings of nearly $3.8 billion, mostly offset by share repurchases of $2.9 billion and dividends paid of $839 million.
working capital is considered a measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term needs. csx had a working capital surplus of $1.6 billion at december 2021 and $2.4 billion at december 2020, a decrease of $782 million. the decrease in current assets was primarily driven by the net decrease in cash described above, partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable. the increase in current liabilities was due to higher accounts payable and labor and fringe payable, partially offset by lower current maturities of long-term debt.
the company's working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances. although the company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for csx or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. the company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. furthermore, csx has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. the company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity.
csx corporation part ii completed and pending transactions acquisition of quality carriers, inc.
on july 1, 2021, csx acquired quality carriers, inc. from quality distribution, inc. for a purchase price of $544 million in cash, which is presented on the statement of cash flows net of $3 million cash acquired. this transaction was funded by cash on hand. for further details, refer to note 17, business combinations.
proposed acquisition of pan am systems, inc.
on november 30, 2020, csx signed a definitive agreement to acquire pan am systems, inc. ("pan am") which is the parent company of pan am railways, inc. who jointly owns pan am southern, llc with a subsidiary of norfolk southern corporation. pan am owns and operates a highly integrated, nearly 1,200-mile rail network and has a joint interest in the more than 600-mile pan am southern system. this acquisition, if approved, will expand csx's reach in the northeastern united states. assets and facilities to be acquired as part of the proposed transaction include road and track assets, work equipment, land, buildings and other assets. on february 25, 2021, the company began the process of seeking approval from the stb. on january 13 and 14, 2022, the company participated in a hearing before the stb to discuss the proposed transaction and a decision is expected by mid-april 2022. this proposed acquisition is not expected to be material with respect to the company's financial statements when reviewed under the quantitative and qualitative considerations of regulation s-x article 11 and asc 805, business combinations.
sale of property rights to the commonwealth of virginia on march 26, 2021, the company entered into a comprehensive agreement to sell certain property rights in three csx-owned line segments to the commonwealth of virginia ("commonwealth") over three phases for a total of $525 million. the timing and amount of gains recognized are based on the allocation of fair value to each conveyance, the timing of future conveyances and collectability. in april 2021, upon closing of the first phase of the agreement, the company collected $200 million in proceeds and recognized a $349 million gain. in fourth quarter 2021, the company collected additional proceeds of $200 million, a portion of which was attributable to the first phase with the remaining attributable to the second phase. there was no gain recognized in fourth quarter 2021 related to this agreement. as the second phase closed on january 10, 2022, the resulting $20 million gain will be recognized in first quarter 2022.
csx corporation part ii credit ratings credit ratings reflect an independent agency's judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. the ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower's industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company's cash flows to changes in the economy. the two largest rating agencies, standard & poor's ratings services ("s&p") and moody's investors service ("moody's"), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. the highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is aaa and aaa for s&p and moody's, respectively. a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.
the cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by csx's long-term credit ratings. csx's credit ratings remained stable during 2021. as of december 2021 and december 2020, s&p's long-term rating on csx was bbb+ (stable), and moody's was baa1 (stable). ratings of bbb- and baa3 or better by s&p and moody's, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. if csx's credit ratings were to decline to below investment-grade levels, the company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. in addition, a decline in csx's credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market's demand, and thus the company's ability to readily issue new debt. the company is committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile.
guaranteed notes issued by csxt in 2007, csxt, a wholly-owned subsidiary of csx corporation, issued in a registered public offering $381 million of secured equipment notes maturing in 2023. csx corporation has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the notes. at csxt's option, csxt may redeem any or all of the notes, in whole or in part, at any time, at the redemption price including premium. in the case of loss or destruction of any item of equipment securing the notes, if csxt does not substitute another item of equipment for the item suffering such loss or destruction, csxt will be required to redeem the notes in part at par. the guarantee of the notes will rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior obligations of csx corporation and will be effectively subordinated to all future secured indebtedness of csx corporation to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness. the guarantee is subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain customary conditions. as of december 31, 2021, the principal balance of these secured equipment notes was $149 million.
in accordance with sec rules, including amendments adopted in 2020, csx is not required to present separate condensed consolidating financial information for wholly-owned subsidiaries who issued or guaranteed notes. additionally, presentation of combined summary financial information regarding subsidiary issuers and guarantors is not required because the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the combined issuers and guarantors of the notes are not materially different from the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements.
csx corporation part ii contractual obligations, other commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations csx is party to contractual arrangements that obligate the company to make future cash payments. these obligations impact the company's liquidity and capital resource needs. the company's contractual obligations primarily consist of long-term debt and related interest payments, purchase commitments, leases, other-post employment benefits and agreements with conrail.
•as of december 31, 2021, the company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities. see note 10, debt and credit agreements, for additional information related to future debt payments. future interest payments associated with outstanding debt total $13.5 billion, with $699 million payable in 2022.
•purchase commitments consist of csx's long-term locomotive maintenance program and other commitments to purchase technology, communications, railcar maintenance and other services. see note 8, commitments and contingencies, for additional information about future payments related to purchase commitments.
•the company's leases include property, equipment, and line leases. see note 7, leases, for additional information about future payments related to leases.
•other post-employment benefits include estimated other post-retirement medical and life insurance payments and payments under non-qualified pension plans that are unfunded. see note 9, employee benefit plans, for additional information about future payments under such plans.
•conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of csx and ns. this is known as the shared asset area. conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. see note 15, investment in affiliates and related-party transactions, for additional information about future payments related to agreements with conrail.
other commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements other commitments total $153 million and primarily consist of guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds, none of which are individually significant. these off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
csx corporation part ii labor agreements approximately 16,500 of the company's over 20,900 employees are members of a labor union. for the 13 rail unions that participate in national bargaining, a round of negotiations for benefits, wages and work rules is underway. typically, these negotiations take several years. current agreements remain in place until modified by new agreements.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results may differ from those estimates. these estimates and assumptions are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis. significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:
personal injury and environmental reserves personal injury personal injury reserves of $118 million and $131 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively, represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. csxt retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. the methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. it is based largely on csxt's historical claims and settlement experience. actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. for additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see note 5, casualty, environmental and other reserves, in the consolidated financial statements.
environmental environmental reserves were $108 million and $76 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. the company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 220 environmentally impaired sites. the company reviews its potential liability with respect to each site identified, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:
•nature of the company's alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);
•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.
csx corporation part ii critical accounting estimates, continued conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. for additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see note 5, casualty, environmental and other reserves, in the consolidated financial statements.
pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. for employees hired prior to 2003, the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. for employees hired between 2003 and 2019, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. beginning in 2020, the csx pension plan was closed to new participants. as of december 2021, the projected benefit obligation for the company's pension plans was $3.0 billion.
in addition to these plans, the company sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide certain benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees hired prior to 2003 upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. beginning in 2019, both the life insurance benefit for eligible active management employees and health savings account contributions made by the company to eligible retirees younger than 65 were eliminated. beginning in 2020, the employer-funded health reimbursement arrangements for eligible retirees 65 years or older were eliminated. as of december 2021, the projected benefit obligation for the company's other post-retirement benefit plans was $81 million.
for information related to the funded status of the company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, see note 9, employee benefit plans.
the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the compensation-retirement benefits topic in the asc. this rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:
the company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company determines are appropriate based on historical trends, current market rates and future projections. these amounts are reviewed by management.
csx corporation part ii critical accounting estimates, continued discount rates discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the service and interest cost components of pension and post-retirement expense. discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the company's expected future benefit payments. the company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year-end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments.
the company measures the service and interest cost components of the net pension and post-retirement benefits expense by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year. under the spot rate approach, individual spot discount rates along the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities are applied to the relevant projected cash flows at the relevant maturity.
the weighted average discount rates used by the company to value its 2021 pension and post-retirement obligations are 2.78% and 2.51%, respectively. for 2020, the weighted average discount rates used by the company to value its pension and post-retirement obligations were 2.43% and 2.07%, respectively. discount rates may differ for pension and post-retirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan. as of december 2021, the estimated duration of pensions and post-retirement benefits is approximately 12 years and 8 years, respectively.
each year, these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. in general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change.
long-term rate of return on plan assets the expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. in estimating that rate, the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. management, with the assistance of an outsourced investment manager, balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. as this assumption is long term, the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting. the long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the company to value its benefit cost for the subsequent plan year was 6.75% in both 2021 and 2020.
salary scale inflation rates salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the company. the company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. the company used a salary scale rate of 4.60% in both 2021 and 2020 to value its pension obligations.
other assumptions the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. these assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are determined by management.
csx corporation part ii critical accounting estimates, continued
2022 estimated pension and post-retirement expense net periodic pension and post-retirement benefits expenses for 2022 are expected to be credits of $42 million and $5 million, respectively. net periodic pension and post-retirement benefits expenses for 2022 are expected to include service cost expense of $32 million and $1 million, respectively. service cost expense is included in labor and fringe on the consolidated income statement and all other components of net pension expense and post-retirement benefits expense are included in other income - net. net periodic pension expense and post-retirement benefits expense in 2021 were credits of $17 million and $5 million, respectively. the net increase in the expected credit is primarily due to impacts from the increase in discount rates and recent favorable pension asset experience.
the following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effects of a 1% change in certain assumptions like discount rates, long-term rate of return and salaries on the 2022 estimated pension and post-retirement expense:
long-term rate of return                   $28           n/a salary inflation                            $4           n/a depreciation policies for assets utilizing the group-life method the depreciable assets of the company are depreciated using either the group-life or straight-line method of accounting, which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with gaap. the company depreciates its railroad assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 86% of total fixed assets of $46.5 billion on a gross basis at december 31, 2021. the remaining depreciable assets of the company, including non-railroad assets and assets under finance leases, are depreciated using the straight-line method on a per asset basis. land is not depreciated.
management performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis. under the group-life method, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management's methods to determine the service lives of its properties. there are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include:
•previous assessment of the condition of the assets;
•comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.
csx corporation part ii critical accounting estimates, continued the stb requires depreciation studies be performed every three years for equipment assets (e.g., locomotives and freight cars) and every six years for road and track assets (e.g., bridges, signals, rail, ties, and ballast). the company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2019, both of which resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation, service lives, salvage values, and other related factors for certain assets. recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation and depreciation rates that did not materially affect the company's depreciation expense of $1.4 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. a 1% change in the average estimated useful life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $12 million change to the company's annual depreciation expense. for additional details, including a more detailed description of our related accounting policies, see note 6, properties, in the consolidated financial statements.
goodwill and intangible assets as of december 2021, the company had $451 million of goodwill and other intangibles - net. csx recognized $213 million of goodwill and $180 million of intangible assets as a result of the quality carriers acquisition effective july 1, 2021.
in applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, management must determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between depreciable and amortizable assets and goodwill. the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital.
csx evaluates goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. in performing the qualitative impairment assessment, csx considers relevant events and conditions, including but not limited to: macroeconomic trends, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, company-specific events, and legal and regulatory factors. if the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts, the company would perform a quantitative impairment test. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill or intangible asset exceeded the fair value under the quantitative test, an impairment loss would be recorded. measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit could be based on one or more of the following fair value measures: amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, present value techniques of estimated future cash flows, valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue, or a similar performance measure.

overview we are the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the u.s. and worldwide. our mission is to deliver great value to our customers every day. we do this by selling a rapidly changing assortment of apparel, home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below full-price retailers' (including department, specialty, and major online retailers) regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day through our stores and five distinctive branded e-commerce sites. we operate nearly 4,700 stores through our four main segments: in the u.s., marmaxx (which operates t.j. maxx, marshalls, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com) and homegoods (which operates homegoods, homesense, and homegoods.com); tjx canada (which operates winners, homesense and marshalls in canada); and tjx international (which operates t.k. maxx, homesense and tkmaxx.com in europe, and t.k. maxx in australia). in addition to our four main segments, sierra operates sierra.com and retail stores in the u.s. the results of sierra are included in the marmaxx segment.
results of operations matters affecting comparability the covid-19 pandemic continued to impact the u.s. and other countries around the world in fiscal 2022. during fiscal 2022, while our stores in the u.s. and all of our e-commerce businesses remained open for the entire period, we did have government-mandated temporary store closures in europe, canada and australia, resulting in our stores being closed in the aggregate for approximately 4% of fiscal 2022. additionally, intermittently throughout the year, we operated under government-mandated shopping restrictions, including capacity limitations. stores were temporarily closed for approximately 24% of fiscal 2021 due to temporary closures across all geographies. overall, our fiscal 2022 results were significantly better than our fiscal 2021 results.
in addition to comparing current year results to fiscal 2021, we may, where meaningful, also compare these results to a comparable period in the fiscal year ended february 1, 2020, prior to the emergence of the pandemic. we believe this additional comparison provides insight into how we are managing the business and performing as compared to our pre-pandemic results.
highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2022 include the following:
-net sales were $48.5 billion, $32.1 billion, and $41.7 billion for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020, respectively. as of january 29, 2022, the number of stores in operation increased approximately 3% and selling square footage increased 2% compared to the end of fiscal 2021.
-diluted earnings per share were $2.70 for fiscal 2022, which included a debt extinguishment charge of $0.15 per share, compared to $0.07 for fiscal 2021, which included a debt extinguishment charge of $0.19 per share, and $2.67 for fiscal 2020.
-pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) was 9.1%, 0.3%, and 10.6% for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020, respectively.
-our cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, ratio was 71.5%, 76.3%, and 71.5% for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020, respectively.
-our selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expense ratio was 18.7%, 21.8%, and 17.9% for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020, respectively.
-our consolidated average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers (which excludes inventory in transit) and excluding our e-commerce sites and sierra stores, were up 31% on a reported basis and 32% on a constant currency basis at the end of fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021, and we were up 3% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis at the end of fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2020.
operating results as a percentage of net sales the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales.
cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs              71.5              76.3              71.5
income before income taxes*                                       9.1     %         0.3     %   10.6        %
recent events and trends divestiture of equity investment subsequent to the fiscal year ended january 29, 2022, given the recent russian invasion of ukraine, we committed to divesting our equity ownership in familia. as of march 2, 2022, douglas mizzi and scott goldenberg have resigned from their director and observer positions, respectively, on familia's board of directors, effective immediately. as a result of this commitment to divest, we may recognize an investment loss of up to $225 million. prior to divestiture, we may be required to record an impairment charge if the fair value of our investment in familia declines below its carrying value on our consolidated balance sheets.
in fiscal 2020, we invested $225 million for a 25% non-controlling, minority interest in privately held familia. familia, domiciled in luxembourg, is an off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions with more than 400 stores in russia. we account for our investment in familia using the equity method of accounting. as of january 29, 2022, the carrying value of our investment in familia was $186 million, which reflects the revaluing of the investment from russian rubles to the u.s. dollar, resulting in a cumulative translation loss and reducing the carrying value of our investment by approximately $40 million. see additional information on the equity investment in note a-basis of presentation and summary of accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements.
the significant impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our global retail operations that began during fiscal 2021 continued to impact our business in fiscal 2022. we entered fiscal 2022 with significant ongoing global uncertainty related to the pandemic. the health and safety of our associates and customers remained a top priority during fiscal 2022, and we continue to monitor developments, including government requirements and recommendations that could result in possible additional impacts to our operations.
net sales net sales totaled $48.5 billion, $32.1 billion, and $41.7 billion for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. net sales from our e-commerce sites combined amounted to less than 3% of total sales for each of fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020.
as a result of the extensive temporary store closures during fiscal 2021 due to the covid-19 pandemic and our practice relating to the treatment of extended temporary store closures when calculating comp store sales, we had no stores classified as comp stores at the end of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021.
for fiscal 2022, we temporarily reported open-only comp store sales, as described below. for fiscal 2023, we intend to return to our historical definition of comparable store sales. while stores in the u.s. were open for all of fiscal 2022, a significant number of stores in tjx canada and tjx international experienced covid-19 related temporary store closures and government-mandated shopping restrictions during fiscal 2022. therefore, we cannot measure year-over-year comparable store sales with fiscal 2022 in these geographies in a meaningful way. as a result, the comparable stores included in the fiscal 2023 measure will consist of u.s. stores only, which, we intend to refer to as u.s. comparable store sales and will be calculated against sales for the comparable periods in fiscal 2022. our historical definition of comp store sales is also presented below for reference.
net sales increased 51% in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. our stores in the u.s. and all of our e-commerce businesses remained open for the entire period, while we had temporary closures in europe, canada, and australia resulting in our stores being closed in the aggregate for approximately 4% of fiscal 2022, as compared to stores across all geographies being temporarily closed for approximately 24% for fiscal 2021. in addition to stores being open for more days in fiscal 2022, net sales further increased due to higher customer traffic and increased average basket.
net sales increased 16% and open-only comp store sales were up 15% for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2020. u.s. open-only comp store sales were up 17% for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2020. this reflects an increase in average basket across all divisions. customer traffic was up in the u.s., where stores were open for all of fiscal 2022, and was down in geographies where we had covid-19 related temporary store closures and government-mandated shopping restrictions. our open-only comp store sales increase in home fashions was significantly above our overall open-only comp increase. in apparel, we had strong open-only comp store sales growth during fiscal 2022 compared to the same period in fiscal 2020.
historical comparable store sales historically, we defined comparable store sales, or comp sales, to be sales of stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. we calculated comp sales on a 52-week basis by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. relocated stores and stores that have changed in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated comp percentage is immaterial.
-new stores - stores that have not yet met the comp sales criteria, which represents a substantial majority of non-comp sales
-stores that are closed permanently or for an extended period of time
-sales from our e-commerce sites, meaning sierra.com, tjmaxx.com, marshalls.com, homegoods.com and tkmaxx.com we determine which stores are included in the comp sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed permanently or for an extended period during that fiscal year. beginning in fiscal 2020, sierra stores that fit the comp store definition were included in comp stores in our marmaxx segment.
comp sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current year's comp sales using the prior year's exchange rates. this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance.
comp sales may be referred to as "same store" sales by other retail companies. the method for calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry, therefore our measure of comp sales may not be comparable to that of other retail companies.
we define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores and average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold. we define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions.
open-only comp store sales due to the temporary closing of stores as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, our historical definition of comp store sales is not applicable for the reported periods. since the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we temporarily reported open-only comp store sales. open-only comp store sales includes stores initially classified as comp stores at the beginning of fiscal 2021 that had to temporarily close due to the covid-19 pandemic. this measure reports the sales increase or decrease of these stores for the days the stores were open in the current period against sales for the same days in fiscal 2020, prior to the pandemic. open-only comp store sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current year using fiscal 2020's exchange rates.
revenues by geography the percentages of our consolidated revenues by geography for the last three fiscal years are as follows:
united states:
total united states                        79     %          79     %          76     %
impact of foreign currency exchange rates our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the u.s. dollar or a division's local currency in relation to other currencies. we specifically refer to "foreign currency" as the impact of translational foreign currency exchange and mark-to-market of inventory derivatives, as described in detail below. this does not include the impact foreign currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an operating division's local currency referred to as "transactional foreign exchange," also described below.
translation foreign exchange in our consolidated financial statements, we translate the operations of tjx canada and tjx international from local currencies into u.s. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in assets, liabilities, net sales, net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. currency translation generally does not affect operating margins, or affects them only slightly, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at approximately the same rates within a given period.
mark-to-market inventory derivatives we routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions, principally tjx canada and tjx international. as we have not elected "hedge accounting" for these instruments, as defined by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. in subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark-to-market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is received and paid for. while these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. the mark-to-market adjustment on these derivatives does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report.
transactional foreign exchange when discussing the impact on our results of the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on certain transactions, we refer to it as "transactional foreign exchange". this primarily includes the impact that foreign currency exchange rates may have on the year-over-year comparison of merchandise margin as well as "foreign currency gains and losses" on transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the operating division's local currency. these two items can impact segment margin comparison of our foreign divisions and we have highlighted them when they are meaningful to understanding operating trends.
cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, was $34.7 billion, or 71.5% of net sales, $24.5 billion, or 76.3% of net sales, $29.8 billion, or 71.5% of net sales for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively.
the increase in the total cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, was primarily due to the additional cost of merchandise sold due to a higher level of sales in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. our stores were temporarily closed in the aggregate for approximately 4% of fiscal 2022 and approximately 24% of fiscal 2021. merchandise margin improved during fiscal 2022, primarily driven by favorable markdowns, offset by increased freight costs. in addition, supply chain costs increased due to additional investments in distribution capacity and higher wages, which, along with freight costs, are expected to continue into the next fiscal year.
cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, was favorably impacted by approximately $27 million and $78 million of government programs for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively, in regions where we had temporary store closures.
the expense ratio was flat for fiscal 2022 compared to the fiscal 2020. the ratio reflects the leverage on our occupancy costs due to the strong open-only comp store sales growth. within merchandise margin, strong markon and lower markdowns more than offset approximately 200 basis points of incremental freight costs in fiscal 2022. the occupancy and merchandise margin improvements were offset by higher supply chain costs primarily due to additional investments to expand distribution capacity and higher wage costs.
selling, general and administrative expenses sg&a expenses were $9.1 billion, or 18.7% of net sales, $7.0 billion, or 21.8% of net sales and $7.5 billion, or 17.9% of net sales for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively.
the increase in sg&a expense for fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by higher store payroll costs to support a higher sales volume. in addition to these costs, incentive compensation costs and other variable store costs, such as advertising spend and credit processing fees, were higher in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021.
sg&a expense was favorably impacted by $214 million and $434 million from government programs for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively, in regions where we had temporary store closures.
the expense ratio increased 0.8% for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2020. the increase was driven by higher store payroll costs, primarily due to incremental covid-19 related payroll costs.
loss on early extinguishment of debt on june 4, 2021, we completed make-whole calls for our $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.50% notes maturing in 2025 and our $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% notes maturing in 2027. as a result of these redemptions prior to their scheduled maturities, we recorded a pre-tax debt extinguishment charge of $242 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. for additional information on the debt transactions, see note j-long-term debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements.
interest expense, net the components of interest expense, net for the last two fiscal years are summarized below:
capitalized interest                (4)               (5)
net interest expense decreased for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to the prior year's refinancing of certain notes in december 2020 as well as the $2.75 billion pay down of outstanding debt during fiscal 2022.
provision (benefit) for income taxes the effective income tax rate was 25.4%, (1.4)%, and 25.7% for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020, respectively. the increase in the fiscal 2022 effective income tax rate was primarily due to the significant increase in profit in fiscal 2022 as compared to the mix of income and losses by jurisdictions in fiscal 2021.
segment information we operate four main business segments. our marmaxx segment (t.j. maxx, marshalls, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com) and our homegoods segment (homegoods, homesense and homegoods.com) both operate in the united states. our tjx canada segment operates winners, homesense and marshalls in canada, and our tjx international segment operates t.k. maxx, homesense and tkmaxx.com in europe and t.k. maxx in australia. in addition to our four main segments, sierra operates sierra.com and retail stores in the u.s. the results of sierra are included in the marmaxx segment.
we evaluate the performance of our segments based on "segment profit or loss," which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense and interest expense, net, and certain separately disclosed unusual or infrequent items. "segment profit or loss," as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. the terms "segment margin" or "segment profit margin" are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. these measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity.
when discussing current year segment results, in addition to comparing to fiscal 2021, we may, where meaningful, also compare these results to a comparable period in fiscal 2020, prior to the emergence of the pandemic.
presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments.
segment profit                                                    $3,813              $891            $3,470
net sales net sales for marmaxx were $29.5 billion for fiscal 2022, an increase of 52% compared to $19.4 billion for fiscal 2021. the increase in net sales reflects stores remaining open for all of fiscal 2022. stores were closed for approximately 20% of fiscal 2021 as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. in addition to stores being open for more days in fiscal 2022, net sales further increased due to higher customer traffic and increased average basket.
net sales increased 15% compared to $25.7 billion for fiscal 2020. open-only comp store sales were up 13% compared to fiscal 2020. the increase in open-only comp store sales for fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by an increase in average basket. in addition, customer traffic was up slightly. while our open-only comp store sales increase in home fashions continued to significantly exceed those of apparel, we had strong open-only comp store sales growth in apparel for fiscal 2022. during fiscal 2022, we had strong sales at marmaxx across all geographic regions.
segment profit fiscal 2022 vs fiscal 2021
segment profit was $3.8 billion for fiscal 2022, an increase of $2.9 billion, compared to a segment profit of $0.9 billion for fiscal 2021. the increase was primarily driven by increased sales due to stores remaining open for all of fiscal 2022. merchandise margin improved primarily due to lower markdowns, partially offset by incremental freight costs. fiscal 2021 also benefited $171 million from government programs.
segment profit increased by $0.3 billion compared to a segment profit of $3.5 billion for fiscal 2020, primarily due to the increase in sales. segment profit margin decreased to 12.9% for fiscal 2022 compared to 13.5% for fiscal 2020. the decrease was primarily driven by incremental covid-19 related store payroll costs and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by leverage on occupancy costs due to the strong open-only comp store sales growth and improved merchandise margin. within merchandise margin, strong markon and lower markdowns collectively more than offset incremental freight costs.
our marmaxx e-commerce sites, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com, together with sierra.com, represented less than 3% of marmaxx's net sales for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 and did not have a significant impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons.
segment profit                                                      $907              $510              $681

general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. general corporate expenses are primarily included in sg&a expenses. the mark-to-market adjustment of our fuel hedges is included in cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs.
the increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by higher share-based and incentive compensation costs.
analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements have traditionally been funded through cash generated from operations, supplemented, as needed, by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. as of january 29, 2022, there were no short-term bank borrowings or commercial paper outstanding. we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities, under which facilities we have $1.5 billion available as of the period ended january 29, 2022, as described in note j-long-term debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements, are adequate to meet our operating needs for the foreseeable future.
as of january 29, 2022, we held $6.2 billion in cash. approximately $1.4 billion of our cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries with $0.6 billion held in countries where we intend to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings. we have provided for all applicable state and foreign withholding taxes on all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in canada, puerto rico, italy, india, hong kong and vietnam through january 29, 2022. if we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries, we should not incur additional tax expense and our cash would be reduced by the amount of withholding taxes paid.
we monitor debt financing markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may incur additional long-term indebtedness depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, existing economic conditions and other factors. during fiscal 2022 we have used, and in the future we may use, operating cash flow and cash on hand to repay portions of our indebtedness, depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, existing economic conditions, contractual restrictions and other factors. as such, we may, from time to time, seek to retire, redeem, prepay or purchase our outstanding debt through redemptions, cash purchases, prepayments, refinancings and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. if we use our operating cash flow and/or cash on hand to repay our debt, it will reduce the amount of cash available for additional capital expenditures.
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $3.1 billion in fiscal 2022 and $4.6 billion in fiscal 2021. our operating cash flows decreased by $1.5 billion compared to fiscal 2021 due to the $4.7 billion change in merchandise inventories net of accounts payable, driven by rebuilding inventory levels in fiscal 2022 as well as the timing of merchandise payments in fiscal 2021. in addition, operating cash flows were negatively impacted by the $0.3 billion decrease in net operating lease liabilities due to the repayment of many of the rent deferrals negotiated in fiscal 2021. the decrease in operating cash flows was partially offset by a $3.2 billion increase in net income. temporary store closures in fiscal 2021 resulted in net income of $0.1 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to net income of $3.3 billion in fiscal 2022.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $1.0 billion in fiscal 2022 and $0.6 billion in fiscal 2021. the cash outflows for both periods were primarily driven by capital expenditures and were lower in fiscal 2021 due to the covid-19 pandemic.
net cash used in investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two fiscal years as set forth in the table below:
store renovations and improvements              367               124
total capital expenditures                   $1,045              $568
we expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2023 will be in the range of approximately $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, including approximately $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion for our offices and distribution centers (including buying and merchandising systems and other information systems) to support growth, approximately $0.5 billion to $0.6 billion for store renovations and approximately $0.2 billion for new stores. we plan to fund these expenditures with our existing cash balances and through internally generated funds.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $6.2 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to net cash inflows of $3.2 billion in fiscal 2021. in fiscal 2022, the cash outflows were primarily driven by debt repayments, equity repurchases and dividend payments. in fiscal 2021, the cash inflows were primarily driven by debt transactions.
debt the cash outflows in fiscal 2022 were due to the completion of make-whole calls and the redemption at par of certain of our notes. the notes redeemed via make-whole calls were issued in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 in response to the covid-19 pandemic. as a result of these redemptions prior to their scheduled maturities, we recorded a pre-tax debt extinguishment charge of $242 million in fiscal 2022. additionally, in fiscal 2022 we redeemed at par $750 million principal outstanding, 2.75% notes due june 15, 2021. the result of these debt redemptions resulted in a $2.75 billion reduction of outstanding debt since the beginning of fiscal 2022 and will result in more than $90 million of annualized interest expense savings. the cash inflows in fiscal 2021 were a result of completing the issuance and sale of $4 billion aggregate principal amount of notes. see note j-long-term debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
equity in fiscal 2022, we lifted the temporary suspension of our repurchase program and we paid $2.2 billion to repurchase and retire 31.3 million shares of our stock on a settlement basis under our previously authorized stock repurchase programs. prior to the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program, we paid $0.2 billion to repurchase and retire 3.4 million shares on a settlement basis in fiscal 2021. these outflows for both periods were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, net of shares withheld for taxes, of $0.2 billion in both fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021.
in january 2022, the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to an additional $3.0 billion of our common stock from time to time. we currently plan to repurchase approximately $2.25 billion to $2.5 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2023. we determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow, liquidity, economic and market conditions, our assessment of prospects for our business, legal requirements, and other factors. the timing and amount of these purchases may change. as of january 29, 2022, approximately $3.8 billion remained available under our existing stock repurchase programs. for further information regarding equity repurchases, see note d-capital stock and earnings per share of notes to consolidated financial statements.
dividends we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock of $0.26 per share for each of the quarters in fiscal 2022 which totaled $1.04 per share in fiscal 2022. as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the covid-19 pandemic, no dividends were declared in the first nine months of fiscal 2021. cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $1.3 billion for fiscal 2022 and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2021. we expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2023 of $0.295 per share, or an annual dividend of $1.18 per share, subject to the declaration and approval by our board of directors. this would represent a 13% increase over the per share dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2022.
contractual obligations see the descriptions of our financing arrangements, commitments and contingencies, and contractual obligations outlined below and within the following notes to consolidated financial statements.
-see note j-long-term debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements for future payments under long-term debt arrangements (including current installments).
-see note l-leases of notes to consolidated financial statements. operating lease liabilities exclude legally binding minimum lease payments for approximately 170 leases signed but not yet commenced and include options to extend lease terms that are now deemed reasonably certain of being exercised according to our lease accounting policy. the balances do not include variable costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2022.
-see note m-accrued expenses and other liabilities, current and long term of notes to consolidated financial statements for long-term liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid, which includes $0.6 billion for employee compensation and benefits and $0.3 billion for uncertain tax positions.
-we also have non-cancellable purchase obligations under purchase orders for merchandise and under agreements for capital items, products and services used in our business, including executive employment and other agreements.
critical accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap which requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. these judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable. we consider our most critical accounting estimates, involving uncertainty requiring management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below.
inventory valuation we use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except t.k. maxx in australia. the businesses that utilize the retail method have some inventory that is initially valued at cost before the retail method is applied as it has not been fully processed for sale (i.e. inventory in transit and unprocessed inventory in our distribution centers). under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. it involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage. under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing management's discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns. inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods; however, we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end. we do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory.
reserves for uncertain tax positions similar to many large corporations, our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate, and such authorities may challenge positions we take. we are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters, which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation, assessment, examination, litigation and settlement. the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain. in accordance with gaap, we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions we have taken will not be sustained. however, in the next twelve months and in future periods, the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay, as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts, law, or legal interpretations, expiration of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals, refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made. final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
loss contingencies certain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. our management, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities. such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment. in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein.
if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the estimated liability in the consolidated financial statements. if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable.
recent accounting pronouncements for a discussion of any new accounting pronouncements, see note a-basis of presentation and summary of accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k. we do not expect any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

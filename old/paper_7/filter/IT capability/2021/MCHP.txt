introduction the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document, as well as with other sections of this annual report on form 10-k, including "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data." for an overview of our business and recent trends, refer to "part i item 1. business."
we begin our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) with a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results.  we then discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, followed by an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows, and discuss our financial commitments in the section titled "liquidity and capital resources." our liquidity and capital resources section generally discusses fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. for our discussion of our fiscal 2021 results compared to fiscal 2020 for both our results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources sections, refer to "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2021 filed with the sec on may 18, 2021, which is incorporated by reference herein.
critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap.  we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis.  the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities.  on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, business combinations, share-based compensation, inventories, income taxes, convertible debt and contingencies.  we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  our results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions.  we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.  we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we generate revenue primarily from sales of our semiconductor products to distributors and non-distributor customers (direct customers) and, to a lesser extent, from royalties paid by licensees of our intellectual property. we apply the following five-step approach to determine the timing and amount of revenue recognition: (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied.
sales to our distributors are governed by a distributor agreement, a purchase order, and an order acknowledgment. sales to distributors do not meet the definition of a contract until the distributor has sent in a purchase order, we have acknowledged the order, we have deemed the collectability of the consideration to be probable, and legally enforceable rights and obligations have been created. as is customary in the semiconductor industry, we offer price concessions and stock rotation rights to many of our distributors. as these are forms of variable consideration, we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled using recent historical data and applying the expected value method. after the transaction price has been determined and allocated to the performance obligations, we recognize revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied. substantially all of the revenue generated from contracts with distributors is recognized at, or near to, the time risk and title of the inventory transfers to the distributor.
sales to our direct customers are generally governed by a purchase order and an order acknowledgment. sales to direct customers usually do not meet the definition of a contract until the direct customer has sent in a purchase order, we have acknowledged the order and deemed the collectability of the consideration to be probable, and legally enforceable rights and obligations have been created. generally, the transaction price associated with contracts with direct customers is set at the standalone selling price and is not variable. after the transaction price has been determined and allocated to the performance obligations, we recognize revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied. substantially all of the revenue generated from contracts with direct customers is recognized at, or near to, the time risk and title of the inventory transfers to the customer.
revenue generated from our licensees is governed by licensing agreements. our primary performance obligation related to these agreements is to provide the licensee the right to use the intellectual property. the final transaction price is determined by multiplying the usage of the license by the royalty, which is fixed in the licensing agreement. revenue is recognized as usage of the license occurs.
business combinations all of our business combinations are accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting.  under the acquisition method of accounting, (i) acquisition-related costs, except for those costs incurred to issue debt or equity securities, will be expensed in the period incurred; (ii) non-controlling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date; (iii) in-process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the technology reaches technological feasibility; (iv) restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and (v) changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will be recognized through income tax expense.  the measurement of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant judgment.  the valuation of intangible assets, in particular, requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach.  the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates:  revenue, expenses, capital spending and other costs, and discount rates based on the respective risks of the cash flows.  under the acquisition method of accounting, the aggregate amount of consideration we pay for a company is allocated to net tangible assets and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.  the excess of the purchase price over the value of the net tangible assets and intangible assets is recorded to goodwill. on an annual basis, we test goodwill for impairment and through march 31, 2022, we have never recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill.
share-based compensation we utilize rsus with a service condition as our primary equity incentive compensation instrument for employees and also grant market-based and performance-based psus to executive officers and employees. share-based compensation cost for rsus with a service condition or performance-based psus is measured on the grant date based on the fair market value of our common stock discounted for expected future dividends and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods. we estimate the fair value of psus with a market condition using a monte carlo simulation model as of the date of grant using historical volatility. total share-based compensation expense recognized during the fiscal 2022 was $210.2 million, of which $175.9 million was reflected in operating expenses and $34.3 million was reflected in cost of sales. total share-based compensation included in our inventory was $7.5 million at march 31, 2022.
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities, we may be required to accelerate, increase or cancel any remaining unearned share-based compensation expense.  future share-based compensation expense and unearned share-based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions.
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method.  we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required.  inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable. in estimating reserves for obsolescence, we evaluate projected demand over periods that align with demand forecasts used to develop manufacturing plans and inventory build decisions and provide reserves for inventory on hand in excess of estimated demand. management reviews and adjusts the estimates as appropriate based on specific situations. for example, demand can be adjusted up for new products for which historic sales are not representative of future demand. alternatively, demand can be adjusted down to the extent any existing products are being replaced or discontinued.
in periods where our production levels are substantially below our normal operating capacity, the reduced production levels of our manufacturing facilities are charged directly to cost of sales. during fiscal 2022, we operated at above normal capacity levels. during fiscal 2021, we operated at below normal capacity levels primarily due to general economic conditions and uncertainty from the covid-19 pandemic resulting in unabsorbed capacity charges of $29.6 million.
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.  this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.  these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets.  we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.  we provided valuation allowances for certain of our deferred tax assets, where it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of such assets, will not be realized.
various taxing authorities in the u.s. and other countries in which we do business scrutinize the tax structures employed by businesses.  companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations. we are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the u.s. and in various foreign jurisdictions. at this time, we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be. we record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law. if this threshold is not met, no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized. if the threshold is met, we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.
the accounting model related to the valuation of uncertain tax positions requires us to presume that the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information and that each tax position will be evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other positions.  the recognition requirement for the liability exists even if we believe the possibility of examination by a taxing authority or discovery of the related risk matters is remote or where we have a long history of the taxing authority not performing an exam or overlooking an issue.  we will record an adjustment to a previously recorded position if new information or facts related to the position are identified in a subsequent period.  all adjustments to the positions are recorded through the income statement.  generally, adjustments will be recorded in periods subsequent to the initial recognition if the taxing authority has completed an audit of the period that results in the position being effectively settled or if the statute of limitation expires.  due to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process and in consideration of the criteria of the accounting model, amounts recognized in the financial statements in periods subsequent to the initial recognition may significantly differ from the estimated exposure of the position under the accounting model.
convertible debt upon issuance, we separately account for the liability and equity components of our convertible debt by estimating the fair values of the i) liability component without a conversion feature and ii) the conversion feature. this results in a bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income.
upon settlement of our convertible debt instruments, we allocate the total consideration between the liability and equity components based on the fair value of the liability component without the conversion feature. the difference between the consideration allocated to the liability component and the net carrying value of the liability component is recognized as an extinguishment loss or gain. the remaining settlement consideration is allocated to the equity component and recognized as a reduction of additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets. in addition, if the terms of the settlement are different from the contractual terms of the original instrument, we recognize an inducement loss, which is measured as the difference between the fair value of the original terms of the instrument and the fair value of the settlement terms.
determining the fair value of the liability component without the conversion feature upon issuance and settlement involves estimating the equivalent borrowing rate for a similar non-convertible instrument. given the values of these transactions, fair value estimates are sensitive to changes in the equivalent borrowing rate conclusions. the measurement of the equivalent borrowing rate requires that we make estimates of volatility and credit spreads to align observable market inputs with the instrument being valued.
lastly, we include the dilutive effect of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the outstanding convertible debt in our diluted income per share calculation regardless of whether the market price triggers or other contingent conversion features have been met. we apply the treasury stock method as we have the intent and have adopted an accounting policy to settle the principal amount of the convertible debt in cash. this method results in incremental dilutive shares when the average fair value of our common stock for a reporting period exceeds the conversion prices per share and adjusts as dividends are recorded in the future.
contingencies in the ordinary course of our business, we are exposed to various liabilities as a result of contracts, product liability, customer claims, governmental investigations and other matters.  additionally, we are involved in a limited number of legal actions, both as plaintiff and defendant.  consequently, we could incur uninsured liability in any of those actions.  we also periodically receive notifications from various third parties alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights, or from customers requesting reimbursement for various costs.  with respect to pending legal actions to which we are a party and other claims, although the outcomes are generally not determinable, we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.  litigation, governmental investigations and disputes relating to the semiconductor industry are not uncommon, and we are, from time to time, subject to such litigation, governmental investigations and disputes.  as a result, no assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any such litigation, governmental investigations or disputes in the future.
we accrue for claims and contingencies when losses become probable and reasonably estimable. as of the end of each applicable reporting period, we review each of our matters and, where it is probable that a liability has been or will be incurred, we accrue for all probable and reasonably estimable losses. where we can reasonably estimate a range of losses we may incur regarding such a matter, we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate. if we can reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other, we use the amount that is the low end of such range. contingencies of an acquired company that exist as of the date of the acquisition are measured at fair value if determinable, which generally is based on a probability weighted model. if fair value is not determinable, contingencies of an acquired company are recognized when they become probable and reasonably estimable.
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021:
gross profit                                                                                                          65.2                    62.1
research and development                                                                                              14.5                    15.4
amortization of acquired intangible assets                                                                            12.7                    17.1
net sales we operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design, development, manufacture and sale of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of our superflash and other technologies.  we sell our products to distributors and oems in a broad range of markets, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral.  in certain circumstances, a customer's financial condition may require collateral, and, in such cases, the collateral would be typically provided in the form of letters of credit.
the following table summarizes our net sales for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 (dollars in millions):
2022                          2021                               change net sales                                                            $6,820.9                   $5,438.4      25.4               %
the increase in net sales in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to strong business conditions that began in the second half of fiscal 2021 as businesses and individuals adapted to the effects of the covid-19 pandemic. business conditions continued to be exceptionally strong in fiscal 2022. additionally, semiconductor industry conditions have resulted in increased costs throughout our supply chain, which we have been passing on to our customers in the form of price increases. these price increases also contributed to the increase in net sales during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. our price increases were implemented at various times and in various amounts throughout fiscal 2022 with respect to our very broad range of customers and products. due to the complexity of the implementation of the price increases and the changes in product, geographic and customer mix, we are not able to quantify the impact of the price increases on our net sales.
the net sales value of inventory at our distributor customers increased $11.2 million during fiscal 2022 compared to a decrease of $10.4 million during fiscal 2021. excluding the impact of changes in distributor inventory levels on net sales, net sales increased by 25.0% in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. our price increases positively impacted net sales during fiscal 2022. additionally, demand for our products was positively impacted by strength in our microcontroller and analog product lines. due to the size, complexity and diversity of our customer base, we are not able to quantify any material factor contributing to the change other than net demand fluctuations in the end markets that we serve.
other factors that we believe contributed to changes in our reported net sales for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 and which are drivers of long-term trends in our net sales but which factors we are not able to quantify include:
•semiconductor industry conditions;
•our various new product offerings that have increased our served available market;
•customers' increasing needs for the flexibility offered by our programmable solutions; and
•increasing semiconductor content in our customers' products through our total systems solutions.
we sell a large number of products to a large and diverse customer base and there was not any single product or customer that accounted for a material portion of the change in our net sales in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021.
net sales by product line for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions):
microcontrollers                                                                                                        $3,814.8                   56.0                     $2,961.0                   54.5
microcontrollers our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales.  microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 56.0% and 54.5% of our net sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.
net sales of our microcontroller products increased approximately 28.8% in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. the increase in net sales was due primarily to strength in demand for our microcontroller products in end markets that we serve and our price increases.
historically, average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product. however, the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have increased in recent periods and have remained relatively stable over time due to the proprietary nature of these products.  we have in the past been able to, and expect in the future to be able to, moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices.
analog our analog product line includes analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products. our analog product line accounted for approximately 28.4% and 27.9% of our net sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.
net sales from our analog product line increased approximately 27.6% in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. the increase in net sales was primarily due to strength in demand for our analog products in end markets that we serve and our price increases.
we consider a majority of the products in our analog product line to be proprietary in nature, where prices are relatively stable, similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products. the non-proprietary portion of our analog product line will experience price fluctuations, driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products.
other our other product line includes fpga products, royalties associated with licenses for the use of our superflash and other technologies, sales of our intellectual property, fees for engineering services, memory products, timing systems, manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting), legacy application specific integrated circuits, and certain products for aerospace applications. revenue from these services and products accounted for approximately 15.6% and 17.6% of our net sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.
net sales related to these products and services increased approximately 11.4% in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. the increase in net sales was primarily due to strength in demand for our products in end markets that we serve and our price increases. net sales of our other product line can fluctuate over time based on general economic and semiconductor industry conditions as well as changes in demand for our fpga products, licenses, engineering services, memory products, and manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting).
distribution distributors accounted for approximately 48% and 50% of our net sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. the decrease in the distribution percentage of our total net sales is due to lower preferred supply program participation among our distributors as priority of supply under the preferred supply program is more prevalent with direct customers. no distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021. our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers. we believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base.  we believe that customers recognize microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel.
generally, we do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and we, or our distributors, may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advance notice, with the exception of orders placed under our preferred supply program.  the loss of, or the disruption in the operations of, one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns.
at march 31, 2022, our distributors maintained 17 days of inventory of our products compared to 22 days at march 31, 2021. over the past ten fiscal years, the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 17 days and 40 days. inventory holding patterns at our distributors may have a material impact on our net sales. our distributor inventory days are at historic lows due to the imbalance between the supply of and the demand for our products in the current supply-constrained environment.
sales by geography sales by geography for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions):
americas sales include sales to customers in the u.s., canada, central america and south america. sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 78% and 77% of our net sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. substantially all of our foreign sales are u.s. dollar denominated. sales to customers in europe as a percentage of total net sales increased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to strength in demand in our microcontroller and analog product lines. our sales force in the americas and europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to asia.
gross profit our gross profit in fiscal 2022 was $4.45 billion, or 65.2% of net sales, compared to $3.38 billion, or 62.1% of net sales, in fiscal 2021. the following table summarizes the material and primary drivers of our change in gross profit as a percentage of net sales, with the material factors discussed in more detail below the table (dollars in millions):
gross profit                             %
845.4                                    -        increase in semiconductor net sales at prior year gross margins and excluding the impact of other factors quantified in this table

unabsorbed capacity charges - when production levels are below normal capacity, which we measure as a percentage of the capacity of the installed equipment, we charge cost of sales for the unabsorbed capacity. we consider normal capacity at fab 2 and fab 4 to be 90% to 95%. we consider normal capacity at fab 5 to be 70% to 75%. during fiscal 2022, we operated at above normal capacity levels and we expect this to continue if the current supply constraints relative to demand continue. during fiscal 2021, we operated at below normal capacity levels primarily due to general economic conditions and uncertainty from the covid-19 pandemic resulting in unabsorbed capacity charges of $29.6 million. we adjust our wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity utilization as required to respond to actual and anticipated business and industry-related conditions.
net impact of product mix and average gross profit per unit - the net impact of product mix and average gross profit per unit may fluctuate over time due to sales volumes of lower or higher margin products, changes in selling prices, and fluctuations in product costs. during fiscal 2022, product mix resulted in a decrease of $152.5 million in cost of goods sold and an increase in gross profit compared to fiscal 2021.
we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time, driven primarily by capacity utilization levels, the overall product mix of microcontroller, analog, fpga products, memory products, and technology licensing revenue and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter, as well as manufacturing yields, fixed cost absorption, and competitive and economic conditions in the markets we serve. we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs.
we operate assembly and test facilities in thailand, the philippines, and other locations throughout the world. during fiscal 2022, approximately 59% of our assembly requirements were performed in our internal assembly facilities, compared to approximately 53% during fiscal 2021. during fiscal 2022, approximately 64% of our test requirements were performed in our internal test facilities, compared to approximately 57% during fiscal 2021. the increases in the percentage of assembly and test operations that were performed internally in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 are primarily due to our investments in assembly and test equipment, which increased our internal capacity capabilities. third-party contractors located primarily in asia perform the balance of our assembly and test operations. the percentage of our assembly and test operations that are performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry, our internal capacity capabilities and our acquisition activities. we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our internal facilities provide us with significant cost savings compared to contractor assembly and test costs, as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process. we plan to continue to transition certain outsourced assembly and test capacity to our internal facilities.
we rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication requirements. approximately 60% of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries in fiscal 2022, compared to 61% in fiscal 2021.
our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract. while we review the quality, delivery and cost performance of our third-party contractors, our future operating results could suffer if any third-party contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields, assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels.
research and development r&d expenses for fiscal 2022 were $989.1 million, or 14.5% of net sales, compared to $836.4 million, or 15.4% of net sales, for fiscal 2021. we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products, including development systems software, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies.  we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position.  r&d costs are expensed as incurred.  assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives.  r&d expenses include labor, depreciation, masks, prototype wafers, and expenses for the development of process technologies, new packages, and software to support new products and design environments.
r&d expenses increased $152.7 million, or 18.3%, for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. the primary reason for the increase in r&d expenses in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was higher compensation costs. in the first half of fiscal 2021, we initially implemented measures to help prepare for economic uncertainty, such as employee salary cuts, limiting hiring, reducing business travel costs and discretionary spending. however, in december 2020, we restored previous reductions in compensation and resumed hiring.
r&d expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2022 were $718.9 million, or 10.5% of net sales, compared to $610.3 million, or 11.2% of net sales, for fiscal 2021.  our goal is to continue to be more efficient with our selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales, marketing and administrative personnel, advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses as well as costs related to our direct sales force, cems and eses who work remotely from sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $108.6 million, or 17.8%, for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. the primary reason for the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was higher compensation costs. in the first half of fiscal 2021, we initially implemented measures to help prepare for economic uncertainty, such as employee salary cuts, limiting hiring, reducing business travel costs and discretionary spending. however, in december 2020, we restored previous reductions in compensation and resumed hiring.
selling, general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.
amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets in fiscal 2022 was $862.5 million compared to $932.3 million in fiscal 2021. the primary reason for the decrease in acquired intangible asset amortization was due to the use of accelerated amortization methods.
special charges and other, net during fiscal 2022, we incurred special charges and other, net of $29.5 million primarily related to restructuring of acquired and existing wafer fabrication operations to increase operational efficiency, legal contingencies and exiting non-manufacturing facilities including contract termination costs, employee severance, and the disposal of assets. during fiscal 2021, we incurred special charges and other, net of $1.7 million primarily related to the restructuring of our wafer fabrication operations partially offset by asset sales and other acquisition related activity. restructuring expenses incurred during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 include $21.1 million and $15.0 million, respectively, related to the restructuring of our wafer fabrication operations.
interest expense in fiscal 2022 was $257.0 million compared to $356.9 million in fiscal 2021. the primary reason for the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 relates to the cumulative pay down of our debt and lower interest rates on our outstanding variable rate debt.
loss on settlement of debt in fiscal 2022 was $113.4 million compared to $299.6 million in fiscal 2021. in fiscal 2022, the losses primarily related to the settlement of a portion of our outstanding 2015 senior convertible debt, our 2017 senior convertible debt, and our 2017 junior convertible debt as well as the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement and the repayment of $1.00 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 3.922% 2021 notes. in fiscal 2021, the losses primarily related to the settlement of a portion of our outstanding 2015 senior convertible debt, our 2017 senior convertible debt, and our 2017 junior convertible debt as well as the payment of all amounts outstanding under our bridge loan facility, and our term loan facility. the net losses recognized on the settlement of our convertible debt are comprised of two components (i) the inducement loss, which is the excess of the fair value of the consideration provided to the holder over the fair value of the debt and (ii) the extinguishment loss or gain, which is the difference between the fair value of the debt component and the carrying value on the settlement date.
other income, net, in fiscal 2022 was $2.8 million compared to other loss, net of $3.8 million in fiscal 2021. the primary reasons for the change in other (loss) income, net during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 relates to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and gains on equity investments.
provision for income taxes our provision or benefit for income taxes is attributable to u.s. federal, state, and foreign income taxes. a comparison of our tax rates in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 is not meaningful due to the amount of pre-tax income, and income tax benefit recorded during the prior period.
our effective tax rate in fiscal 2022 includes a $49.5 million tax benefit received from current year generated r&d credits, which reduced our effective tax rate by 3.3%; a $17.6 million tax benefit for share-based compensation deductions, which reduced our effective tax rate by 1.2%; a $47.1 million tax benefit related to changes in various tax reserves, which reduced our effective tax rate by 3.2%; a $139.9 million tax expense for the effects of foreign operations, which increased our effective tax rate by 9.4%; and a $25.5 million tax benefit related to the settlement of convertible debt, which reduced our effective tax rate by 1.7%.
our effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 includes a $47.6 million tax benefit received from generated r&d credits, which reduced our effective tax rate by 14.0%; a $12.3 million tax benefit for share-based compensation deductions, which reduced our effective tax rate by 3.6%; a $28.1 million tax expense related to changes in various tax reserves, which increased our effective tax rate by 8.3%; a $122.5 million tax expense for the effects of foreign operations, which increased our effective tax rate by 36.1%; a $48.1 million tax benefit related to the settlement of convertible debt, which reduced our effective tax rate by 14.2%; and a $63.8 million tax benefit related to intra-group transfers of certain intellectual property rights, which reduced our effective tax rate by 18.8%. the tax benefit for the intra-group asset transfers primarily consisted of $155.5 million recorded as a deferred tax asset which represents the book and tax basis difference on the transferred assets measured based on the new applicable statutory tax rate, as well as the reversal of the pre-existing deferred tax asset of $90.3 million, which represents the book and tax basis difference on the transferred assets measured based on the applicable statutory tax rate prior to the transfer. over the next 15 years, we expect to be able to realize the future tax benefit of the deferred tax assets resulting from the intra-group asset transfers. it is not uncommon for taxing authorities of different countries to have conflicting views, for instance, with respect to, among other things, the manner in which the arm's length standard is applied with respect to the valuation of intellectual property rights. the taxing authorities of jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing the intellectual property rights transferred, which could increase our future effective income tax rate and harm our future results of operations.
we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions in which we have operations. the effective tax rates that we pay in these jurisdictions vary widely, but they are generally lower than our combined u.s. federal and state effective tax rate. our domestic blended statutory tax rate in each of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 was approximately 22%. our non-u.s. blended statutory tax rates in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 were lower than this amount. the difference in rates applicable in foreign jurisdictions results from a number of factors, including lower statutory rates, tax holidays, financing arrangements and other factors. our effective tax rate has been and will continue to be impacted by the geographical dispersion of our earnings and losses.
our foreign tax rate differential benefit primarily relates to our operations and assets in thailand and ireland. our thailand manufacturing operations are currently subject to numerous tax holidays granted to us based on our investment in property, plant, and equipment in thailand. our tax holiday periods in thailand expire at various times in the future; however, we actively seek to obtain new tax holidays, otherwise we will be subject to tax at the statutory tax rate of 20%. we do not expect the future expiration of any of our tax holiday periods in thailand to have a material impact on our effective tax rate.  the remaining material components of foreign income taxed at a rate lower than the u.s. are earnings accrued in ireland at a 12.5% statutory tax rate.
in september 2021, we received a statutory notice of deficiency (notice) from the internal revenue service (irs) for fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2012. the disputed amounts largely relate to transfer pricing matters. we firmly believe that the assessments are without merit and plan to pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve this matter. in december 2021, we filed a petition in the united states tax court challenging the notice. we intend to vigorously defend our position and we are confident in our ability to prevail on the merits. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from examinations such as this to determine the adequacy of our tax reserves. we believe that the final adjudication of this matter will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows and that we have adequate tax reserves for all tax matters. however, the ultimate outcome of disputes of this nature is uncertain, and if the irs were to prevail on all of its assertions, the assessed tax, penalties, and deficiency interest could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
various taxing authorities in the u.s. and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses.  companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations.  for u.s. federal, and in general for u.s. state tax returns, our fiscal 2007 and later tax returns remain effectively open for examination by the taxing authorities. we are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the u.s. and in various foreign jurisdictions. at this time, we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be. we record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law. if this threshold is not met, no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized. if the threshold is met, we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.
liquidity and capital resources we had $319.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at march 31, 2022, an increase of $37.4 million from the march 31, 2021 balance.
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $2.84 billion for fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher net income of $1.29 billion, adjusted for non-cash and non-operating charges of $1.52 billion and net cash inflows of $34.2 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. the primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities in fiscal 2022 include an increase in trade accounts receivable driven primarily by higher net sales and an increase in inventories related to increased production levels and higher costs of materials and production costs in support of customer demand for our products, offset by increases in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities driven by timing of payments to our suppliers, higher accrued employee compensation and sales related reserves. net cash provided by operating activities was $1.92 billion for fiscal 2021, primarily due to net income of $349.4 million, adjusted for non-cash and non-operating charges of $1.59 billion and net cash outflows of $27.0 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. the primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities in fiscal 2021 include an increase in trade accounts receivable and lower inventories related to improved business conditions in the second half of fiscal 2021 as businesses recovered from the effects of the covid-19 pandemic.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $477.7 million for fiscal 2022 compared to $173.3 million for fiscal 2021. fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 investing cash flows primarily related to capital purchases and investments in other assets.
our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions. capital expenditures were $370.1 million and $92.6 million in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment. towards the second half of fiscal 2021 we started to invest more significantly to expand manufacturing capacity in response to supply constraints relative to current demand levels and we expect this to continue through calendar 2022 and into calendar 2023. we currently intend to invest between $450 million and $550 million in equipment and facilities during the next twelve months. we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. we expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $2.33 billion for fiscal 2022 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1.86 billion for fiscal 2021. significant transactions affecting our net financing cash flows include:
•in fiscal 2022, $1.38 billion of cash used to pay down certain principal of our debt, including the cash portion of the settlement of our 2015 senior convertible debt, our 2017 senior convertible debt, and our 2017 junior convertible debt, our revolving credit facility and our 3.922% 2021 notes, partially funded by the issuance of our senior notes, and
•in fiscal 2021, $1.41 billion of cash used to pay down certain principal of our debt, including our revolving credit facility, term loan facility and bridge loan facility, and the cash portion of the settlement of our 2015 senior convertible debt, our 2017 senior convertible debt, and our 2017 junior convertible debt, partially funded by the issuance of our senior notes, and
•in fiscal 2022, we repurchased shares of our common stock for $425.6 million.
in december 2021, we amended and restated our credit agreement in its entirety. the amended and restated credit agreement provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility up to $2.75 billion that terminates on december 16, 2026. the credit agreement also permits us, subject to certain conditions, to add one or more incremental term loan facilities or increase the revolving loan commitments up to $750.0 million. as of march 31, 2022, the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was $7.84 billion. at march 31, 2022, we had $1.40 billion of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility compared to $2.35 billion at march 31, 2021. during fiscal 2021, we used borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from the issuance of our 0.972% 2024 notes to repay all amounts outstanding under our term loan facility.
capital returns in november 2021, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $4.00 billion of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. in fiscal 2022, we repurchased approximately 5.6 million shares of our common stock for $425.6 million under this authorization. we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in fiscal 2021. as of march 31, 2022, we held approximately 23.3 million shares as treasury shares. our current intent is to regularly repurchase shares of our common stock over time based on our cash generation, leverage metrics, and market conditions.
in october 2002, we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock.  to date, our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately $5.05 billion. cash dividends paid per share were $0.910 and $0.747 during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. total dividend payments amounted to $503.8 million and $388.3 million during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. a quarterly dividend of $0.276 per share was declared on may 9, 2022 and will be paid on june 3, 2022 to stockholders of record as of may 20, 2022. we expect the aggregate cash dividend for the june 2022 quarter to be approximately $153.2 million. our board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid, or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our board.  our current intent is to increase our quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions, our results of operations, and potential changes in tax laws.
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. our long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from working capital requirements, interest and principal repayments related to our outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures, cash dividends, share repurchases, and income tax payments. for additional information regarding our cash requirements see "note 11. commitments and contingencies", "note 10. leases", "note 6. debt" and "note 12. income taxes" of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. the semiconductor industry is capital intensive and in order to remain competitive, we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development.  we may increase our borrowings under our revolving credit facility or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities, for cash dividends, for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes.  the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors, including our level of dividend payments, changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash, demand for our products, changes in industry conditions, product mix, competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates.  we may from time to time seek to refinance certain of our outstanding notes or convertible debt through issuances of new notes or convertible debt, tender offers, exchange transactions or open market repurchases. such issuances, tender offers or exchanges or purchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our ability to negotiate acceptable terms, our liquidity position and other factors. there can be no assurance that any financing will be available on acceptable terms due to uncertainties resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, rising interest rates, higher inflation, economic uncertainty, or other factors, and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders.

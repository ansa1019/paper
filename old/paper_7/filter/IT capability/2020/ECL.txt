item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following management discussion and analysis ("md&a") provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. we provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and reportable segment level. we also provide quantitative information regarding special (gains) and charges, discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature. qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance.
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10-k. our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. this discussion contains various non-gaap financial measures and also contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. we refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled "non-gaap financial measures" at the end of this md&a, and "forward-looking statements" and "risk factors" within items 1 and 1a of this form 10-k. we also refer readers to the tables within the section entitled "results of operations" of this md&a for reconciliation information of non-gaap measures to u.s. gaap.
comparability of results championx transaction on june 3, 2020, we completed the previously announced separation of our upstream energy business (the "championx business") in a reverse morris trust transaction (the "transaction") through the split-off of championx holding inc. ("championx"), formed by ecolab as a wholly owned subsidiary to hold the championx business, followed immediately by the merger of championx (the "merger") with a wholly owned subsidiary of championx corporation (f/k/a apergy corporation, "apergy").
the championx business met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations because the separation of championx is a strategic shift in business that has a major effect on our operations and financial results. therefore, we report the historical results of championx, including the results of operations, cash flows, and related assets and liabilities, as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein. unless otherwise noted, the accompanying md&a has been revised to reflect the championx business as discontinued operations and prior year balances have been revised accordingly to reflect continuing operations only.
fixed currency foreign exchange rates management evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our non-u.s. dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates, which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations. fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into u.s. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management, with all periods presented using such rates. public currency rate data provided within the "segment performance" section of this md&a reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period and is provided for informational purposes only.
comparability of reportable segments effective in the first quarter of 2020, and in anticipation of the separation of the upstream energy business, we created the upstream and downstream operating segments from the global energy operating segment, which was also a reportable segment. subsequent to the separation of championx, we will no longer report the upstream energy segment, which previously held the championx business.
the downstream operating segment has been aggregated into the global industrial reportable segment. also, in the first quarter of 2020, we announced leadership changes which allow for shared oversight and focus on the healthcare and life sciences operating segments and established the global healthcare & life sciences reportable segment. this segment is comprised of the healthcare operating segment which was previously aggregated in the global institutional reportable segment and the life sciences operating segment which was previously aggregated in the global industrial reportable segment. additionally, the textile care operating segment, which is now being reported in other, had previously been aggregated in the global industrial reportable segment. we also renamed the global institutional reportable segment to the global institutional & specialty reportable segment. we made other immaterial changes, including the movement of certain customers and cost allocations between reportable segments.
impact of acquisitions and divestitures acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture and the venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods.
executive summary in 2020, we faced significant effects from the covid-19 pandemic. while the greater use of cleaning and sanitizing products benefited consolidated results and led to strong growth in the healthcare & life sciences segment, this was more than offset by reduced overall volumes in the institutional & specialty, industrial and other segments primarily due to lower levels of global economic activity resulting from mandated government restrictions implemented to control the pandemic spread. despite the range of actions we took to expand our sales and benefit our earnings through new products, programs, investments in the business and cost efficiency programs, as well as to position us for long term growth, the more substantial impact from the pandemic resulted in lower sales and a significant earnings decline for the full year.
sales reported sales decreased 6% to $11.8 billion in 2020 from $12.6 billion in 2019. when measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, fixed currency sales decreased 5% compared to the prior year. acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales decreased 7% compared to the prior year.
reported continuing operations diluted eps decreased 32% to $3.33 in 2020 compared to $4.87 in 2019. special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years. special (gains) and charges in 2020 were driven primarily by the impact of debt refinancing charges, restructuring charges, disposal and impairment charges, discrete tax items, acquisition and integration charges, charges for pay protection for certain employees impacted by covid-19 net of government subsidies and litigation and other charges. special (gains) and charges in 2019 were driven primarily by the impact of restructuring charges, discrete tax items, acquisition and integration charges and litigation and other charges. special (gains) and charges in 2018 were driven primarily by the impact of restructuring charges and our commitment to the ecolab foundation. adjusted continuing operations diluted eps, which exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items decreased 21% to $4.02 in 2020 compared to $5.12 in 2019.
balance sheet we remain committed to maintaining "a" range ratings metrics, supported by our current credit ratings of a-/baa1/a- by standard & poor's, moody's investor services and fitch, respectively. our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates.
net debt to ebitda our net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") was 2.4 and 2.3 for 2020 and 2019, respectively. we view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. see the "net debt to ebitda" table on page 45 for reconciliation information.
cash flow cash flow from continuing operations operating activities was $1.7 billion in 2020 compared to $2.0 billion in 2019. we continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in our business, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments.
dividends we increased our quarterly cash dividend 2% in december 2020, bringing annual dividends declared to $1.89 per share. the increase represents our 29th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 84th consecutive year we have paid cash dividends. our outstanding dividend history reflects our long term growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap. our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements ("notes").
preparation of our consolidated financial statements, in conformity with u.s. gaap, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.
in march 2020, coronavirus 2019 ("covid-19") was declared a pandemic ("pandemic") by the world health organization. as the impact of the pandemic continues to evolve, estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require judgment. these estimates and assumptions may change in future periods and will be recognized in the consolidated financial information as new events occur and additional information becomes known. to the extent actual results differ materially from those estimates and assumptions, our future financial statements could be affected.
besides estimates that meet the "critical" estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. all estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even from estimates not deemed critical. our critical accounting estimates include the following:
revenue recognition revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing service. revenue from product and sold equipment is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer of the product or delivery of the equipment. revenue from service and leased equipment is recognized when the services are provided, or the customer receives the benefit from the leased equipment, which is over time. service revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method and aligns with when the services are provided. typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date because the effort provided by the field selling and service organization represents services provided, which corresponds with the transfer of control. revenue for leased equipment is accounted for under topic 842 leases and recognized on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease contract.
our revenue policies do not provide for general rights of return. we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives based primarily on historical experience and anticipated performance over the contract period. depending on market conditions, we may increase customer incentive offerings, which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive. we also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits based on specific circumstances and credit conditions. we record an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on our estimates of expected future credit losses. for additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts, see discussion below.
the revenue standard can be applied to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics if it is reasonable that the effects of applying the standard at the portfolio would not be significantly different than applying the standard at the individual contract level. we apply the portfolio approach primarily within each operating segment by geographical region. application of the portfolio approach was focused on those characteristics that have the most significant accounting consequences in terms of their effect on the timing of revenue recognition or the amount of revenue recognized. we determined the key criteria to assess with respect to the portfolio approach, including the related deliverables, the characteristics of the customers and the timing and transfer of goods and services, which most closely aligned within the operating segments. in addition, the accountability for the business operations, as well as the operational decisions on how to go to market and the product offerings, are performed at the operating segment level. for additional information on revenue recognition, see note 18.
valuation allowances and accrued liabilities allowances for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are carried at the invoiced amounts, less an allowance for doubtful accounts, and generally do not bear interest. our allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our expectations of expected credit losses and is determined by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age and applying historical write-off and collection trend rates. our estimates separately consider macroeconomic trends and specific circumstances and credit conditions of customer receivables. account balances are written off against the allowance when it is determined the receivable will not be recovered.
our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $84 million and $56 million, as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. these amounts include our allowance for sales returns and credits of $16 million and $17 million as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. our bad debt expense as a percent of reported net sales was 0.5%, 0.2% and 0.1% in 2020, 2019, and 2018. our 2020 bad debt expense reflects a slight deterioration in the collectability of our credit portfolio due to the covid-19 pandemic. we believe that the covid-19 pandemic may continue to have an impact on future results consistent with 2020 experience. however, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, or if unexpected events, economic downturns, or significant changes in future trends were to occur, additional allowances may be required. for additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts, see note 2.
accrued liabilities our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations.
we record liabilities related to pending litigation, environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs. we record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses. expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain. while the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals, and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position. for additional information on our commitments and contingencies, see note 16.
actuarially determined liabilities pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans the measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries. these assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses.
the significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate, expected return on assets, projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table.
●   the discount rate assumptions for our u.s. plans are assessed using a yield curve constructed from a subset of bonds yielding greater than the median return from a population of non-callable, corporate bond issues that have an average rating of aa when averaging available moody's investor services, standard &amp; poor's and fitch ratings. the discount rate is calculated by matching the plans' projected cash flows to the bond yield curve. for 2020 and 2019, we measured service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows. we believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans' liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. in determining our u.s. pension obligations for 2020, our weighted-average discount rate decreased to 2.48% from 3.20% at year end 2019. in determining our u.s. postretirement health care obligation for 2020, our weighted-average discount rate decreased to 2.37% from 3.16% at year end 2019.
●   for postretirement benefit measurement purposes as of december 31, 2020, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed to be 8.00% for pre-65 costs and 10.75% for post-65 costs. the rates are assumed to decrease each year until they reach 5% in 2028 and remain at those levels thereafter.
●   in determining our u.s. pension and u.s. postretirement health care obligation for 2020, we utilized the most recent mortality table, mp-2020 projection scale (applied to the pri-2012 mortality table).
the effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of december 31, 2020, on the december 31, 2020 defined benefit obligation and 2021 expense is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant u.s. plans. expense amounts reflect the accounting for actuarial gains as a component of other comprehensive income and recognition of the impacts into income over the remaining service period:
effect on u.s. postretirement health care benefits plans increase in              higher assumption         recorded                 2021
our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans, with the majority of the amounts held in the u.k. and eurozone countries. we use assumptions similar to our u.s. plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations, however, the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information.
see note 17 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies, estimates, funded status, contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations.
self-insurance globally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses. we are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles, subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles. we are self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. we determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis.
restructuring our restructuring activities are associated with plans to enhance our efficiency, effectiveness and sharpen the competitiveness of our businesses. these restructuring plans include net costs associated with significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs and asset write-downs and disposals. employee termination costs are largely based on policies and severance plans, and include personnel reductions and related costs for severance, benefits and outplacement services. these charges are reflected in the quarter in which the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. contract termination costs include charges to terminate leases prior to the end of their respective terms and other contract termination costs. asset write-downs and disposals include leasehold improvement write-downs, other asset write-downs associated with combining operations and disposal of assets.
restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales and special (gains) and charges on the consolidated statement of income. amounts included as a component of cost of sales include supply chain related severance and other asset write-downs associated with combining operations. restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of both other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. our restructuring liability balance was $102 million and $103 million as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. for additional information on our restructuring activities, see note 3.
income taxes judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions.
on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") was enacted, which reduced the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. the tax act added many new provisions including changes to bonus depreciation, the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense, a tax on global intangible low taxed income ("gilti"), the base erosion anti abuse tax ("beat") and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income ("fdii"). we have elected the period cost method and included the gilti impact in our tax expense.
we recorded updates to the estimated discrete tax expense (benefit) of the one-time transition tax in 2018 and 2019 of $66 million and $(3.1) million, respectively, primarily due to the issuance of technical guidance in both years, the finalization of certain estimates as a result of filing the 2017 and 2018 u.s. federal tax returns and the finalization of the balance sheet positions used in the calculation of the transition tax. we have completed our accounting for the effects of the tax act as they relate to the repricing of deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax.
effective income tax rate our effective income tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions. we recognize the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances.
tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. as a result, the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns. some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense.
deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. based on the evaluation of available evidence, both positive and negative, we recognize tax assets, such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not. relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results, sources of future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes.
uncertain tax positions a number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. the number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. the internal revenue service ("irs") has completed its examinations of our u.s. federal income tax returns through 2016 and the years 2017 and 2018 are currently under audit. in addition to the u.s. federal examinations, we have ongoing audit activity in several u.s. state and foreign jurisdictions.
the tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal, state and international jurisdictions. we believe our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations, and our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken. because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations, we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits (including related interest and penalties) for amounts that do not meet the more-likely-than-not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance. the tax reserves are reviewed throughout the year, taking into account new legislation, regulations, case law and audit results. settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts, cash payments or receipts and/or adjustments to tax expense. tax reserves are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within other non-current liabilities. our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $21 million and $27 million as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. for additional information on income taxes see note 13.
long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill long-lived and amortizable intangible assets we review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $5.3 billion and $5.4 billion as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for impairment and when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the manner in which asset or asset groups are being used or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset or asset group. impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset's or assets group's carrying amount over its estimated fair value.
we use the straight-line method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets, including our customer relationships. we consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships, including projected sales data, customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships.
globally, we have a broad customer base. our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions, including the customer bases acquired from our nalco, anios and cid lines transactions, which made up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships. our historical retention rate, coupled with our consistent track record of keeping long-term relationships with our customers, supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer bases. if our customer retention rates or other post-acquisition operational activities change materially, we would evaluate the financial impact and any corresponding triggers which could result in impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets, or absent an impairment, an acceleration of amortization.
in addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. we have experienced no significant changes in the carrying amount or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets.
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets we had total goodwill of $6.0 billion and $5.6 billion as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter. our reporting units are aligned with our eleven operating segments.
for our annual 2020 goodwill impairment assessment, we completed a quantitative impairment assessment for each of our eleven reporting units using discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated assumptions regarding future growth rates, terminal values, and discount rates. our goodwill impairment assessments for 2020 indicated the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded the respective carrying amount of the reporting unit by a significant margin. we assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit may not be recoverable. additionally, no events noted during the second half of 2020 indicated a need to update any of our analyses or conclusions reached in the second quarter of 2020 for any of our eleven reporting units. there has been no impairment of goodwill in any of the periods presented.
the nalco trade name is our only indefinite life intangible asset. during the second quarter of 2020, we completed our annual impairment assessment of the nalco trade name using the relief from royalty discounted cash flow method, which incorporates assumptions regarding future sales projections, royalty rates and discount rates. based on this testing, the estimated fair value of the nalco trade name exceeded its carrying amount by a significant margin; therefore, no adjustment to the $1.2 billion carrying value of this asset was necessary. there has been no impairment of the nalco trade name intangible since it was acquired.
assets held for sale assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale and presented separately on the balance sheet when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (1) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the assets; (2) the assets are available for immediate sale, in their present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets; (3) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the assets have been initiated; (4) the sale of the assets is probable and is expected to be completed within one year; (5) the assets are being actively marketed for a price that is reasonable in relation to their current fair value; and (6) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or the plan will be withdrawn. the championx business met the criteria to be held for sale immediately prior to the separation. the championx business was previously recorded in the global energy reportable segment, which became the upstream energy reportable segment beginning in 2020 and subsequently has been reported in discontinued operations. the assets and liabilities held for sale are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current assets of discontinued operations, long-term assets of discontinued operations, current liabilities of discontinued operations and long-term liabilities of discontinued operations, respectively.
discontinued operations discontinued operations comprise those activities that were disposed of during the period or which were classified as held for sale at the end of a period and represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. the championx business met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations because it was a strategic shift in business that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. the championx business is presented on the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of income as discontinued operations. refer to note 5, discontinued operations, for additional information.

cost of sales ("cos") and gross profit margin ("gross margin")
our reported gross margin was 41.4%, 43.9%, and 43.7% for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. our 2020, 2019 and 2018 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special (gains) and charges of $48.2 million, $38.5 million, and $4.8 million, respectively. special (gains) and charges items impacting cos are shown within the "special (gains) and charges" table on page 35.
the decreased sg&a ratio (sg&a expenses as a percentage of reported net sales) comparing 2020 against 2019 was driven primarily by lower incentive compensation, discretionary spend reductions and cost savings initiatives which offset the effects of lower sales. the decreased sg&a ratio comparing 2019 against 2018 was driven primarily by sales leverage, restructuring efforts and cost savings, which more than offset investments in the business special (gains) and charges special (gains) and charges reported on the consolidated statement of income included the following items:

for segment reporting purposes, special (gains) and charges are not allocated to reportable segments, which is consistent with our internal management reporting.
restructuring activities restructuring activities are primarily related to the institutional advancement program and accelerate 2020, both of which are described below. these activities have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges, and other (income) expense on the consolidated statement of income. restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
institutional advancement program during 2020, we approved a restructuring plan focused on the institutional business ("the institutional plan") which is intended to enhance our institutional sales and service structure and allow the sales team to capture share and penetration while maximizing service effectiveness by leveraging our ongoing investments in digital technology. in february 2021, we expanded the institutional plan, and expect that these restructuring charges will be completed by 2023, with total anticipated costs of $80 million ($60 million after tax) or $0.21 per diluted share. the costs are expected to be primarily cash expenditures for severance and facility closures. we also anticipate non-cash charges related to equipment disposals. we expect total program savings of approximately $50 million by the end of 2024. actual costs may vary from these estimates depending on actions taken.

comparability of cash generated from operating activities across 2020 to 2018 was impacted by fluctuations in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable ("working capital"), the combination of which increased $32 million, $128 million and $133 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively. the 2020 cash flow impact from working capital accounts was driven by lower sales volume, partially offset by lower inventory turnover and slower accounts receivable collection.
the impact on operating cash flows of pension and postretirement plan contributions, cash activity related to restructuring, cash paid for income taxes and cash paid for interest, are shown in the following table:
investing activities
cash used for investing activities           ($857.7)               ($1,129.6)               ($961.9)                $271.9                  ($167.7)
cash used for investing activities is primarily impacted by the timing of business acquisitions and dispositions as well as from capital investments in the business.
total cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired and net of cash received from dispositions, in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $371 million, $385 million and $221 million, respectively. our acquisitions and divestitures are discussed further in note 4. we continue to target strategic business acquisitions which complement our growth strategy and expect to continue to make capital investments and acquisitions in the future to support our long-term growth.
we continue to make capital investments in the business, including merchandising and customer equipment and manufacturing facilities. total capital expenditures were $489 million, $731 million and $779 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
financing activities
cash provided by (used for) financing activities           ($340.2)               ($1,346.6)               ($1,171.4)                $1,006.4                  ($175.2)
our cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the issuances and repayment of debt, common stock repurchases, proceeds from common stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs, dividend payments and acquisition-related contingent considerations.
shares are repurchased for the purpose of partially offsetting the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans and stock issued in acquisitions, to manage our capital structure and to efficiently return capital to shareholders. we repurchased a total of $146 million, $354 million, and $562 million of shares in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
liquidity and capital resources we currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for the next twelve months, including scheduled debt repayments, new investments in the business, share repurchases, dividend payments, possible business acquisitions and pension and postretirement contributions with cash on hand, cash generated from operating activities, and as needed, additional short-term and/or long-term borrowings. we continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong.
as of december 31, 2020, we had $1,260 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $59 million was held outside of the u.s. as of december 31, 2019, we had $119 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $91 million was held outside of the u.s. we have increased our available cash on hand during the year to meet current and any future potential operational cash needs as a result of covid-19 pandemic. we will continue to evaluate our cash position in light of future developments.
as of december 31, 2020, we had a $2.0 billion multi-year credit facility, which expires in november 2022. the credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks and supports our u.s. and euro commercial paper programs. the maximum aggregate amount of commercial paper that may be issued under our u.s. commercial paper program and our euro commercial paper program may not exceed $2.0 billion. at year end, we had no outstanding commercial paper under our euro or u.s. program. there were no borrowings under our credit facility as of december 31, 2020 or 2019. as of december 31, 2020, both programs were rated a-2 by standard & poor's, p-2 by moody's and f-1 by fitch.
as of december 31, 2020, we have a $500 million 364-day revolving credit agreement, which expires in april 2021. the revolving credit agreement is to be used for general corporate purposes with a diverse syndicate of banks to provide for further liquidity in response to the coronavirus pandemic. there were no borrowings under this revolving credit agreement as of december 31, 2020. in addition, we executed a $305 million term credit agreement in april 2020, which we drew on and repaid $303 million during the second quarter of 2020.
additionally, we have uncommitted credit lines with major international banks and financial institutions. these credit lines support our daily global funding needs, primarily our global cash pooling structures. we have $123 million of bank supported letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees outstanding in support of our commercial business transactions. we do not have any other significant unconditional purchase obligations or commercial commitments.
as of december 31, 2020, standard & poor's and fitch both rated our long-term credit at a- (stable outlook) and moody's rated our long-term credit at baa1 (positive outlook). a reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or negotiate new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities.
we are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures.
one-time transition tax       103                13                      -              50                  40
as of december 31, 2020, our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $21 million. we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required. therefore, these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.
we do not have required minimum cash contribution obligations for our qualified pension plans in 2020. we are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements. we estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate $47 million in 2020. these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.
we lease certain sales and administrative office facilities, distribution centers, research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longer-term operating leases. vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration. vehicle leases have residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. through the normal course of business, we have established various joint ventures, some of which have not been consolidated within our financial statements as we neither control, nor are the primary beneficiary. the joint ventures help us meet local ownership requirements, achieve quicker operational scale, expand our ability to provide customers a more fully integrated offering or provide other benefits to our business or customers. these entities have not been utilized as special purposes entities, which are sometimes established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. as such, we are not exposed to financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.
market risk we enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing monitoring and reporting, and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows.
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements, and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than u.s. dollars. we use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. as of december 31, 2020, we had a total of €1,150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges.
see note 9 for further information on our hedging activity.
based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10% change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increase/decrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately $213 million. the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.
global economic and political environment coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19)
in march 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) was declared a pandemic by the world health organization. the covid-19 pandemic affected global economies and financial markets throughout 2020, and industries faced challenges from restricted economic conditions resulting from government and private efforts to address the pandemic. as the pandemic continued and new variants of covid-19 were identified, most countries required companies to limit or suspend business operations and implemented travel restrictions. these conditions had and are expected to continue to have a negative impact on market conditions and customer demand throughout the world over the foreseeable future until the pandemic diminishes. we experienced, and anticipate continued, overall adverse impacts and disruptions in our restaurant, hospitality and entertainment-related business operations, with modest impact on our industrial segment businesses and limited or no adverse impacts on certain other parts of our business, supply chain and business continuity plans from covid-19 restrictions; in addition, certain of our business have and will continue to benefit from increased cleaning and sanitizing product demand.
while we anticipate our 2021 results of operations to be generally comparable to 2019, we are not yet able to adequately estimate the full impact of the coronavirus outbreak on our end markets and our business due to the pandemic's evolving nature and the public and private responses to it. while we expect favorable conditions to resume in our industrial markets, and expect conditions to continue to be favorable in our healthcare and life sciences markets, we anticipate products and services provided to the full-service restaurant, hospitality, lodging and entertainment industries will continue to be negatively impacted over the near term due to the regulatory and organizational operating restrictions and mandates that have been put in place and affecting those end markets. we have taken, and are continuing to take, steps to drive revenue growth through new products, programs and markets, as well as steps to reduce costs, including reductions in capital expenditures, as well as other ongoing cost initiatives.
the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security (cares) act was signed into law on march 27, 2020. we have taken advantage of the employer payroll tax (fica) deferral offered by the cares act, which allowed us to defer the payment of employer payroll taxes for the period from march 27, 2020 to december 31, 2020. the deferred fica liability was $66.4 million and will be payable in equal installments at december 2021 and december 2022.
global economies almost half of our sales are outside of the united states. our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results.
argentina has continued to experience negative economic trends, evidenced by multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the argentine peso, and increasing borrowing rates. argentina is classified as a highly inflationary economy in accordance with u.s. gaap, and the u.s. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in argentina. during 2020, sales in argentina represented less than 1% of our consolidated sales. assets held in argentina at the end of 2020 represented less than 1% of our consolidated assets.
brexit referendum december 31, 2020 marked the end of the brexit transition period and with it the uk's departure from the european union (eu) customs union and single market. the eu and uk arrived at a trade and cooperation agreement, (tca) allowing companies to trade tariff free on products having eu origins. we are working through the details of this tca impact with the expectation that much of our trade will in fact be free of tariff.
subsequent events subsequent to year end, we separately acquired european institutional and healthcare businesses. the aggregate purchase consideration for these two acquisitions was approximately $100 million. the acquisitions are not material to our consolidated financial statements individually or in the aggregate.
non-gaap financial measures this md&a includes financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap. these non-gaap measures include:
●  acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales
●  acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income
●  acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin
●  ebitda
●  adjusted diluted eps from continuing operations we provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. we use these non-gaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.
our non-gaap financial measures for cost of sales, gross margin, interest expense and operating income exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, and our non-gaap measures for tax rate, net income from continuing operations attributable to ecolab and diluted eps from continuing operations further exclude the impact of discrete tax items. we include items within special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items that we believe can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results. after tax special (gains) and charges are derived by applying the applicable local jurisdictional tax rate to the corresponding pre-tax special (gains) and charges.
ebitda is defined as the sum of net income including non-controlling interest, provision for income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization. ebitda is used in our net debt to ebitda ratio, which we view as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization.
acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture and the venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods.
these non-gaap measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to u.s. gaap, and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. we recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the u.s. gaap measures included in this md&a and we have provided reconciliations of reported u.s. gaap amounts to the non-gaap amounts.

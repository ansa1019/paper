item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
introduction and overview the following management's discussion and analysis ("md&a"), should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements ("financial statements") in item 8 and the forward-looking statements and the risk factors set forth in item 1a.  all note references herein refer to the notes to the financial statements. tabular amounts are displayed in millions of u.s. dollars except per share and unit count amounts, or as otherwise specifically identified. percentages may not recompute due to rounding.
yum! brands, inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as the "company", "yum", "we", "us" or "our") franchise or operate a system of over 50,000 restaurants in more than 150 countries and territories, primarily under the concepts of kfc, pizza hut, taco bell and the habit burger grill (collectively, the "concepts"). the company's kfc, pizza hut and taco bell brands are global leaders of the chicken, pizza and mexican-style food categories, respectively.  the habit burger grill, a concept we acquired on march 18, 2020, is a fast-casual restaurant concept specializing in made-to-order chargrilled burgers, sandwiches and more. of the over 50,000 restaurants, 98% are operated by franchisees.
•the kfc division which includes our worldwide operations of the kfc concept
•the pizza hut division which includes our worldwide operations of the pizza hut concept
•the taco bell division which includes our worldwide operations of the taco bell concept
•the habit burger grill division which includes our worldwide operations of the habit burger grill concept through our recipe for growth and good we intend to unlock the growth potential of our concepts and yum, drive increased collaboration across our concepts and geographies and consistently deliver better customer experiences, improved unit economics and higher rates of growth. key enablers include accelerated use of technology and better leverage of our systemwide scale.
our recipe for growth is based on four key drivers:
•unrivaled culture and talent: leverage our culture and people capability to fuel brand performance and franchise success
•unmatched operating capability: recruit and equip the best restaurant operators in the world to deliver great customer experiences
•bold restaurant development: drive market and franchise expansion with strong economics and value our global citizenship and sustainability strategy, called the recipe for good, reflects our priorities for socially responsible growth, risk management and sustainable stewardship of our people, food and planet.
on october 11, 2016, yum announced our transformation plans to drive global expansion of our kfc, pizza hut and taco bell brands ("yum's strategic transformation initiatives") following the spin-off of our china business into an independent publicly-traded company under the name of yum china holdings, inc. ("yum china").   at this time, we established transformation goals to be met by the end of 2019 including becoming:
•more focused.   by focusing on four growth drivers similar to those that make up our recipe for growth above we accelerated system sales growth to 8% in 2019 (excluding the impacts of the 53rd week and foreign currency translation).
•more efficient. the company revamped its financial profile, improving the efficiency of its organization and cost structure globally, by:
•reducing annual capital expenditures associated with company-operated restaurant maintenance and other projects and funded additional capital for new company units through the refranchising of existing company units.  capital spending in 2019 net of refranchising proceeds was $86 million.
•maintaining an optimized capital structure of ~5.0x earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") net leverage.
from 2017 through 2019, we returned $6.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends. we funded these shareholder returns through a combination of refranchising proceeds, free cash flow generation and maintenance of our ~5.0x ebitda consolidated net leverage. we generated pre-tax proceeds of $2.8 billion through our refranchising initiatives to achieve targeted franchise ownership of 98%. refer to the liquidity and capital resources section of this md&a for additional details.
as a result of the impacts on our business due to the covid-19 pandemic, certain measures we established as part of our transformation goals were negatively impacted in 2020. for the full year 2020, g&a, excluding the impact of special items, represented 1.9% of consolidated system sales, primarily due to sales pressures resulting from the covid-19 pandemic. while we took certain austerity measures to reduce g&a spending such as lower travel related costs and a reduction of our chief executive officer's salary, these reductions were offset by accelerated digital and technology spending to enhance our customer experience and off-premise capabilities. we expect our g&a as a percentage of consolidated system sales to move back toward our historical target of 1.7% as sustained growth resumes. additionally, during 2020 our ebitda was negatively impacted by the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, which increased our consolidated leverage, net of available cash. we currently estimate we will grow back into our ~5.0x ebitda consolidated net leverage by second quarter 2021.
going forward, we expect to:
•maintain a capital structure of ~5.0x ebitda consolidated net leverage;
•invest capital in a manner consistent with an asset light, franchisor model; and
•allocate g&a in an efficient manner that provides leverage to operating profit growth while at the same time opportunistically investing in strategic growth initiatives.
we intend for this md&a to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our results of operations, including performance metrics that management uses to assess the company's performance. throughout this md&a, we commonly discuss the following performance metrics:
•same-store sales growth is the estimated percentage change in system sales of all restaurants that have been open and in the yum system for one year or more, including those temporarily closed. from time-to-time restaurants may be temporarily closed due to remodeling or image enhancement, rebuilding, natural disasters, health epidemic or pandemic, landlord disputes or other issues. throughout 2020 we had a significant number of restaurants that were temporarily closed, including restaurants closed due to government and landlord restrictions, as a result of covid-19. the system sales of restaurants we deem temporarily closed remain in our base for purposes of determining same-store sales growth and the restaurants remain in our unit count (see below). we believe same-store sales growth is useful to investors because our results are heavily dependent on the results of our concepts' existing store base. additionally, same-store sales growth is reflective of the strength of our brands, the effectiveness of our operational and advertising initiatives and local economic and consumer trends. in 2020, when calculating same-store sales growth we also included in our prior year base the sales of stores that were added as a result of our acquisition of the habit restaurants, inc. on march 18, 2020, and that were open for one year or more. in 2019, when calculating same-store sales growth we also included in our prior year base the sales of stores that were added as a result of the telepizza strategic alliance in december 2018 and that were open for one year or more. see additional discussion of the acquisition of the habit restaurants, inc. and telepizza strategic alliance within this md&a.
•net new unit growth reflects new unit openings offset by permanent store closures, by us and our franchisees. to determine whether a restaurant meets the definition of a unit we consider whether the restaurant has operations that are ongoing and independent from another yum unit, serves the primary product of one of our concepts, operates under a separate franchise agreement (if operated by a franchisee) and has substantial and sustainable sales. we believe net new unit growth is useful to investors because we depend on net new units for a significant portion of our growth. additionally, net new unit growth is generally reflective of the economic returns to us and our franchisees from opening and operating our concept restaurants.
•system sales, system sales excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation ("fx"), and system sales excluding fx and the impact of the 53rd week in 2019 for our u.s. subsidiaries and certain international subsidiaries that operate on a weekly period calendar. system sales reflect the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including company-
owned and franchise restaurants. sales at franchise restaurants typically generate ongoing franchise and license fees for the company at a rate of 3% to 6% of sales. increasingly, customers are paying a fee to a third party to deliver or facilitate the ordering of our concepts' products. we also include in system sales any portion of the amount customers pay these third parties for which the third party is obligated to pay us a license fee as a percentage of such amount. franchise restaurant sales and fees paid by customers to third parties to deliver or facilitate the ordering of our concepts' products are not included in company sales on the consolidated statements of income; however, any resulting franchise and license fees we receive are included in the company's revenues. we believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates our primary revenue drivers, company and franchise same-store sales as well as net unit growth.
•company restaurant profit ("restaurant profit") is defined as company sales less expenses incurred directly by our company-owned restaurants in generating company sales. company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales is defined as restaurant profit divided by company sales. restaurant profit is useful to investors as it provides a measure of profitability for our company-owned restaurants.
in addition to the results provided in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america ("gaap"), the company provides the following non-gaap measurements.
•diluted earnings per share excluding special items (as defined below);
•effective tax rate excluding special items;
•core operating profit and core operating profit excluding the impact of the 53rd week in 2019. core operating profit excludes special items and fx and we use core operating profit for the purposes of evaluating performance internally.
these non-gaap measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with gaap. rather, the company believes that the presentation of these non-gaap measurements provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
special items are not included in any of our division segment results as the company does not believe they are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature. our chief operating decision maker does not consider the impact of special items when assessing segment performance.
certain performance metrics and non-gaap measurements are presented excluding the impact of fx. these amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. we believe the elimination of the fx impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations.
for 2019 we provided core operating profit excluding the impact of the 53rd week and system sales excluding fx and the impact of the 53rd week to further enhance the comparability given the 53rd week that was part of our fiscal calendar in 2019.
results of operations summary all comparisons within this summary are versus the same period a year ago and unless otherwise stated include the impact of a 53rd week in 2019.  for discussion of our results of operations for 2019 compared to 2018, refer to the management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in part ii, item 7 of our form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019, filed with the sec on february 19, 2020.
for 2020, gaap diluted eps decreased 29% to $2.94 per share, and diluted eps, excluding special items, increased 2% to $3.62 per share.

additionally:
•during the year, net units increased by 183 units (including our acquisition of the habit burger grill in the first quarter of 2020).
•during the year, we recognized pre-tax investment income of $69 million related to the change in fair value of our investment in grubhub, inc. common stock that we sold in the third quarter of 2020, which added $0.17 to diluted eps for the year. when coupled with $77 million of pre-tax investment expense in 2019, which resulted in a negative $0.19 impact to diluted eps, our grubhub investment favorably impacted year-over-year diluted eps growth by $0.36.
•foreign currency translation impacted divisional operating profit unfavorably for the year by $9 million.

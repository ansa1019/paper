2020 marked the company's 23rd consecutive year of increased revenues. revenues for the year rose 7.2 percent to $2.161 billion compared to $2.015 billion for the prior year. income before income taxes increased 35.8% to $354.7 million compared to $261.2 million the prior year. net income increased 28.3% to $260.8 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.53 compared to $203.3 million, or $0.41 per diluted share for the prior year. the drop in net income from 2018 to 2019 was primarily attributed to the pension settlement loss recorded in 2019.
covid-19 pandemic impact as the pandemic challenges grew early in 2020, the company made numerous operational adjustments to address the economic, health and safety challenges from the covid-19 pandemic. these included new covid-related procedures, modified customer service and related protocols, daily health screenings before entering shared offices, and a transition to remote work locations to reduce concentrations of personnel in offices where appropriate. cost containment efforts included furloughs, layoffs, elimination of non-essential travel, postponing capital expenditures, and temporary salary reductions for upper management, among other actions.
customer retention during the pandemic is less predictable, and of greater immediate concern compared with our normal operations, however, our residential pest and termite control business has remained reasonably consistent with some growth over prior years. with many sheltering or working from home, we have experienced higher than normal demand for our residential services. our commercial pest control business has been more adversely impacted, as it crosses multiple industries such as healthcare, food processing, logistics, grocery, retail and hospitality. each of these industries is being impacted differently by the pandemic. many of our commercial customers continue to operate as "essential" businesses; however, unfortunately there are a notable number of others that have closed, at least temporarily. we expect this impact will persist through much of 2021 until the majority of the population has been vaccinated against the virus. the company's residential and termite revenues grew 13.4% and 9.6%, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019 while our commercial pest control revenues fell by 0.5%.
while we have a substantial amount of intangible assets on our balance sheet, based on our revenue growth this year, we do not anticipate any significant long-term loss in revenues or cash flows that would approach a level for impairment of intangible assets.
all of our critical supply-chain vendors have remained operational, and we have engaged additional new sources to supplement our existing suppliers, especially for critical ppe and other covid-19 related items. fleet suppliers and support vendors continue to serve our needs.
overview the company's revenues increased to $2.161 billion in 2020, a 7.2% increase compared to 2019. gross margin increased to 51.5% for 2020 from 50.7% in 2019. sales, general and administrative expense were 30.4% of revenues in 2020 compared to 30.9% in 2019. the company's depreciation and amortization expense as a percent of revenue increased 2.5% to 4.1% in 2020 compared to 4.0% in 2019. rollins' net income of $260.8 million in 2020 was an increase of $57.5 million, or 28.3%, compared to $203.3 million in 2019. net profit margin improved to 12.1% in 2020 from 10.1% in 2019. rollins continued to expand our global brand recognition with acquisitions in the united states, canada, united kingdom, australia, and asia as well as expanded our orkin international franchise program in numerous countries around the globe. the company continues to seek new international opportunities.
revenues revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020 were $2.161 billion, an increase of $145.7 million, or 7.2%, from 2019 revenues of $2.015 billion. growth accounted for approximately 3.8% of our increase, and our acquisitions contributed the remaining revenue growth. we experienced strong growth in residential pest control, increasing 13.4%, while termite and ancillary revenues grew 9.6%. year over year commercial revenues were down 0.5% as commercial pest control was negatively impacted by the covid-19 virus due to various levels of government-driven shutdowns. the company's revenue mix for the year ended december 31, 2020 consisted primarily of 45% residential pest control, 36% commercial pest control and 19% termite and ancillary revenues (such as moisture control, insulation, deck and gutter work).
during 2020, the company chose to forgo the normal mid-year price increase, which historically contributes approximately 1.0% to our annual revenue growth. approximately 80% of the company's pest control revenue was recurring in 2020, as well as in 2019.
the company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 7% and 8% of total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the company established new franchises in several international countries around the globe in 2020 while closing or acquiring others, for a total of 94 orkin international franchises and nine australia franchises at december 31, 2020, compared to 97 orkin international franchises, one canadian critter control franchises and ten australia franchises at december 31, 2019. the australia franchises operate under the murray pest control and scientific pest management names.
revenue from franchising was up 5.6% in 2020 compared to 2019 as the company continued to expand orkin's international footprint and recognition of initial franchise fees. international and domestic franchising revenue was less than 1% of the company's revenues for 2020. orkin had 143 and 147 franchises (domestic and international) at december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the company continued its strategy of buying back critter control franchises during 2020, resulting in a drop in franchises to 79 at december 31, 2020, compared to 85 at december 31, 2019.
cost of services provided for the twelve months ended december 31, 2020, cost of services provided increased $55.0 million, or 5.5%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2019. gross margin for the year increased to 51.5% for 2020 from 50.7% in 2019. margin improvements were driven primarily from lower service wage growth compared to revenue growth, and from fleet savings driven by improvements in our routing and scheduling efficiencies and lower fuel prices.
depreciation and amortization for the twelve months ended december 31, 2020, depreciation and amortization increased $7.2 million, or 8.9%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2019. the dollar increase was primarily due to depreciation increasing $4.0 million, or 10.9%, from the depreciation of acquired and purchased assets and depreciation from various it related projects. amortization of intangible assets increased $3.2 million, or 7.3%, for 2020 due to the additional amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions over the last year, including a full year of amortization for clark pest control acquired in april 2019, as well as several smaller foreign and domestic companies.
sales, general and administrative for the twelve months ended december 31, 2020, sales, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses increased $32.8 million, or 5.3%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2019. sg&a decreased to 30.4% of revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to 30.9% in 2019. the company eliminated any non-essential spending at the start of the pandemic which lowered expenses in several areas. travel restrictions reduced typical training, site visits and conference costs. conversely, we incurred higher than normal expenses in 2019 related to acquisition preparation and integration activities for clark pest control.
gain / loss on sales of assets, net the company recorded a $1.6 million net loss on sales of assets for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to a net gain on sales of assets of $0.6 million in 2019. the company's 2020 losses came primarily from liquidating the pension plan assets from the 2019 pension plan settlement. during 2019, the company recorded gains from the sale of owned vehicles and other owned property.
interest expense, net interest expense, net for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 was $5.1 million and $6.9 million respectively, driven largely by borrowings to fund acquisitions, among other things.
taxes the company's effective tax rate increased to 26.5% in 2020 compared to 22.1% in 2019, due primarily to state and foreign income tax changes and limited tax deductibility for the accelerated stock vesting expense recognized in 2020. the 2019 rate was lower due to beneficial adjustments related to the 2019 pension settlement.
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash flow cash from operating activities is the principal source of cash generation for our businesses.
the most significant source of cash in rollins' cash flow from operations is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from services sold. the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services.

the company has one remaining pension in one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. an employer contribution of $0.1 million was made during the year ended december 31, 2019. no contributions were made during 2020 or 2018. while the company's management does not expect to make a contribution to its remaining pension plan during fiscal year 2021, additional plan contributions, if any, will not have a material effect on the company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
cash used in investing activities the company used $162.4 million in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to $455.1 million and $101.4 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively. the company invested approximately $23.2 million in capital expenditures during 2020 compared to $27.1 million and $27.2 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively. capital expenditures for the year consisted primarily of property purchases, equipment replacements and technology-related projects. the company expects to invest between $25.0 million and $30.0 million in 2021 in capital expenditures. during 2020, the company and its subsidiaries acquired mccall pest management, inc, the remaining clark pest control locations, and adam's pest control in australia as well as several other small to mid-sized companies for a total of $147.6 million compared to $430.6 million and $76.8 million in acquisitions during 2019 and 2018, respectively. the expenditures for the company's acquisitions were funded through existing cash balances, borrowings on our line of credit, a term loan, and other operating cash flows. the company continues to seek new acquisitions.

the company's international business is expanding, and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. repatriation of cash from the company's foreign subsidiaries is not a part of the company's current business plan.

critical accounting policies and estimates the company views critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require management's most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows:
accrual for termite contracts-the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. factors that may impact future costs include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company's business practices. however, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims. accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the company's consolidated statements of financial position.
accrued insurance-the company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers' compensation and auto liability. risks are managed through either high deductible insurance or a non-affiliated group captive insurance member arrangement. the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. the company contracts with an independent third-party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management's knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. management's judgment is inherently subjective as a number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. the company continues to be proactive in safety and risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce and prevent claims. initiatives that have been implemented include required pre-employment screening and ongoing motor vehicle record review for all drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, pre-hire, random and post incident drug testing, increased driver training and post-injury nurse triage for work-related injuries. the   accruals and reserves we hold are based on estimates that involve a degree of judgment and are inherently variable and could be overestimated or insufficient. if actual claims exceed our estimates, our operating results could be materially affected, and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited.
revenue recognition- the company's revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, each of which are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. revenue is recognized net of allowances for refunds and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
more on the company's revenue recognition policy can be found in the company's notes to the consolidated financial statements, note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies with the heading revenue recognition.
contingency accruals-the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. in accordance with the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 450 "contingencies," management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation. estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. however, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company's financial condition or results of operations. contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the company's consolidated statements of financial position.
recent accounting guidance see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion.

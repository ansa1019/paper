•   asset managers (institutional funds and accounts, mutual funds, hedge funds, etfs, insurance products, private banks and real estate investment trusts)
as of december 31, 2020, we had offices in more than 30 cities across more than 20 countries to help serve our diverse client base, with 46.9% of our revenues coming from clients in the americas, 37.0% in europe, the middle east and africa ("emea") and 16.1% in asia and australia.
in evaluating our financial performance, we focus on revenue and profit growth, including results accounted for under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap") as well as non-gaap measures, for the company as a whole and by operating segment. in addition, we focus on operating metrics, including run rate, subscription sales and retention rate, to manage the business. our business is not highly capital intensive and, as such, we expect to continue to convert a high percentage of our profits into excess cash in the future. our growth strategy includes: (a) extending leadership in research-enhanced content across asset classes, (b) enhancing distribution and content-enabling technology, (c) expanding solutions that empower client customization, (d) strengthening existing client relationships and growing by developing new ones and (e) executing strategic relationships and acquisitions with complementary content and technology companies.
key financial metrics and drivers as discussed in the previous section, we utilize a portfolio of key financial metrics to manage the company, including gaap and non-gaap measures. as detailed below, we review revenues by type and by segment, or by major product line. we also review expenses by activity, which provides more transparency into how resources are being deployed. in addition, we utilize operating metrics including run rate, subscription sales and retention rate to analyze past performance and to provide insight into our latest reported recurring business.
in the discussion that follows, we provide certain variances excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reflect the difference between the current period results as reported compared to the current period results recalculated using the foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the comparable prior period. while operating revenues adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations includes asset-based fees that have been adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the underlying aum, which is the primary component of asset-based fees, is not adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations. more than three-fifths of the aum are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, and accordingly, any such impact is excluded from the disclosed foreign currency-adjusted variances.
revenues our revenues are characterized by type, which broadly reflects the nature of how they are recognized or earned. our revenue types are recurring subscriptions, asset-based fees and non-recurring revenues. we also group our revenues by segment and provide the revenue type within each segment.
operating expenses we group our operating expenses into the following activity categories:
costs are assigned to these activity categories based on the nature of the expense or, when not directly attributable, an estimated allocation based on the type of effort involved.
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist of costs associated with acquiring new clients or selling new products or product renewals to existing clients and primarily includes the costs of our sales and marketing teams, as well as costs incurred in other groups associated with acquiring new business, including product management, research, technology and sales operations.
research and development r&d expenses consist of costs to develop new or enhance existing products and costs to develop new or improved technology and service platforms for the delivery of our products and services and primarily include the costs of development, research, product management, project management and the technology support associated with these efforts.
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets expense relates to definite-lived intangible assets arising from past acquisitions and internal capitalized software projects. intangibles arising from past acquisitions consist of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, technology and software, proprietary processes and data and non-competition agreements. we amortize definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. definite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when impairment indicators are present, and, if impaired, written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. we have no indefinite-lived intangible assets.
depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements this category consists of expenses related to depreciating or amortizing the cost of furniture and fixtures, computer and related equipment and leasehold improvements over the estimated useful life of the assets.
other expense (income), net this category consists primarily of interest we pay on our outstanding indebtedness, interest we collect on cash and short-term investments, foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses as well as other non-operating income and expense items, such as losses on early extinguishment of debt and income and losses associated with our equity method investment.
non-gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda
"adjusted ebitda," a non-gaap measure used by management to assess operating performance, is defined as net income before (1) provision for income taxes, (2) other expense (income), net, (3) depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, (4) amortization of intangible assets and, at times, (5) certain other transactions or adjustments, including the impact related to the vesting of multi-year restricted stock units granted in 2016 to certain senior executives that are subject to the achievement of multi-year total shareholder return targets, which are performance targets with a market condition (the "2016 multi-year psus").
"adjusted ebitda expenses," a non-gaap measure used by management to assess operating performance, is defined as operating expenses less depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets and, at times, certain other transactions or adjustments, including the impact related to the vesting of the 2016 multi-year psus.
adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses are believed to be meaningful measures of the operating performance of the company because they adjust for significant one-time, unusual or non-recurring items as well as eliminate the accounting effects of certain capital spending and acquisitions that do not directly affect what management considers to be the company's ongoing operating performance in the period. all companies do not calculate adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses in the same way. these measures can differ significantly from company to company depending on, among other things, long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. accordingly, the company's computation of the adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda expenses measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures computed by other companies.
run rate run rate is a key operating metric and is important because an increase or decrease in our run rate ultimately impacts our operating revenues over time. at the end of any period, we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of total revenues for the following 12 months. we measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as "run rate." see "-operating metrics-run rate" below for additional information on the calculation of this metric.
subscription sales subscription sales is a key operating metric and is important because new subscription sales increase our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues over time. see "-operating metrics- sales" below for additional information.
retention rate another key operating metric is retention rate which is important because subscription cancellations decrease our run rate and ultimately our operating revenues over time. see "-operating metrics-retention rate" below for additional information on the calculation of this metric.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap. these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. we believe the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time these estimates and judgments are made. to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. see note 1, "introduction and basis of presentation-significant accounting policies," and note 2, "recent accounting standards updates," of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for a listing of our accounting policies.
factors affecting the comparability of results share repurchases the board of directors has approved a stock repurchase program for the purchase of the company's common stock. see note 10, "shareholders' equity (deficit)," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our stock repurchase program.
the weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate our diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2020 decreased by 1.2% compared to the year ended december 31, 2019. the decrease primarily reflects the impact of share repurchases made pursuant to the stock repurchase program and the vesting of the restricted stock units that were included in the dilutive share count in the prior year.
senior notes we have an aggregate $3,400.0 million of senior notes outstanding as of december 31, 2020. see "-liquidity and capital resources-senior notes and credit agreement" below and note 5, "commitments and contingencies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our senior notes and revolving credit agreement.
tax reform which was enacted on december 22, 2017, significantly revised the u.s. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering u.s. corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time tax on deemed repatriation of historic earnings of foreign subsidiaries (the "toll charge").
revenues from asset-based fees increased 10.5% to $399.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to $361.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase in asset-based fees was driven by growth in revenues from all of our indexed investment product categories, including an increase in revenues from exchange traded futures and options contracts linked to msci indexes that were primarily driven by price increases. the increase in revenues from asset-based fees was also driven by higher revenues from non-etf indexed funds linked to msci indexes, which was driven by price increases and an increase in average aum. revenues from etfs linked to msci indexes also increased, driven by an 8.9% increase in average aum in equity etfs linked to msci indexes, partially offset by lower fees resulting from the impact of a change in product mix. the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues from asset-based fees was negligible.
the following table presents the value of aum in equity etfs linked to msci indexes and the sequential change of such assets as of the end of each of the periods indicated:

(1)   the historical values of the aum in equity etfs linked to our indexes as of the last day of the month and the monthly average balance can be found under the link "aum in equity etfs linked to msci indexes" on our investor relations homepage at http://ir.msci.com. this information is updated mid-month each month. information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10-k or any other report filed with the sec. the aum in equity etfs also includes aum in exchange traded notes, the value of which is less than 1.0% of the aum amounts presented.
(2)   the values for periods prior to april 26, 2019 were based on data from bloomberg and msci, while the values for periods on or after april 26, 2019 were based on data from refinitiv and msci. de minimis amounts of data are reported on a delayed basis.
(3)   the value of aum in equity etfs linked to msci indexes is calculated by multiplying the equity etf net asset value by the number of shares outstanding.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, the average value of aum in equity etfs linked to msci equity indexes was $886.7 billion, up $72.3 billion, or 8.9%, from $814.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019.
refer to the section titled, "segment results of operations" for an explanation of the results.
the following table presents operating expenses by activity for the years indicated:
cost of revenues cost of revenues for the year ended december 31, 2020 decreased 1.1% to $291.7 million compared to $295.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the change was driven by the absence of $7.0 million of payroll tax expense associated with the vesting of the 2016 multi-year psus recognized during the year ended december 31, 2019, partially offset by increases in other compensation and benefits costs, primarily relating to higher wages and salaries, as well as higher non-compensation costs, reflecting higher information technology costs, partially offset by lower travel and entertainment costs. cost of revenues reflects increases across the all other and index reportable segments, partially offset by a decrease in the analytics reportable segment.
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december 31, 2020 decreased 1.3% to $216.5 million compared to $219.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the change was driven by lower non-compensation costs, including travel and entertainment costs, and the absence of $4.5 million of payroll tax expense associated with the vesting of the 2016 multi-year psus recognized during the year ended december 31, 2019, partially offset by increases in compensation and benefits costs, primarily relating to higher wages and salaries. selling and marketing expenses reflect increases across the all other and analytics reportable segments, partially offset by a decrease in the index reportable segment.
research and development r&d expenses for the year ended december 31, 2020 increased 2.8% to $101.1 million compared to $98.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the change was driven by increases in compensation and benefits costs, including wages and salaries and benefits costs. r&d expenses reflect higher investments in the all other and index reportable segments, partially offset by lower investment in the analytics reportable segment.
general and administrative g&a expenses for the year ended december 31, 2020 increased 4.1% to $114.6 million compared to $110.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the change was driven by increases in compensation and benefits costs, primarily relating to higher incentive compensation and wages and salaries, partially offset by the absence of $3.5 million of payroll tax expense associated with the vesting of the 2016 multi-year psus recognized during the year ended december 31, 2019 and lower non-compensation costs. g&a expenses reflect increases across all three reportable segments.
the following table presents operating expenses using compensation and non-compensation categories, rather than using activity categories, for the years indicated:
compensation and benefits                        $527,641                   $518,730                   $8,911                            1.7    %
compensation and benefits costs are our most significant expense and typically represent approximately 65% of operating expenses or more than 70% of adjusted ebitda expenses. we had 3,633 employees as of december 31, 2020 compared to 3,396 employees as of december 31, 2019, reflecting a 7.0% growth in the number of employees. continued growth of our emerging market centers around the world is an important factor in our ability to manage and control the growth of our compensation and benefits costs. as of december 31, 2020, 64.6% of our employees were located in emerging market centers compared to 62.9% as of december 31, 2019.
compensation and benefits costs for the year ended december 31, 2020 increased 1.7% to $527.6 million compared to $518.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, driven by higher wages and salaries, incentive compensation and benefits costs, partially offset by the absence of $15.4 million of payroll tax expense associated with the vesting of the 2016 multi-year psus recognized during the year ended december 31, 2019.
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets expense for the year ended december 31, 2020 increased 15.2% to $56.9 million compared to $49.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily driven by higher amortization of internally-developed capitalized software.
other expense (income), net other expense (income), net for the year ended december 31, 2020 increased 30.3% to $198.5 million compared to $152.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase in net expenses was primarily driven by the $35.0 million and $10.0 million loss on debt extinguishment associated with the redemption of all of the outstanding $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 senior notes ("2025 senior notes redemption") and the redemption of all of the remaining $300.0 million of the 2024 senior notes ("2024 senior notes redemption"), respectively. the loss on debt extinguishment associated with the 2025 senior notes included an applicable premium of approximately $29.5 million (as defined in the indenture governing the terms of the 2025 senior notes) and the write-off of approximately $5.5 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. the loss on debt extinguishment associated with the 2024 senior notes redemption included a redemption price of approximately $7.9 million (as set forth in the indenture governing the terms of the 2024 senior notes) and the write-off of approximately $2.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. in addition, the increase reflects higher interest expense associated with the higher outstanding debt and lower interest income due to lower rates earned on cash balances, offset by the absence of the $16.8 million loss on extinguishment associated with the partial pre-maturity redemption of the 2024 senior notes recognized during the year ended december 31, 2019.
the effective tax rate of 12.3% for the year ended december 31, 2020 reflects the impact of certain discrete items totaling $47.9 million. these discrete items primarily relate to $22.2 million of excess tax benefits recognized on the vesting of equity awards during the period and $20.8 million released during the year related to the favorable impact on prior years from final regulations clarifying certain provisions of tax reform. also included in the discrete items is a $6.3 million benefit related to the revaluation of the cost of deemed repatriation of foreign earnings.
the effective tax rate of 6.6% for the year ended december 31, 2019 reflects the impact of certain favorable discrete items totaling $85.7 million. these discrete items primarily relate to $66.6 million of excess tax benefits recognized upon vesting of the 2016 multi-year psus and $16.1 million of excess tax benefits on other share-based compensation recognized during the period. in addition, the effective tax rate was impacted by a beneficial geographic mix of earnings.
adjusted ebitda the following table presents the calculation of the non-gaap adjusted ebitda measure for the years indicated:
adjusted ebitda expenses                723,880                    707,297                  16,583                     2.3   %

adjusted ebitda margin %                   57.3   %                   54.6   %
adjusted ebitda increased 14.2% to $971.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to $850.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. adjusted ebitda margin increased to 57.3% for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to 54.6% for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase in adjusted ebitda margin reflects a higher rate of growth in operating revenues as compared to the rate of growth of adjusted ebitda expenses.

revenues from asset-based fees increased 10.5% to $399.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to $361.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase in asset-based fees was driven by growth in revenues from all of our indexed investment product categories, including an increase in revenues from exchange traded futures and options contracts linked to msci indexes that were primarily driven by price increases. the increase in revenues from asset-based fees was also driven by higher revenues from non-etf indexed funds linked to msci indexes, which was driven by price increases and an increase in average aum. revenues from etfs linked to msci indexes also increased, driven by an 8.9% increase in average aum in equity etfs linked to msci indexes, partially offset by a change in fee levels of certain products as well as change in product mix. the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues from asset-based fees was negligible.
index segment adjusted ebitda expenses decreased 0.3% to $250.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to $250.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, reflecting lower expenses across selling and marketing expense activity category, partially offset by higher expenses across the g&a, cost of revenues and r&d expense activity categories. adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, adjusted ebitda expenses would have increased 0.2% for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the year ended december 31, 2019.

analytics segment adjusted ebitda expenses decreased 1.1% to $340.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to $344.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily driven by lower expenses across the cost of revenues and r&d expense activity categories, partially offset by higher expenses across the selling and marketing and g&a expense activity categories. adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, adjusted ebitda expenses would have decreased 0.4% for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the year ended december 31, 2019.

all other segment adjusted ebitda expenses increased 19.0% to $133.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to $111.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, driven by higher expenses attributable mostly to esg operations. adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations,
adjusted ebitda expenses would have increased 19.3% for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the year ended december 31, 2019.
"run rate" estimates at a particular point in time the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client license agreements ("client contracts") for the next 12 months, assuming all client contracts that come up for renewal are renewed and assuming then-current currency exchange rates, subject to the adjustments and exclusions described below.  for any client contract where fees are linked to an investment product's assets or trading volume/fees, the run rate calculation reflects, for etfs, the market value on the last trading day of the period, for futures and options, the most recent quarterly volumes and/or reported exchange fees, and for other non-etf products, the most recent client-reported assets. run rate does not include fees associated with "one-time" and other non-recurring transactions.  in addition, we add to run rate the annualized fee value of recurring new sales, whether to existing or new clients, when we execute client contracts, even though the license start date, and associated revenue recognition, may not be effective until a later date. we remove from run rate the annualized fee value associated with products or services under any client contract with respect to which we have received a notice of termination or non-renewal during the period and have determined that such notice evidences the client's final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable products or services, even though such notice is not effective until a later date.
•   fluctuations in revenues associated with new recurring sales;
•   differences between the recurring license start date and the date the client contract is executed due to, for example, contracts with onboarding periods or fee waiver periods;
•   revenue recognition differences under u.s. gaap, including those related to the timing of implementation and report deliveries for certain of our products and services;
•   the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.
run rate from asset-based fees increased 17.2% to $464.1 million as of december 31, 2020, from $396.1 million as of december 31, 2019, driven by higher aum in equity etfs linked to msci indexes, higher prices in futures and options and higher prices in non-etf indexed funds linked to msci indexes. partially offsetting the impact of the increase in aum in equity etfs linked to msci indexes was a change in fee levels of certain products as well as change in product mix, which was the primary driver of a decline in average basis point fees to 2.67 at december 31, 2020 from 2.82 at december 31, 2019. as of december 31, 2020, the value of aum in equity etfs linked to msci indexes was $1,103.6 billion, up $169.2 billion, or 18.1%, from $934.4 billion as of december 31, 2019. the increase of $169.2 billion consisted of market appreciation of $93.6 billion and net inflows of $75.6 billion.
run rate from analytics products increased 5.4% to $555.1 million as of december 31, 2020 compared to $526.8 million as of december 31, 2019, driven by growth in both multi-asset class and equity analytics products. adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, analytics run rate would have increased 4.0% as of december 31, 2020 compared to december 31, 2019.
sales sales represents the annualized value of products and services clients commit to purchase from msci and will result in additional operating revenues. non-recurring sales represent the actual value of the customer agreements entered into during the period and are not a component of run rate. new recurring subscription sales represent
additional selling activities, such as new customer agreements, additions to existing agreements or increases in price that occurred during the period and are additions to run rate. subscription cancellations reflect client activities during the period, such as discontinuing products and services and/or reductions in price, resulting in reductions to run rate. net new recurring subscription sales represent the amount of new recurring subscription sales net of subscription cancellations during the period, which reflects the net impact to run rate during the period.
retention rate is computed by operating segment on a product/service-by-product/service basis. in general, if a client reduces the number of products or services to which it subscribes within a segment, or switches between products or services within a segment, we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our retention rate except in the case of a product or service switch that management considers to be a replacement product or service. in those replacement cases, only the net change to the client subscription, if a decrease, is reported as a cancel.  in the analytics and the esg operating segments, substantially all product or service switches are treated as replacement products or services and netted in this manner, while in our index and real estate operating segments, product or service switches that are treated as replacement products or services and receive netting treatment occur only in certain limited instances. in addition, we treat any reduction in fees resulting from a down-sale of the same product or service as a cancellation to the extent of the reduction. we do not calculate retention rate for that portion of our run rate attributable to assets in indexed investment products or futures and options contracts, in each case, linked to our indexes.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, 30.4% of our cancellations occurred in the fourth quarter. in our product lines, retention rate is generally higher during the first three quarters and lower in the fourth quarter, as the fourth quarter is traditionally the largest renewal period in the year.
liquidity and capital resources we require capital to fund ongoing operations, internal growth initiatives and acquisitions. our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, existing cash and cash equivalents and credit capacity under our existing credit facilities. in addition, we believe we have access to additional funding in the public and private markets. we intend to use these sources of liquidity to, among other things, service our existing and future debt obligations, fund our working capital requirements for capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. in connection with our business strategy, we regularly evaluate acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities. we believe our liquidity, along with other financing alternatives, will provide the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth.
senior notes and credit agreement we have an aggregate of $3,400.0 million in senior unsecured notes (collectively, the "senior notes") outstanding and a $400.0 million undrawn revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks as of december 31, 2020. see note 5, "commitments and contingencies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our senior notes and revolving credit agreement.
the senior notes and the revolving credit agreement are fully and unconditionally, and jointly and severally, guaranteed by our direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that account for more than 5% of our and our subsidiaries' consolidated assets, other than certain excluded subsidiaries (the "subsidiary guarantors"). amounts due under the revolving credit agreement are our and the subsidiary guarantors' senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with the senior notes and any of our other unsecured, unsubordinated debt, senior to any of our subordinated debt and effectively subordinated to our secured debt to the extent of the assets securing such debt.
the indentures governing our senior notes (the "indentures") among us, each of the subsidiary guarantors, and wells fargo bank, national association, as trustee, contain covenants that limit our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets. in addition, the indentures restrict our non-guarantor subsidiaries' ability to create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness without such non-guarantor subsidiaries guaranteeing the senior notes on a pari passu basis.
the revolving credit agreement contains affirmative and restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our existing or future subsidiaries to:
•   incur additional indebtedness or prepay, redeem or repurchase indebtedness;
•   merge, dissolve, liquidate, consolidate with or into another person;
•   enter into acquisition transactions;
•   issue disqualified capital stock;
•   pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of our capital stock or engage in stock repurchases, redemptions and other restricted payments;
•   permit certain restrictions affecting our subsidiaries;
•   enter into any transactions with affiliates other than on an arm's-length basis; and
the revolving credit agreement and the indentures also contain customary events of default, including those relating to non-payment, breach of representations, warranties or covenants, cross-default and cross-acceleration, bankruptcy and insolvency events, invalidity or impairment of loan documentation or collateral, change of control and customary erisa defaults. none of the restrictions above are expected to impact our ability to effectively operate the business.
the revolving credit agreement also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve financial and operating results sufficient to maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis through the termination of the revolving credit agreement: (1) the maximum consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit agreement) measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis shall not exceed 4.25:1.00 and (2) the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the revolving credit agreement) measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis shall be at least 4.00:1.00. as of december 31, 2020, our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.21:1.00 and our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 6.29:1.00. as of december 31, 2020, there were no amounts drawn and outstanding under the revolving credit agreement.
our non-guarantor subsidiaries under the senior notes consist of: (i) domestic subsidiaries of the company that account for 5% or less of consolidated assets of the company and its subsidiaries and (ii) any foreign or domestic subsidiary of the company that is deemed to be a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended. our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $989.3 million, or 58.4%, of our total revenue for the 12 months ended december 31, 2020, approximately $351.7 million, or 39.8%, of our consolidated operating income for the 12 months ended december 31, 2020, and approximately $1,065.4 million, or 25.3%, of our consolidated total assets (excluding intercompany assets) and $756.9 million, or 16.3%, of our consolidated total liabilities, in each case as of december 31, 2020.
share repurchases the board of directors has approved a stock repurchase program for the purchase of the company's common stock in the open market. see note 10, "shareholders' equity (deficit)," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our stock repurchase program.
as of february 5, 2021, a total of $1,728.8 million remained available on the share repurchase authorization. this authorization may be modified, suspended or terminated by the board of directors at any time without prior notice.
cash dividends on september 17, 2014, our board of directors approved a plan to initiate a regular quarterly cash dividend to our shareholders. on october 30, 2014, we began paying regular quarterly cash dividends and have paid such dividends each quarter thereafter.
net cash provided by operating activities   $811,109                      $709,523
net cash used in investing activities                (241,791    )                 (71,937   )
net cash used in financing activities                (779,038    )                 (36,667   )
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents were $1,300.5 million and $1,506.6 million as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. we typically seek to maintain minimum cash balances globally of approximately $200.0 million to $250.0 million for general operating purposes but may maintain higher minimum cash balances while the covid-19 pandemic continues to impact global economic markets. as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, $423.4 million and $321.2 million, respectively, of the cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. as a result of tax reform, we can now more efficiently access a significant portion of our cash held outside of the u.s. in the short-term without being subject to u.s. income taxes. repatriation of some foreign cash may be subject to certain withholding taxes in local jurisdictions and other distribution restrictions. the global cash and cash equivalent balances that are maintained will be available to meet our global needs whether for general corporate purpose or other needs, including acquisitions or expansion of our products.
cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. cash provided by operating activities was $811.1 million and $709.5 million for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher cash collections from customers, partially offset by higher payments for income taxes, interest and cash expenses.
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for the payment of cash compensation expenses, office rent, technology costs, market data costs, interest expenses and income taxes. historically, the payment of cash for compensation and benefits is at its highest level in the first quarter when we pay discretionary employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year.
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities was $241.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to $71.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the year-over-year change was primarily driven by the $190.8 million investment in burgiss.
cash flows from financing activities cash used in financing activities was $779.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to $36.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the year-over-year change was primarily driven by higher share repurchases, the impact of the 2024 senior notes redemption and the 2025 senior notes redemption, partially offset by the impact of new senior notes offerings made during the periods.
we believe that global cash flows from operations, together with existing cash and cash equivalents and funds available under our existing credit facility and our ability to access the debt and capital markets for additional funds, will continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as material capital expenditures and share repurchases, for at least the 12 months following issuance of this form 10-k and for the foreseeable future thereafter. in addition, we expect that foreign cash flows from operations, together with existing cash and cash equivalents, will continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the 12 months following issuance of this form 10-k and for the foreseeable future thereafter.
(2)   primarily includes amounts payable related to the estimated toll charge. the toll charge is included within "other non-current liabilities" in our consolidated statements of financial condition.
the obligations related to our uncertain tax positions, which are not considered material, have been excluded from the table above because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing and final amounts of any settlement.
off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in 2018, we set out to simplify sempra energy's business model and sharpen our focus on our mission to be north america's premier energy infrastructure company. our 2020 operational and financial results reflect our focus on executing this strategy:
▪we executed well on our planned capital expenditures our south american businesses and certain activities associated with those businesses are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. nominal activities that are not classified as discontinued operations have been subsumed into parent and other. our discussions below exclude discontinued operations, unless otherwise noted.

▪$62 million due to the release of a regulatory liability in 2020 related to 2016-2018 forecasting differences that are not subject to tracking in the income tax expense memorandum account, which we discuss in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements;
▪$23 million higher afudc equity; and
▪$16 million higher income tax benefits from flow-through items; offset by
▪$31 million income tax benefit in 2019 from the release of a regulatory liability established in connection with 2017 tax reform for excess deferred income tax balances that the cpuc directed to be allocated to shareholders in a january 2019 decision;

sempra texas utilities the increase in earnings of $51 million (10%) in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to higher equity earnings from oncor holdings driven by:
▪increased revenues from rate updates to reflect increases in invested capital and customer growth;
▪the impact of oncor's acquisition of infrareit in may 2019; and
▪higher afudc equity; offset by
▪unfavorable weather and increased operating costs and expenses attributable to invested capital.
the increase in earnings of $157 million (42%) in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily represented higher equity earnings from oncor holdings, which we acquired in march 2018, driven by the impact of oncor's acquisition of infrareit in may 2019 and higher revenues due to rate updates to reflect increases in invested transmission capital, offset by higher operating costs.
sempra mexico because ecogas, our natural gas distribution utility in mexico, uses the local currency as its functional currency, its revenues and expenses are translated into u.s. dollars at average exchange rates for the period for consolidation in sempra energy's results of operations. prior year amounts used in the variances discussed below are as adjusted for the difference in foreign currency translation rates between years. we discuss these and other foreign currency effects below in "impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on results of operations."

▪$44 million income tax expense in 2018 to adjust tcja provisional amounts recorded in 2017 primarily related to withholding tax on our expected future repatriation of foreign undistributed earnings; offset by
significant changes in revenues, costs and earnings this section contains a discussion of the differences between periods in the specific line items of the consolidated statements of operations for sempra energy, sdg&e and socalgas.
utilities revenues and cost of sales our utilities revenues include natural gas revenues at our california utilities and sempra mexico's ecogas and electric revenues at sdg&e. intercompany revenues included in the separate revenues of each utility are eliminated in the sempra energy consolidated statements of operations.
socalgas and sdg&e currently operate under a regulatory framework that permits:
▪the cost of natural gas purchased for core customers (primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers) to be passed through to customers in rates substantially as incurred. however, socalgas' gcim provides socalgas the opportunity to share in the savings and/or costs from buying natural gas for its core customers at prices below or above monthly market-based benchmarks. this mechanism permits full recovery of costs incurred when average purchase costs are within a price range around the benchmark price. any higher costs incurred or savings realized outside this range are shared between the core customers and socalgas.
▪sdg&e to recover the actual cost incurred to generate or procure electricity based on annual estimates of the cost of electricity supplied to customers. the differences in cost between estimates and actual are recovered or refunded in subsequent periods through rates.
▪the california utilities to recover certain program expenditures and other costs authorized by the cpuc, or "refundable programs."
because changes in socalgas' and sdg&e's cost of natural gas and/or electricity are recovered in rates, changes in these costs are offset in the changes in revenues and therefore do not impact earnings. in addition to the changes in cost or market prices, natural gas or electric revenues recorded during a period are impacted by customer billing cycles causing a difference between customer billings and recorded or authorized costs. these differences are required to be balanced over time, resulting in over- and undercollected regulatory balancing accounts.
the table below summarizes utilities revenues and cost of sales.
utilities revenues and cost of sales
total utilities revenues                                $10,025                          $9,448                          $8,539
natural gas revenues and cost of natural gas the table below summarizes the average cost of natural gas sold by the california utilities and included in cost of natural gas on the consolidated statements of operations. the average cost of natural gas sold at each utility is impacted by market prices, as well as transportation, tariff and other charges.

▪$44 million income tax benefit in 2020 compared to $71 million income tax expense in 2019 from foreign currency and inflation effects primarily as a result of fluctuation of the mexican peso;
▪$26 million income tax benefit in 2020 compared to $7 million income tax expense in 2019 from changes to a valuation allowance against certain tax credit carryforwards; and
▪$19 million income tax benefit in 2020 compared to $4 million income tax expense in 2019 related to share-based compensation; offset by
▪$69 million total income tax benefits in 2019 from the release of regulatory liabilities at sdg&e and socalgas established in connection with 2017 tax reform for excess deferred income tax balances that the cpuc directed be allocated to shareholders in a january 2019 decision; and
▪$10 million income tax benefit in 2019 from a reduction in a valuation allowance against certain nol carryforwards as a result of our decision to sell our south american businesses.
sempra energy's income tax expense in 2019 compared to an income tax benefit in 2018 was due to higher pretax income and a higher etr. pretax income in 2018 was impacted by the impairments at our sempra lng and sempra renewables segments offset by the gain from sale of assets at sempra renewables. the change in etr was primarily due to:
▪$131 million income tax benefit in 2018 resulting from the reduced outside basis difference in sempra lng as a result of the impairment of certain non-utility natural gas storage assets; and
▪$69 million total income tax benefits in 2019 from the release of regulatory liabilities at sdg&e and socalgas established in connection with 2017 tax reform for excess deferred income tax balances that the cpuc directed be allocated to shareholders in a january 2019 decision;
▪$21 million income tax expense in 2018 associated with aliso canyon natural gas storage facility litigation; and
▪$10 million income tax benefit in 2019 from a reduction in a valuation allowance against certain nol carryforwards as a result of our decision to sell our south american businesses.
we report as part of our pretax results the income or loss attributable to nci. however, we do not record income taxes for a portion of this income or loss, as some of our entities with nci are currently treated as partnerships for income tax purposes, and thus we are only liable for income taxes on the portion of the earnings that are allocated to us. our pretax income, however, includes 100% of these entities. if our entities with nci grow, and if we continue to invest in such entities, the impact on our etr may become more significant.
we discuss the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and inflation on income taxes below in "impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on results of operations." see notes 1 and 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details about our accounting for income taxes and items subject to flow-through treatment.

▪higher income tax benefits in 2020 from flow-through deductions.
sdg&e's income tax expense decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to a lower etr offset by higher pretax income. the change in etr was primarily due to a $31 million income tax benefit in 2019 from the release of a regulatory liability established in connection with 2017 tax reform for excess deferred income tax balances that the cpuc directed be allocated to shareholders in a january 2019 decision.

equity earnings equity earnings increased by $435 million to $1.0 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to:
▪$367 million higher equity earnings from cameron lng jv primarily due to commencement of phase 1 commercial operations;
▪$94 million higher equity earnings at img jv, primarily due to higher revenues from the start of commercial operations of the sur de texas-tuxpan marine pipeline and foreign currency effects, including $42 million foreign currency gains in 2020 compared to $30 million foreign currency losses in 2019 on img jv's mexican peso-denominated loans from its jv owners, which is fully offset in other (expense) income, net, offset by lower afudc equity;

preferred dividends increased by $17 million (14%) to $142 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to dividends associated with our series b preferred stock, which was issued in july 2018.
impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on results of operations because our natural gas distribution utility in mexico, ecogas, uses its local currency as its functional currency, revenues and expenses are translated into u.s. dollars at average exchange rates for the period for consolidation in sempra energy consolidated's results of operations. prior to the sales of our south american businesses in 2020, our operations in south america used their local currency as their functional currency.
foreign currency translation any difference in average exchange rates used for the translation of income statement activity from year to year can cause a variance in sempra energy's comparative results of operations. changes in foreign currency translation rates between years resulted in $9 million lower earnings in 2020 compared to 2019 and $8 million lower earnings in 2019 compared to 2018.
transactional impacts income statement activities at our foreign operations and their jvs are also impacted by transactional gains and losses, a summary of which is shown in the table below:
income tax (expense) benefit                                     (249)                     (315)                      49                        44                      (71)                      (26)
equity earnings                                                  1,015       580                                     175                        43                      (47)                      (14)
foreign currency exchange rate and inflation impacts on income taxes and related hedging activity our mexican subsidiaries have u.s. dollar-denominated cash balances, receivables, payables and debt (monetary assets and liabilities) that are affected by mexican currency exchange rate movements for mexican income tax purposes. they also have deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are significant, denominated in the mexican peso that must be translated to u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes. in addition, monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for mexican inflation for mexican income tax purposes. as a result, fluctuations in both the currency exchange rate for the mexican peso against the u.s. dollar and mexican inflation may expose us to fluctuations in income tax expense, other (expense) income, net and equity earnings. we may use foreign currency derivatives as a means to help manage exposure to the currency exchange rate on our monetary assets and liabilities, and this derivative activity impacts other (expense) income, net. however, we generally do not hedge our deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which makes us susceptible to volatility in income tax expense caused by exchange rate fluctuations and inflation.
other transactions although the financial statements of most of our mexican subsidiaries and jvs have the u.s. dollar as the functional currency, some transactions may be denominated in the local currency; such transactions are remeasured into u.s. dollars. this remeasurement creates transactional gains and losses that are included in other (expense) income, net, for our consolidated subsidiaries and in equity earnings for our jvs.
certain of our mexican pipelines (namely los ramones i at ienova pipelines and los ramones norte at tag jv) generate revenue based on tariffs that are set by government agencies in mexico, with contracts denominated in mexican pesos that are indexed to the u.s. dollar, adjusted annually for inflation and fluctuation in the exchange rate. the resultant gains and losses from remeasuring the local currency amounts into u.s. dollars and the settlement of foreign currency forwards and swaps related to these contracts are included in revenues: energy-related businesses or equity earnings.
capital resources and liquidity overview sempra energy consolidated impact of the covid-19 pandemic on march 11, 2020, the world health organization declared the covid-19 outbreak to be a pandemic. the u.s. government officially declared a national emergency on march 13, 2020, and the mexican government announced a national state of sanitary emergency on march 30, 2020. the covid-19 pandemic is materially impacting the economy, including a surge in unemployment claims and, at times, substantial volatility in financial markets, and has resulted in action by governments and other authorities to help address these effects. for example:
▪the cpuc required that all energy companies under its jurisdiction, including the california utilities, take action to implement several emergency customer protection measures to support california customers. the measures currently apply to all residential and small business customers affected by the covid-19 pandemic and include suspending service disconnections due to nonpayment, waiving late payment fees, and offering flexible payment plans to all customers experiencing difficulty paying their electric or gas bills. the cpuc approved a resolution authorizing each of the california utilities to track and request recovery of incremental costs associated with complying with residential and small business customer protection measures implemented by the cpuc related to the covid-19 pandemic, including costs associated with suspending service disconnections and uncollectible expenses that arise from these customers' failure to pay. although we are tracking these costs in various regulatory mechanisms, recovery is not assured. the continuation of these circumstances could result in a further reduction in payments received from the california utilities' customers and a further increase in uncollectible accounts, which could become material, and any inability or delay in recovering all or a substantial portion of these costs could have a material adverse effect on the cash flows, financial condition and results of operations of sempra energy, sdg&e and socalgas. we discuss regulatory mechanisms in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
▪in texas, the puct issued orders creating the covid-19 electricity relief program and suspending service disconnections due to nonpayment for customers enrolled in the program through september 30, 2020. the covid-19 electricity relief program created a fund through which transmission and distribution utilities and retail electric providers in texas may seek to recover certain costs (including transmission and distribution utility electricity delivery charges) of providing uninterrupted services to customers facing financial hardship due to the effects of the covid-19 pandemic. financial assistance under the program was available to enrolled residential customers for electricity bills issued on or after march 26, 2020 through september 30, 2020. the puct has also authorized the use of a regulatory asset accounting mechanism and a subsequent process through which regulated utility companies may seek future recovery of other expenses resulting from the effects of the covid-19 pandemic. rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs. the regulatory assets established with respect to covid-19 pandemic costs are subject to puct review for reasonableness and possible disallowance. any inability to recover these costs could have an adverse effect on the cash flows, financial condition and results of operations of sempra energy.
▪on march 27, 2020, the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act (cares act) was enacted and signed into law in response to the covid-19 pandemic. among other things, the cares act contains significant business tax provisions, including a delay of payment of employer payroll taxes and an acceleration of refunds of corporate alternative minimum tax (amt) credits. sempra energy, sdg&e and socalgas have deferred payment of the employer's share of payroll taxes through the end of 2020, with half of such taxes to be paid by the end of 2021 and the other half to be paid by the end of 2022. in 2020, sempra energy filed and received a refund claim for its corporate amt credits, rather than receiving it in installments through 2021.
our businesses that invest in, develop and operate energy infrastructure and provide electric and gas services to customers have been identified as critical or essential services in the u.s. and mexico and have continued to operate throughout the covid-19 pandemic. as our businesses continue to operate, our priority is the safety of our employees, customers, partners and the communities we serve. we and other companies, including our partners, are taking steps to try to protect the health and well-being of our employees and other stakeholders. for example, we have activated our business continuity plans and continue to work closely with local, state and federal authorities to provide essential services with minimum interruption to customers and in accordance with applicable shelter-in-place and other orders. we have implemented precautionary measures across our businesses, including requiring employees to work remotely when possible, restricting non-essential business travel, increasing facility sanitization and communicating proper health and safety protocols to employees. we also have engaged an infectious disease expert to advise us during this public health crisis. throughout 2020, these actions have not required significant outlays of capital and have not had a material impact on our results of operations, but these or other measures that we may implement in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, financial position and results of operations if circumstances related to the covid-19 pandemic worsen or continue for an extended period of time.
the covid-19 pandemic and its widespread effects also have impacted our capital plans, liquidity and asset values, as we discuss with respect to each of our segments below. we perform recovery testing of our recorded asset values when market conditions indicate that such values may not be recoverable. given the current environment (including the decline in the price of our common stock, financial market volatility, high unemployment rates, reduction in customer collections that could become material, inability to secure permits and other authorizations due to government closures, and governments pursuing new laws or policies that modify pre-existing contract terms or alter operations), we evaluated whether these events or changes in circumstances resulted in an impairment of our long-lived assets, intangible assets or goodwill in 2020 and concluded that no such impairment was warranted. however, as the effects of the covid-19 pandemic evolve, we will continue to periodically assess the need to perform interim impairment tests. a significant impairment charge related to our long-lived assets, intangible assets or goodwill would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it is recorded.
for a further discussion of risks and uncertainties related to the covid-19 pandemic, see below in "part i - item 1a. risk factors."
liquidity we expect to meet our cash requirements through cash flows from operations, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from recent asset sales, borrowings under our credit facilities, distributions from our equity method investments, issuances of debt, project financing and partnering in jvs. we believe that these cash flow sources, combined with available funds, will be adequate to fund our current operations, including to:
▪finance capital expenditures
▪meet liquidity requirements
▪fund new business or asset acquisitions or start-ups
▪fund capital contribution requirements
▪fund expenditures related to the natural gas leak at socalgas' aliso canyon natural gas storage facility sempra energy and the california utilities currently have reasonable access to the money markets and capital markets and are not currently constrained in their ability to borrow money at reasonable rates from commercial banks, under existing revolving credit facilities or through public offerings registered with the sec. however, the money markets and capital markets in general, including particularly the commercial paper markets, and the availability of financing from commercial banks have experienced distress at times during 2020 due to the covid-19 pandemic, and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets or obtain credit from commercial banks outside of our committed revolving credit facilities could become materially constrained if changing economic conditions and disruptions to the money markets and capital markets, due to the covid-19 pandemic or otherwise, worsen. in addition, our financing activities and actions by credit rating agencies, as well as many other factors, could negatively affect the availability and cost of both short-term and long-term financing. also, cash flows from operations may be impacted by the timing of commencement and completion, and potentially cost overruns, of large projects. if cash flows from operations were to be significantly reduced or we were unable to borrow under acceptable terms, we would likely first reduce or postpone discretionary capital expenditures (not related to safety) and investments in new businesses. we monitor our ability to finance the needs of our operating, investing and financing activities in a manner consistent with our intention to maintain our investment-grade credit ratings and capital structure.
we have significant investments in several trusts to provide for future payments of pensions and other postretirement benefits and nuclear decommissioning. changes in asset values, which are dependent on activity in the equity and fixed income markets, have not materially and adversely affected the trust funds' abilities to make required payments. however, changes in these or other factors in future periods, such as changes to discount rates, assumed rates of return, mortality tables and regulations, may impact funding requirements for pension and other postretirement benefits plans. funding requirements for sdg&e's ndt could also be impacted by the timing and amount of songs decommissioning costs. at the california utilities, funding requirements are generally recoverable in rates. we discuss our employee benefit plans and sdg&e's ndt, including our investment allocation strategies for assets in these trusts, in notes 9 and 15, respectively, of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
available funds our committed lines of credit provide liquidity and support commercial paper. as we discuss in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, sempra energy, sempra global, sdg&e and socalgas each have five-year credit agreements expiring in 2024. in addition, sempra mexico has committed lines of credit that expire in 2021 and 2024 and an uncommitted revolving credit facility that expires in 2023. the table below shows the amount of available funds at december 31, 2020, including available unused credit on these primary u.s. and foreign lines of credit.
available unused credit(2)(3)                   7,700                               1,500             637
(2)    available unused credit is the total available on sempra energy's, sempra global's, sdg&e's, socalgas' and sempra mexico's credit facilities that we discuss in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
(3)    because our commercial paper programs are supported by these lines, we reflect the amount of commercial paper outstanding as a reduction to the available unused credit.
short-term borrowings we use short-term debt primarily to meet liquidity requirements, fund shareholder dividends, and temporarily finance capital expenditures, acquisitions or start-ups. our california utilities use short-term debt primarily to meet working capital needs. due to volatility in commercial paper markets shortly following the start of the covid-19 pandemic, commercial paper borrowing at that time became less desirable and, in some cases, not competitive or unavailable. to secure sufficient sources of liquidity during this period, sempra energy, sempra global, sdg&e, socalgas and ienova each drew amounts under their respective credit facilities and sempra energy and sdg&e each also obtained short-term term loans, much of which has been subsequently repaid. revolving lines of credit, term loans and commercial paper were our primary sources of short-term debt funding in 2020.
we discuss our short-term debt activities in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
long-term debt activities major issuances of and payments on long-term debt in 2020 included the following:
issuances:                                                                                         amount at issuance                      maturity sdg&amp;e variable rate 364-day term loan                                                               $200                                   2021

sdg&e used the proceeds from its long-term debt offerings to repay first mortgage bonds, commercial paper and line of credit borrowings, for working capital and for other general corporate purposes.
socalgas used the proceeds from its long-term debt offerings to repay commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.
sempra mexico used the proceeds from its issuances of long-term debt to finance the construction of solar generation projects, to repay line of credit borrowings and for other general corporate purposes.
we discuss our long-term debt activities in note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
credit ratings the credit ratings of sempra energy, sdg&e and socalgas remained at investment grade levels in 2020. on january 29, 2021, moody's placed the long-term debt ratings of sdg&e on review for upgrade.
credit ratings at december 31, 2020
sempra energy                       sdg&amp;e                           socalgas moody's                 baa2 with a stable outlook          baa1 with a positive outlook        a2 with a stable outlook s&amp;p                 bbb+ with a negative outlook        bbb+ with a negative outlook        a with a negative outlook fitch                   bbb+ with a stable outlook          bbb+ with a stable outlook          a with a stable outlook a downgrade of sempra energy's or any of its subsidiaries' credit ratings or rating outlooks may, depending on the severity, result in a requirement for collateral to be posted in the case of certain financing arrangements and may materially and adversely affect the market prices of their equity and debt securities, the rates at which borrowings are made and commercial paper is issued, and the various fees on their outstanding credit facilities. we provide additional information about our credit ratings at sempra energy, sdg&e and socalgas in "part i - item 1a. risk factors."
sempra energy has agreed that, if the credit rating of oncor's senior secured debt by any of the three major rating agencies falls below bbb (or the equivalent), oncor will suspend dividends and other distributions (except for contractual tax payments), unless otherwise allowed by the puct. oncor's senior secured debt was rated a2, a+ and a at moody's, s&p and fitch, respectively, at december 31, 2020.
sempra energy, sdg&e and socalgas have committed lines of credit to provide liquidity and to support commercial paper. borrowings under these facilities bear interest at benchmark rates plus a margin that varies with market index rates and each borrower's credit rating. each facility also requires a commitment fee on available unused credit that may be impacted by each borrower's credit rating. depending on the severity of the downgrade:
▪if sempra energy were to experience a ratings downgrade from its current level, the rate at which borrowings bear interest would increase by 25 to 50 bps. the commitment fee on available unused credit would also increase 5 to 10 bps.
▪if sdg&e were to experience a ratings downgrade from its current level, the rate at which borrowings bear interest would increase by 25 to 50 bps. the commitment fee on available unused credit would also increase 5 to 10 bps.
▪if socalgas were to experience a ratings downgrade from its current level, the rate at which borrowings bear interest would increase by 12.5 bps. the commitment fee on available unused credit would also increase 2.5 bps.
sempra energy's and sdg&e's credit ratings also may affect their respective credit limits related to derivative instruments, as we discuss in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
california utilities sdg&e's and socalgas' operations have historically provided relatively stable earnings and liquidity. their future performance and liquidity will depend primarily on the ratemaking and regulatory process, environmental regulations, economic conditions, actions by the california legislature, litigation and the changing energy marketplace, as well as other matters described in this report.
sdg&e and socalgas expect that the available unused credit from their credit facilities described above, cash flows from operations, and debt issuances will continue to be adequate to fund their respective current operations and planned capital expenditures. the california utilities are continuing to monitor the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on cash flows and results of operations. some customers are experiencing a diminished ability to pay their electric or gas bills, leading to slower payments and higher levels of nonpayment than has been the case historically. these impacts could become significant and could require modifications to our financing plans. the california utilities manage their capital structure and pay dividends when appropriate and as approved by their respective boards of directors.
disconnection oir in june 2020, the cpuc issued a decision addressing service disconnections that, among other things, allows each of the california utilities to establish a two-way balancing account to record the uncollectible expenses associated with residential customers' inability to pay their electric or gas bills. this decision also directs the california utilities to establish an amp that provides successfully participating, income-qualified residential customers with relief from outstanding utility bill amounts and is effective as of february 2021. the california utilities have recorded increases in their allowances for uncollectible accounts at december 31, 2020 primarily related to expected forgiveness of outstanding bill amounts for customers eligible under the amp. the amp could result in a further reduction in payments received from the california utilities' customers and a further increase to uncollectible accounts, which could become material, and any inability to recover these costs could have a material adverse effect on the cash flows, financial condition and results of operations of sempra energy, sdg&e and socalgas.
pipeline safety enhancement plan in november 2018, socalgas and sdg&e filed a joint application with the cpuc for a reasonableness review of psep project costs totaling $941 million for 83 pipeline safety enhancement projects. socalgas and sdg&e subsequently entered into a settlement agreement for cost recovery of $935 million ($806 million for socalgas and $129 million for sdg&e). a final decision was approved in august 2020, granting the proposed settlement agreement as well as the amortization schedule for recovery of costs. the final decision was implemented in rates on october 1, 2020.
ccm a cpuc cost of capital proceeding determines a utility's authorized capital structure and authorized return on rate base and addresses the ccm. the ccm, if triggered in 2021, would be effective january 1, 2022, and would automatically update the california utilities' authorized cost of debt based on actual costs and update the california utilities' authorized roe. a trigger of the ccm that requires a downward adjustment beginning january 1, 2022 could materially adversely affect the results of operations and cash flows of sempra energy and, depending on the ccm that is triggered, sdg&e and socalgas. we discuss the ccm further in "part i - item 1. business - ratemaking mechanisms - california utilities - cost of capital proceedings," "part i - item 1a. risk factors" and in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
sdg&e wildfire fund in 2019, sdg&e recorded a wildfire fund asset for committed shareholder contributions to the wildfire fund. we describe the wildfire legislation and related accounting treatment in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
sdg&e is exposed to the risk that the participating california electric ious may incur third-party wildfire claims for which they will seek recovery from the wildfire fund. in such a situation, sdg&e may recognize a reduction of its wildfire fund asset and record a charge against earnings in the period when there is a reduction of the available coverage due to recoverable claims from any of the participating ious. as a result, if any california electric iou's equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire, it could have a material adverse effect on sdg&e's and sempra energy's financial condition and results of operations up to the carrying value of our wildfire fund asset, with additional potential material exposure if sdg&e's equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire. in addition, the wildfire fund could be completely exhausted due to fires in the other california electric ious' service territories, by fires in sdg&e's service territory or by a combination thereof. in 2020, california experienced some of the largest wildfires in its history (measured by acres burned), including fires in sdg&e's service territory. although sdg&e is not aware of any claims made against the wildfire fund by any participating iou, there is no assurance that the equipment of a california electric iou will not be determined to be a cause of one or more of these fires. in the event that the wildfire fund is materially diminished, exhausted or terminated, sdg&e will lose the protection afforded by the wildfire fund, and as a consequence, a fire in sdg&e's service territory could cause a material adverse effect on sdg&e's and sempra energy's cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
socalgas socalgas' future performance and liquidity will be impacted by the resolution of legal, regulatory and other matters concerning the leak, which we discuss below, in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, and in "part i - item 1a. risk factors."
aliso canyon natural gas storage facility gas leak from october 23, 2015 through february 11, 2016, socalgas experienced a natural gas leak from one of the injection-and-withdrawal wells, ss25, at its aliso canyon natural gas storage facility located in los angeles county. in february 2016, calgem confirmed that the well was permanently sealed.
except for the amounts paid or estimated to settle certain actions, the cost estimate does not include litigation or regulatory costs to the extent it is not possible to predict at this time the outcome of these actions or reasonably estimate the costs to defend or resolve the actions or the amount of damages, restitution, or civil, administrative or criminal fines, sanctions, penalties or other costs or remedies that may be imposed or incurred. the cost estimate also does not include certain other costs incurred by sempra energy associated with defending against shareholder derivative lawsuits and other potential costs that we currently do not anticipate incurring or that we cannot reasonably estimate. these costs not included in the cost estimate could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on socalgas' and sempra energy's cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
we have received insurance payments for many of the costs included in the cost estimate, including temporary relocation and associated processing costs, control-of-well expenses, costs of the government-ordered response to the leak, certain legal costs and lost gas. as of december 31, 2020, we recorded the expected recovery of the cost estimate related to the leak of $445 million as insurance receivable for aliso canyon costs on socalgas' and sempra energy's consolidated balance sheets. this amount is exclusive of insurance retentions and $834 million of insurance proceeds we received through december 31, 2020. we intend to pursue the full extent of our insurance coverage for the costs we have incurred. other than insurance for certain future defense costs we may incur as well as directors' and officers' liability, we have exhausted all of our insurance in this matter. we continue to pursue other sources of insurance coverage for costs related to this matter, but we may not be successful in obtaining additional insurance recovery for any of these costs. if we are not able to secure additional insurance recovery, if any costs we have recorded as an insurance receivable are not collected, if there are delays in receiving insurance recoveries, or if the insurance recoveries are subject to income taxes while the associated costs are not tax deductible, such amounts, which could be significant, could have a material adverse effect on socalgas' and sempra energy's cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
natural gas storage operations and reliability. natural gas withdrawn from storage is important for service reliability during peak demand periods, including peak electric generation needs in the summer and consumer heating needs in the winter. the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility is the largest socalgas storage facility and an important element of socalgas' delivery system. as a result of the leak, socalgas suspended injection of natural gas into the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility beginning in october 2015 and, following a comprehensive safety review and authorization by calgem and the cpuc's executive director, resumed injection operations in july 2017 based on limited operating ranges for the field. in february 2017, the cpuc opened a proceeding pursuant to sb 380 oii to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region, including considering alternative means for meeting or avoiding the demand for the facility's services if it were eliminated.
the cpuc has issued a series of directives to socalgas specifying the range of working gas to be maintained in the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility as well as protocols for the withdrawal of gas, to support safe and reliable natural gas service. withdrawals of natural gas from the facility were made in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to augment natural gas supplies to meet consumer demand, including for electric generation needs.
if the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility were to be permanently closed, or if future cash flows from its operation were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value, it could result in an impairment of the facility and significantly higher than expected operating costs and/or additional capital expenditures, and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized. at december 31, 2020, the aliso canyon natural gas storage facility had a net book value of $821 million. any significant impairment of this asset, or higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures incurred by socalgas that may not be recoverable in customer rates, could have a material adverse effect on socalgas' and sempra energy's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
oscs - energy efficiency and advocacy as we discuss in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, in october 2019, the cpuc issued an osc to determine whether socalgas should be sanctioned for violation of certain cpuc code sections and orders related to energy efficiency codes and standards advocacy activities undertaken by socalgas in 2018. in december 2019, the cpuc issued a second osc to determine whether socalgas is entitled to the energy efficiency program's shareholder incentives for codes and standards advocacy in 2016 and 2017, whether its shareholders should bear the costs of those advocacy activities, and to address whether any other remedies are appropriate. the scope of this second osc was later expanded to include energy efficiency program years 2014 and 2015, and socalgas' engagement with local governments on proposed reach codes. if the cpuc were to assess fines or penalties on socalgas associated with these oscs, they could have a material adverse effect on socalgas' and sempra energy's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we expect cpuc decisions on these oscs in the first half of 2021.
sempra texas utilities oncor relies on external financing as a significant source of liquidity for its capital requirements. in the past, oncor has financed a substantial portion of its cash needs from operations and with proceeds from indebtedness. in the event that oncor fails to meet its capital requirements or is unable to access sufficient capital to finance its ongoing needs, we may elect to make additional capital contributions to oncor (as our commitments to the puct prohibit us from making loans to oncor) which could be substantial and which would reduce the cash available to us for other purposes, could increase our indebtedness and could ultimately materially adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and prospects.
oncor's ability to pay dividends may be limited by factors such as its credit ratings, regulatory capital requirements, debt-to-equity ratio approved by the puct and other restrictions. in addition, oncor will not pay dividends if a majority of oncor's independent directors or any minority member director determines it is in the best interests of oncor to retain such amounts to meet expected future requirements.
sempra mexico construction projects and related regulatory matters sempra mexico is currently constructing additional terminals for the receipt, storage, and delivery of liquid fuels in the vicinity of mexico city, puebla, veracruz and topolobampo. sempra mexico is also constructing a new solar facility (border solar) in juárez, chihuahua, through which it intends to supply renewable energy to several private companies. sempra mexico is currently developing additional terminals for the receipt, storage, and delivery of liquid fuels in the vicinity of manzanillo, guadalajara and ensenada. we expect to fund these capital expenditures, investments and operations at ienova with available funds, including credit facilities, and funds internally generated by the sempra mexico businesses, as well as funds from project financing, sales of securities, interim funding from the parent or affiliates, and partnering in jvs. we expect the projects under construction to commence commercial operations on various dates in 2021. however, expected commencement dates could be delayed by worsening or extended disruptions of project construction or development caused by the covid-19 pandemic or other factors outside our control. sempra mexico is continuing to monitor the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on cash flows and results of operations. see "part i - item 1a. risk factors."
as we discuss in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, in the second quarter of 2020, certain mexican governmental agencies issued orders and regulations that would reduce or limit the renewable energy sector's participation in the country's energy market. those orders would, among other things, create barriers for renewable energy facilities to enter the wholesale electricity market, prevent renewable energy projects currently in construction from reaching operations and increase grid fees for legacy renewables and cogeneration energy contract holders. ienova and other companies affected by such measures, certain non-governmental environmental organizations or advocacy groups, and cofece, mexico's antitrust regulator, have filed legal complaints with the respective mexican courts to prevent such measures from going into effect. in most cases, the courts have sided with the complainants and such measures have been stayed temporarily. the court-ordered injunctions provide relief until mexico's federal district court ultimately resolves the amparo claims (constitutional protection lawsuits).
an unfavorable final decision on these amparo challenges, or the potential for an extended dispute, could impact our ability to successfully complete construction of our border solar project, which is not yet commercially operating, or to complete such construction in a timely manner and within expected budgets, may impact our ability to operate our wind and solar facilities already in service at existing levels or at all, and may adversely affect our ability to develop new projects, any of which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows and our ability to recover the carrying values of our renewable energy investments in mexico.
the ability to successfully complete major construction projects is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, see "part i - item 1a. risk factors."
other legal and regulatory matters as we discuss in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, ienova received force majeure payments for the guaymas-el oro segment of the sonora pipeline from august 2017 to august 2019. under an agreement between ienova and the cfe, the cfe will resume making payments only when the damaged section of the guaymas-el oro segment of the sonora pipeline is repaired. if the pipeline is not repaired by march 14, 2021 and the parties do not agree on a new service start date, ienova retains the right to terminate the contract and seek to recover its reasonable and documented costs and lost profits. if ienova is unable to make such repairs (which have not commenced) and resume operations in the guaymas-el oro segment of the sonora pipeline or if ienova terminates the contract and is unable to obtain recovery, there may be a material adverse impact on sempra energy's results of operations and cash flows and our ability to recover the carrying value of our investment. at december 31, 2020, the guaymas-el oro segment of the sonora pipeline had a net book value of $447 million. the sasabe-puerto libertad-guaymas segment of the sonora pipeline remains in full operation and is not impacted by these developments.
in may 2020, the two third-party capacity customers at the eca regas facility, shell mexico and gazprom, asserted that a 2019 update of the general terms and conditions for service at the facility, as approved by the cre, resulted in a breach of contract by ienova and a force majeure event. citing these circumstances, the customers subsequently stopped making payments of amounts due under their respective lng storage and regasification agreements. ienova has rejected the customers' assertions and has drawn (and expects to continue to draw) on the customers' letters of credit provided as payment security. the parties engaged in discussions under the applicable contractual dispute resolution procedures without coming to a mutually acceptable resolution. in july 2020, shell mexico submitted a request for arbitration of the dispute and although gazprom has joined the proceeding, gazprom has replenished the amounts drawn on its letter of credit and has resumed making regular monthly payments under its lng storage and regasification agreement. ienova intends to avail itself of its available claims, defenses, rights and remedies in the arbitration proceeding, including seeking dismissal of the customers' claims. in addition to the arbitration proceeding, shell mexico also filed a constitutional challenge to the cre's approval of the update to the general terms and conditions. in october 2020, shell mexico's request to stay cre's approval was denied and, subsequently, shell mexico filed an appeal of that decision.
potential acquisition of esj as we discuss in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, in february 2021, ienova agreed to acquire saavi energía's 50% interest in esj for approximately $83 million. at december 31, 2020, ienova owned a 50% interest in esj, which is accounted for as an equity method investment. upon completion of the acquisition, ienova will own 100% of esj and will consolidate it. we expect to complete the acquisition in the first half of 2021, subject to various closing conditions, including authorizations from the ferc and cofece.
esj is constructing a second wind power generation facility, which we expect will be completed in late 2021 or in the first quarter of 2022 and will have a nameplate capacity of 108 mw.
exchange offer on december 2, 2020, we announced a non-binding offer to acquire up to 100% of the publicly held shares of ienova in exchange for shares of our common stock at an exchange ratio of 0.0313 shares of our common stock for each one ienova ordinary share, which exchange ratio remains subject to approval by the sempra energy board of directors. we expect to complete this transaction in the second quarter of 2021, subject to authorization by the sec, cnbv and mexican stock exchange and other closing conditions. this proposed transaction is subject to a number of risks that we discuss in "part i - item 1a. risk factors."
ienova common stock repurchase fund in april 2020, ienova's shareholders approved an increase to a previously approved fund for ienova to repurchase shares of its common stock for a maximum amount of $500 million, increased from $250 million. as of february 25, 2021, ienova has repurchased 81,742,780 shares of its outstanding common stock held by nci for approximately $248 million since the inception of the fund in 2018, increasing sempra energy's ownership interest in ienova from 66.6% to 70.2% over this period. ienova does not intend to repurchase shares of its common stock during the pendency of the exchange offer described above. following the completion of the exchange offer, ienova may repurchase shares under the existing program from time-to-time at the discretion of management.
sempra lng sempra lng is pursuing development of additional lng export facilities on the gulf coast and pacific coast of north america through its proposed cameron lng jv phase 2 liquefaction expansion project in louisiana, eca lng liquefaction export projects in mexico, and port arthur lng liquefaction export project in texas. we expect sempra lng to require funding for the development and expansion of its portfolio of projects, which may be financed through a combination of operating cash flows, funding from the parent, project financing and participating in jvs.
sempra lng, through its 50.2% interest in cameron lng jv, operates a three-train natural gas liquefaction facility with an export capacity of 12 mtpa of lng, which we refer to as phase 1. the majority of the construction was project-financed at the jv, with most or all of the remainder of the capital requirements provided by the project partners, including sempra energy, through equity contributions under the project equity agreements. cameron lng jv achieved commercial operations of train 1, train 2 and train 3 under its tolling agreements in august 2019, february 2020 and august 2020, respectively.
as we discuss below in "off-balance sheet arrangements" and in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, sempra energy has guaranteed a maximum of $4.0 billion related to cameron lng jv's project financing and financing-related agreements for the phase 1 project. these guarantees terminate upon cameron lng jv achieving "financial completion" of the phase 1 three-train liquefaction export project, including all three trains achieving commercial operation and meeting certain operational performance tests, which are currently underway. cameron lng jv's financing agreements contain events of default customary for such financings, including a failure to achieve financial completion of the project by a deadline of september 30, 2021 (with up to an additional 365 days extension beyond such date permitted in cases of force majeure). pursuant to the financing agreements, cameron lng jv is restricted from making distributions to its project owners, including sempra lng, from january 1, 2021 until the earlier of september 30, 2021 and the achievement of financial completion, at which time any deferred distributions will be released. a delay that results in a failure to achieve financial completion by september 30, 2021 would result in an event of default under cameron lng jv's financing agreements and a potential demand on sempra energy's guarantees. we anticipate that the guarantees will be terminated in the first half of 2021, but this timing could be delayed, perhaps substantially, if the operational performance tests required to achieve financial completion are not completed due to weather-related events, other events or other factors beyond our control. if, due to cameron lng jv's failure to satisfy the financial completion criteria by the applicable deadline, we are required to repay some or all of the $4.0 billion under our guarantees, any such repayments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects.
for a discussion of our investment in cameron lng jv, jv financing, sempra energy guarantees, the risks discussed above and other risks relating to the cameron lng jv phase 1 liquefaction export project that could adversely affect our future performance, see "part i - item 1a. risk factors."
cameron lng jv has received the major permits and fta and non-fta approvals necessary to expand the current configuration of the cameron lng jv liquefaction project beyond phase 1. the permits obtained for the phase 2 project include up to two additional liquefaction trains and up to two additional full containment lng storage tanks (one of which was permitted with the phase 1 three-train project).
sempra energy has entered mous with total se, mitsui & co., ltd. and mitsubishi corporation that provide a framework for cooperation for the development of and 100% of the offtake from the potential cameron lng jv phase 2 project. the ultimate participation of and offtake by total se, mitsui & co., ltd. and mitsubishi corporation remains subject to negotiation and finalization of definitive agreements, among other factors, and total se, mitsui & co., ltd. and mitsubishi corporation have no commitment to participate in or enter into offtake agreements with the phase 2 project until such definitive agreements are established.
expansion of the cameron lng jv liquefaction facility beyond the first three trains is subject to certain restrictions and conditions under the jv project financing agreements, including among others, timing restrictions on expansion of the project unless appropriate prior consent is obtained from the phase 1 project lenders. under the cameron lng jv equity agreements, the expansion of the project requires the unanimous consent of all the partners, including with respect to the equity investment obligation of each partner. discussions among all the cameron lng jv partners have been taking place regarding how an expansion may be structured and we expect that discussions will continue. there is no assurance that the cameron lng jv members will unanimously agree in a timely manner or at all on an expansion structure, which, if not accomplished, would materially and adversely impact the development of the phase 2 expansion project. in light of this and other considerations, we are unable to predict whether or when cameron lng jv might be able to move forward on the phase 2 expansion of the cameron lng jv liquefaction facility beyond the first three trains.
the development of the potential cameron lng jv phase 2 expansion project is subject to numerous other risks and uncertainties, including securing binding customer commitments; reaching unanimous agreement with our partners to proceed; obtaining a number of permits and regulatory approvals; securing financing; negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements, including a definitive epc contract, equity acquisition and governance agreements; reaching a final investment decision; and other factors associated with this potential investment. for a discussion of these risks, see "part i - item 1a. risk factors."
eca lng liquefaction export projects sempra lng and ienova are developing two natural gas liquefaction export projects at ienova's existing eca regas facility. the liquefaction export projects, which are planned for development in two phases (a mid-scale project referred to as eca lng phase 1 and a proposed large-scale project referred to as eca lng phase 2), are being developed to provide buyers with direct access to north american west coast lng supplies. we do not expect the construction of the eca lng phase 1 project to disrupt operations at the eca regas facility. however, construction of the eca lng phase 2 project would conflict with the current operations at the eca regas facility, which currently has long-term regasification contracts for 100% of the regasification facility's capacity through 2028, making the decisions on whether and how to pursue the eca lng phase 2 project dependent in part on whether the investment in a large-scale liquefaction facility would, over the long term, be more beneficial financially than continuing to supply regasification services under our existing contracts. we have planned measures to not disrupt operations at the eca regas facility with the construction of the eca lng phase 1 project.
in march 2019, eca lng received two authorizations from the doe to export u.s.-produced natural gas to mexico and to re-export lng to non-fta countries from its eca lng phase 1 project, which is a one-train natural gas liquefaction facility with a nameplate capacity of 3.25 mtpa and initial offtake capacity of approximately 2.5 mtpa that is under construction, and its proposed eca lng phase 2 project that is in development.
in april 2020, eca lng phase 1 executed definitive 20-year lng sale and purchase agreements with mitsui & co., ltd. for approximately 0.8 mtpa of lng and with an affiliate of total se for approximately 1.7 mtpa of lng. in december 2020, an affiliate of total se acquired a 16.6% ownership interest in eca lng phase 1, with sempra lng and ienova each retaining a 41.7% ownership interest. our mou with mitsui & co., ltd. provides a framework for mitsui & co., ltd.'s potential offtake of lng from, and potential acquisition of an equity interest in, eca lng phase 2.
in february 2020, we entered into an epc contract with technipfmc for the engineering, procurement and construction of the eca lng phase 1 project. since reaching a final investment decision with respect to the project in november 2020, we released technipfmc to commence work to construct the eca lng phase 1 project. the total price of the epc contract is estimated at approximately $1.5 billion. we estimate that capital expenditures will approximate $2.0 billion, including capitalized interest and project contingency. the actual cost of the epc contract and the actual amount of these capital expenditures may differ, perhaps substantially, from our estimates.
the construction of the eca lng phase 1 project and the development of the potential eca lng phase 2 project are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. for phase 1, these include maintaining permits and regulatory approvals; construction delays; securing and maintaining commercial arrangements, such as gas supply and transportation agreements; and other factors associated with the project and its construction. for phase 2, these include obtaining binding customer commitments; the receipt of a number of permits and regulatory approvals; obtaining financing; negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements, including a definitive epc contract, equity acquisition and governance agreements, lng sales agreements and gas supply and transportation agreements; reaching a final investment decision; and other factors associated with this potential investment. in addition, as we discuss in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, an unfavorable decision on certain property disputes or permit challenges, or an extended dispute with existing customers at the eca regas facility, could materially and adversely affect the development of these projects and sempra energy's financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects, including the impairment of all or a substantial portion of the capital costs invested in the projects to date. for a discussion of these risks, see "part i - item 1a. risk factors."
port arthur lng liquefaction export project sempra lng is developing a proposed natural gas liquefaction export project on a greenfield site that it owns in the vicinity of port arthur, texas, located along the sabine-neches waterway. sempra lng received authorizations from the doe in august 2015 and may 2019 that collectively permit the lng to be produced from the proposed port arthur lng project to be exported to all current and future fta and non-fta countries.
in april 2019, the ferc approved the siting, construction and operation of the proposed port arthur lng liquefaction facility, along with certain natural gas pipelines, including the louisiana connector and texas connector pipelines, that could be used to supply feed gas to the liquefaction facility, assuming the project is completed. in february 2020, sempra lng filed a ferc application for the siting, construction and operation of a second phase at the proposed port arthur lng facility, including the potential addition of two liquefaction trains.
in february 2020, we entered into an epc contract with bechtel for the proposed port arthur lng liquefaction project. the epc contract contemplates the construction of two liquefaction trains with a nameplate capacity of approximately 13.5 mtpa, two lng storage tanks, a marine berth and associated loading facilities and related infrastructure necessary to provide liquefaction services. we have no obligation to move forward on the epc contract, and we may release bechtel to perform portions of the work pursuant to limited notices to proceed. we plan to fully release bechtel to perform all of the work to construct the port arthur lng liquefaction export project only after we reach a final investment decision with respect to the project and after certain other conditions are met, including obtaining project financing. in december 2020, we amended and restated the epc contract to reflect an estimated price of approximately $8.7 billion, depending on the timing of a full notice to proceed, which, if not issued by july 15, 2021, will require renegotiation of the epc contract. any changes to the epc contract will require the agreement of both parties, which cannot be assured.
in december 2018, polish oil & gas company (pgnig) and port arthur lng entered into a definitive 20-year agreement for the sale and purchase of 2 mtpa of lng per year from the port arthur lng liquefaction export project. under the agreement, lng purchases by pgnig from port arthur lng will be made on a free-on-board basis, with pgnig responsible for shipping the lng from the port arthur facility to the final destination. port arthur lng will manage the gas pipeline transportation, liquefaction processing and cargo loading. the agreement is subject to certain conditions precedent, including port arthur lng making a positive final investment decision within certain agreed timelines. the failure of these conditions precedent to be satisfied or waived within the agreed timelines could result in the termination of the agreement.
in may 2019, aramco services company and sempra lng signed a heads of agreement for the negotiation of a definitive 20-year lng sale and purchase agreement for 5 mtpa of lng offtake from the port arthur lng liquefaction export project. the heads of agreement also includes the negotiation of a potential 25% equity investment in the project. in january 2020, aramco services company and sempra lng signed an interim project participation agreement, which sets forth certain mechanisms for the parties to work towards receipt of corporate approvals to enter into and proceed with the transaction, execution of the transaction agreements and the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions precedent contemplated by these agreements, making a final investment decision and other pre-final investment decision activities. the heads of agreement and interim project participation agreement do not obligate the parties to ultimately execute any agreements or participate in the project.
development of the port arthur lng liquefaction export project is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including obtaining additional customer commitments; completing the required commercial agreements, such as equity acquisitions and governance agreements, lng sales agreements and gas supply and transportation agreements; completing construction contracts; securing all necessary permits and approvals; obtaining financing and incentives; reaching a final investment decision; and other factors associated with the potential investment. an unfavorable outcome with respect to any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on sempra energy's financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including the impairment of all or a substantial portion of the capital costs invested in the project to date. for a discussion of these risks, see "part i - item 1a. risk factors."
proposed sempra infrastructure partners transaction in december 2020, we announced our intention to sell nci in sempra infrastructure partners, which represents the combined businesses of sempra lng and ienova. we expect to complete this transaction in the second quarter of 2021. we intend to use the expected proceeds from the proposed sale of nci to fund capital investments to support additional growth opportunities and strengthen our balance sheet by reducing debt.
the proposed sale of nci in sempra infrastructure partners will reduce our ownership interest in sempra infrastructure partners. any decrease in our ownership of sempra infrastructure partners would also decrease our share of the cash flows, profits and other benefits these businesses currently or may in the future produce, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and/or prospects.
our ability to complete this transaction is subject to a number of risks, including, among others, the ability to identify a suitable partner to purchase such nci; negotiate the terms of equity sale, shareholder and other governance agreements with such partner; and obtain governmental, regulatory and third-party consents and approvals and satisfy any other closing conditions to complete this transaction. although the structure and terms of this transaction remain to be determined, the governmental and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the transaction could seek to block or challenge it or could impose requirements or obligations as conditions to its approval. if any of these circumstances were to occur, or if we are not able to achieve all of the foregoing in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms, then the proposed transaction may be abandoned and our prospects could be materially adversely affected. this transaction is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that we discuss further in "part i - item 1a. risk factors."
discontinued operations in april 2020, we completed the sale of our equity interests in our peruvian businesses for cash proceeds of $3,549 million, net of transaction costs and as adjusted for post-closing adjustments. in june 2020, we completed the sale of our equity interests in our chilean businesses for cash proceeds of $2,216 million, net of transaction costs and as adjusted for post-closing adjustments.
our utilities in south america historically provided relatively stable earnings and liquidity. we used a portion of the proceeds from the sales of these businesses to strengthen our balance sheet by repaying certain borrowings and repurchasing shares of our common stock, and we intend to use the remaining proceeds to focus on capital investment in north america to support additional growth opportunities. we expect the cash provided by earnings from our capital investments will exceed the absence of cash flows from these discontinued operations. however, there is no assurance that we will derive these anticipated benefits. further, there is no assurance that we will be able to redeploy the capital that we obtained from such sales in a way that results in cash flows or earnings exceeding those historically generated by these businesses.

expenditures for pp&e we invest the majority of our capital expenditures in the california utilities, primarily for transmission and distribution improvements, including pipeline and wildfire safety. the following table summarizes by segment capital expenditures for the last three years.
expenditures for pp&amp;e
expenditures for investments and acquisitions in 2019 and 2018, we invested heavily in our sempra texas utilities, which included our march 2018 acquisition of oncor holdings and subsequent contributions to oncor holdings, primarily to fund oncor's purchase of infrareit in may 2019. the following table summarizes by segment our investments in various jvs, as well as business and asset acquisitions.

future capital expenditures and investments the amounts and timing of capital expenditures and certain investments are generally subject to approvals by various regulatory and other governmental and environmental bodies, including the cpuc, the ferc and the puct, and various other factors described in this md&a and in "part i - item 1a. risk factors." in 2021, we expect to make capital expenditures and investments of approximately $5.8 billion (which excludes capital expenditures that will be funded by unconsolidated entities), as summarized by segment in the following table.
future capital expenditures and investments
sempra texas utilities                          200
we expect the majority of our capital expenditures and investments in 2021 will relate to transmission and distribution improvements at our regulated public utilities, the eca lng phase 1 liquefaction export project at sempra lng and construction of liquid fuels terminals at sempra mexico.
from 2021 through 2025, and subject to the factors described below, which could cause these estimates to vary substantially, sempra energy expects to make aggregate capital expenditures and investments of approximately $22.5 billion (which excludes capital expenditures that will be funded by unconsolidated entities), as follows: $9.6 billion at sdg&e, $9.2 billion at socalgas, $0.6 billion at sempra texas utilities, $1.1 billion at sempra mexico and $2.0 billion at sempra lng. capital expenditure amounts include capitalized interest and afudc related to debt.
periodically, we review our construction, investment and financing programs and revise them in response to changes in regulation, economic conditions, competition, customer growth, inflation, customer rates, the cost and availability of capital, and safety and environmental requirements.
our level of capital expenditures and investments in the next few years may vary substantially and will depend on, among other things, the cost and availability of financing, regulatory approvals, changes in u.s. federal tax law and business opportunities providing desirable rates of return. see "part i - item 1a. risk factors" for a discussion of other factors that could affect future levels of our capital expenditures and investments. we intend to finance our capital expenditures in a manner that will maintain our investment-grade credit ratings and capital structure, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so.
capital stock transactions sempra energy cash provided by issuances of common and preferred stock was:
sempra energy series c preferred stock offering. in june 2020, we issued 900,000 shares of our series c preferred stock in a registered public offering at a price to the public of $1,000 per share and received net proceeds of $889 million after deducting the underwriting discount and equity issuance costs of $11 million. we used the net proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including the repayment of indebtedness. we provide additional discussion about this equity offering in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
sempra energy common stock repurchase program. as we discuss in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, in 2020, we entered into and completed an asr program under which we paid $500 million to repurchase 4,089,375 shares of our common stock at an average price of $122.27 per share. we funded the $500 million share repurchase with a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of our south american businesses.
on february 23, 2021, our board of directors approved an increase in sempra energy's quarterly common stock dividend to $1.10 per share ($4.40 annually), the first of which is payable april 15, 2021. in addition, on february 23, 2021, our board of directors declared quarterly dividends of $1.6875 per share on our series b preferred stock and semi-annual dividends of $24.375 per share on our series c preferred stock, both payable on april 15, 2021. all declarations of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock are made at the discretion of the board of directors. while we view dividends as an integral component of shareholder return, the amount of future dividends will depend on earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements, and other relevant factors at that time. as a result, sempra energy's dividends on common stock declared on an annual historical basis, including recent historical increases, may not be indicative of future declarations.
sdg&e in 2020 and 2018, sdg&e paid common stock dividends to enova and enova paid corresponding dividends to sempra energy of $200 million and $250 million, respectively. sdg&e did not declare or pay common stock dividends in 2019. sdg&e's dividends on common stock declared on an annual historical basis may not be indicative of future declarations and could be impacted over the next few years in order for sdg&e to maintain its authorized capital structure while managing its capital investment program.
socalgas in 2020, 2019 and 2018, socalgas paid common stock dividends to pe and pe paid corresponding dividends to sempra energy of $100 million, $150 million and $50 million, respectively. socalgas' dividends on common stock declared on an annual historical basis may not be indicative of future declarations and could be impacted over the next few years in order for socalgas to maintain its authorized capital structure while managing its capital investment program.
dividend restrictions the board of directors for each of sempra energy, sdg&e and socalgas has the discretion to determine whether to declare and, if declared, the amount of any dividends by each such entity. the cpuc's regulation of sdg&e's and socalgas' capital structures limits the amounts that are available for loans and dividends to sempra energy. at december 31, 2020, based on these regulations, sempra energy could have received combined loans and dividends of approximately $717 million from sdg&e and $148 million from socalgas.
we provide additional information about dividend restrictions in "restricted net assets" in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.

the tables also exclude income tax liabilities at december 31, 2020 of:
▪$68 million for socalgas these liabilities relate to uncertain tax positions and were excluded from the tables because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of future payments due to uncertainties in the effective settlement of tax positions. we provide additional information about unrecognized income tax benefits in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
we have bilateral unsecured standby letter of credit capacity with select lenders that is uncommitted and supported by reimbursement agreements. at december 31, 2020, we had approximately $508 million in standby letters of credit outstanding under these agreements.
off-balance sheet arrangements in august 2014 and december 2019, sempra energy provided guarantees for 50.2% of cameron lng jv's financing obligations for a maximum amount of up to $4.0 billion. the guarantees will terminate upon satisfaction of certain conditions, including all three trains achieving financial completion by september 30, 2021 (with up to an additional 365-day extension beyond such date permitted in cases of force majeure). however, if cameron lng jv fails to satisfy the financial completion criteria, a demand could be made under the guarantee for sempra energy's 50.2% share of cameron lng jv's obligations under the financing arrangements then due and payable, which could have a material adverse impact on sempra energy's liquidity. we discuss these guarantees above in "overview - sempra lng - cameron lng jv three-train liquefaction project (phase 1)," in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and "part i - item 1a. risk factors."
in july 2020, sempra energy entered into a support agreement, which contains a guarantee and represents a variable interest, for the benefit of cfin with a maximum exposure to loss of $979 million. the guarantee will terminate upon full repayment of the guaranteed debt by 2039, including repayment following an event in which the guaranteed debt is put to sempra energy. we discuss this guarantee in notes 1, 6 and 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies and estimates management views certain accounting policies as critical because their application is the most relevant, judgmental, and/or material to our financial position and results of operations, and/or because they require the use of material judgments and estimates.
we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. we discuss choices among alternative accounting policies that are material to our financial statements and information concerning significant estimates with the audit committee of the sempra energy board of directors.
contingencies sempra energy, sdg&e, socalgas we accrue losses for the estimated impacts of various conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes. for loss contingencies, we accrue the loss if an event has occurred on or before the balance sheet date and:
▪information available through the date we file our financial statements indicates it is probable that a loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of uncertain future events
▪the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we do not accrue contingencies that might result in gains. we continuously assess contingencies for litigation claims, environmental remediation and other events.
regulatory accounting sempra energy, sdg&e, socalgas as regulated entities, the california utilities' customer rates, as set and monitored by regulators, are designed to recover the cost of providing service and provide the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investments. the california utilities record regulatory assets, which are generally costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it is probable that, through the ratemaking process, the utility will recover that asset from customers in future rates. similarly, regulatory liabilities are recorded for amounts recovered in rates in advance or in excess of costs incurred. the california utilities assess probabilities of future rate recovery associated with regulatory account balances at the end of each reporting period and whenever new and/or unusual events occur, such as:
▪changes in the regulatory and political environment or the utility's competitive position
▪passage of new legislation to the extent that circumstances associated with regulatory balances change, the regulatory balances are evaluated and adjusted if appropriate.
adverse legislative or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of our regulatory assets and liabilities and could materially adversely impact our financial statements. details of the california utilities' regulatory assets and liabilities and additional factors that management considers when assessing probabilities associated with regulatory balances are discussed in notes 1, 4, 15 and 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
income taxes sempra energy, sdg&e, socalgas our income tax expense and related balance sheet amounts involve significant management judgments and estimates. amounts of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as current and noncurrent accruals, involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income and deductions by taxing authorities. when we evaluate the anticipated resolution of income tax issues, we consider:
▪positions taken by taxing authorities with other taxpayers with similar issues the likelihood of deferred income tax recovery is based on analyses of the deferred income tax assets and our expectation of future taxable income, based on our strategic planning.
▪future impacts of various items, including changes in tax laws, regulations, interpretations and rulings
▪our financial condition in future periods
▪the resolution of various income tax issues between us and taxing and regulatory authorities for an uncertain position to qualify for benefit recognition, the position must have at least a more-likely-than-not chance of being sustained (based on the position's technical merits) upon challenge by the respective authorities. the term more-likely-than-not means a likelihood of more than 50%. if we do not have a more-likely-than-not position with respect to a tax position, then we do not recognize any of the potential tax benefit associated with the position. a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon the effective resolution of the tax position.
unrecognized tax benefits involve management's judgment regarding the likelihood of the benefit being sustained. the final resolution of uncertain tax positions could result in adjustments to recorded amounts and may affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
we discuss details of our issues in this area and additional information related to accounting for income taxes, including uncertainty in income taxes, in note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
derivatives and hedge accounting sempra energy, sdg&e, socalgas we record derivative instruments for which we do not apply a scope exception at fair value on the balance sheet. depending on the purpose for the contract and the applicability of hedge or regulatory accounting, the changes in fair value of derivatives may be recorded in earnings, on the balance sheet, or in oci. we also use the normal purchase or sale exception for certain derivative contracts. whenever possible, we use exchange quoted prices or other third-party pricing to estimate fair values; if no such data is available, we use internally developed models and other techniques. the assumed collectability of derivative assets considers events specific to a given counterparty, the counterparty's credit worthiness, and the tenor of the transaction.
the application of hedge accounting and normal purchase or sale accounting for certain derivatives is determined on a contract-by-contract basis. significant changes in assumptions in our cash flow hedges, such as the amount and/or timing of forecasted transactions, could cause unrealized gains or losses (mark-to-market) to be reclassified out of aoci to earnings, which may materially impact our results of operations. additionally, changes in assumed physical delivery on contracts for which we elected normal purchase or sale accounting may result in "tainting" of the election, which may (1) preclude us from making this election in future transactions and (2) impact sempra energy's results of operations. the impacts of derivatives and hedge accounting on the california utilities' results of operations are typically not significant because regulatory accounting principles generally apply to their contracts. we provide details of our derivative instruments and our fair value approaches in notes 11 and 12, respectively, of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
pension and other postretirement benefit plans sempra energy, sdg&e, socalgas to measure our pension and other postretirement obligations, costs and liabilities, we rely on several assumptions. we consider current market conditions, including interest rates, in making these assumptions. we review these assumptions annually and update when appropriate.
the critical assumptions used to develop the required estimates include the following key factors:
▪mortality rates
▪utilization of postretirement welfare benefits
▪payout elections (lump sum or annuity)
▪changing market and economic conditions
▪higher or lower withdrawal rates
▪more or fewer lump sum versus annuity payout elections made by plan participants
▪higher or lower retirement rates these differences, other than those related to the california utilities' plans, where rate recovery offsets the effects of the assumptions on earnings, may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense we record. for plans other than those at the california utilities, the approximate annual effect on earnings of a 100 bps increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate would be less than $1 million and the effect of a 100 bps increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would be less than $2 million. we provide details of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
asset retirement obligations sempra energy, sdg&e sdg&e's legal aros related to the decommissioning of songs are estimated based on a site-specific study performed no less than every three years. the estimate of the obligations includes:
▪discount rate based on a credit-adjusted risk-free rate
▪actual decommissioning costs, progress to date and expected duration of decommissioning activities changes in the estimated decommissioning costs, or in the assumptions and judgments made by management underlying these estimates, could cause revisions to the estimated total cost associated with retiring the assets. sdg&e's nuclear decommissioning expenses are subject to rate recovery and, therefore, rate-making accounting treatment is applied to sdg&e's nuclear decommissioning activities. sdg&e recognizes a regulatory asset, or liability, to the extent that its songs aro exceeds, or is less than, the amount collected from customers and the amount earned in sdg&e's ndt.
we provide additional detail in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
▪a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use an asset or in its physical condition;
▪a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection of continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset; and
▪a current expectation that, more-likely-than-not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
if an impairment test is required, the fair value of a long-lived asset can vary if differing estimates and assumptions are used in the valuation techniques applied as indicated by changing market or other conditions. we discuss impairment of long-lived assets in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
impairment testing of goodwill sempra energy on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation, we consider whether goodwill may be impaired. for our annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative goodwill impairment test. if we elect to perform the qualitative assessment, we evaluate relevant events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, changes in key personnel and the overall financial performance of the reporting unit. if, after assessing these qualitative factors, we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. if, after performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we determine that goodwill is impaired, we record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
when determining if goodwill is impaired, the fair value of the reporting unit can vary if differing estimates and assumptions are used in the valuation techniques applied as indicated by changing market or other conditions. as a result, recognizing a goodwill impairment may or may not be required. when we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we exercise judgment to develop estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit and compare that to its carrying value. our fair value estimates are developed from the perspective of a knowledgeable market participant. we consider observable transactions in the marketplace for similar investments, if available, as well as an income-based approach such as a discounted cash flow analysis. a discounted cash flow analysis may be based directly on anticipated future revenues and expenses and may be performed based on free cash flows generated within the reporting unit. critical assumptions that affect our estimates of fair value may include:
▪entity risk in 2020, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test and determined that the estimated fair values of our reporting units in mexico to which goodwill was allocated was substantially above their carrying values as of october 1, 2020, our goodwill impairment testing date. we discuss goodwill in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
carrying value of equity method investments sempra energy we generally account for investments under the equity method when we have significant influence over, but do not have control of, the investee.
we consider whether the fair value of each equity investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. to help evaluate whether a decline in fair value below carrying value has occurred and if the decline is other than temporary, we may develop fair value estimates for the investment. our fair value estimates are developed from the perspective of a knowledgeable market participant. in the absence of observable transactions in the marketplace for similar investments, we consider an income-based approach such as a discounted cash flow analysis or, with less weighting, the replacement cost of the underlying net assets. a discounted cash flow analysis may be based directly on anticipated future distributions from the investment, or may be performed based on free cash flows generated within the entity and adjusted for our ownership share total. for certain investments, critical assumptions may include, but are not limited to, transportation rates for natural gas, the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate and the availability and costs of natural gas and lng.
in addition, for our indirect investment in oncor, critical assumptions may also include the effects of ratemaking, such as the results of regulator decisions on rates and recovery of regulated investments and costs. the risk assumptions applied by other market participants to value the investments could vary significantly or the appropriate approaches could be weighted differently. these differences could impact whether or not the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value, and if so, whether that condition is other than temporary. this could result in an impairment charge and, in cases where an impairment charge has been recorded, additional loss or gain upon sale in the case of a sale transaction.
we provide additional details in notes 6 and 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.

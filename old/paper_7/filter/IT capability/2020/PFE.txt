pfizer inc.       2020 form 10-k references to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. although foreign exchange rate changes are part of our business, they are not within our control and since they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting operational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.
our business and strategy most of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. with the formation of the consumer healthcare jv in 2019 and the completion of the spin-off and combination of our upjohn business with mylan in november 2020, pfizer has transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines. we now operate as a single operating segment engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the financial results of the upjohn business and the mylan-japan collaboration are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. prior-period information has been restated to reflect our current organizational structure following the separation of the upjohn business. see note 1a and item 1. business--commercial operations of this form 10-k for additional information. we expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating upjohn, of which, approximately 70% has been incurred since inception and through december 31, 2020. these charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.
transforming to a more focused company: we have undertaken efforts to ensure our cost base aligns appropriately with our revenue base. while certain direct costs transferred to the consumer healthcare jv and to the upjohn business in connection with the spin-off, there are indirect costs which did not transfer. in addition, we are taking steps to restructure our corporate enabling functions to appropriately support and drive the purpose of our focused innovative biopharmaceutical products business and r&d and pgs platform functions. see the costs and expenses--restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives section of this md&a.
r&d: we believe we have a strong pipeline and are well-positioned for future growth. r&d is at the heart of fulfilling our purpose to deliver breakthroughs that change patients' lives as we work to translate advanced science and technologies into the therapies that may be the most impactful for patients. innovation, drug discovery and development are critical to our success. in addition to discovering and developing new products, our r&d efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications. see the item 1. business-research and development section of this form 10-k for our r&d priorities and strategy.
we seek to leverage a strong pipeline, organize around expected operational growth drivers and capitalize on trends creating long-term growth opportunities, including:
•an aging global population that is generating increased demand for innovative medicines and vaccines that address patients' unmet needs;
•advances in both biological science and digital technology that are enhancing the delivery of breakthrough new medicines and vaccines; and
•the increasingly significant role of hospitals in healthcare systems.
we are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, as well as through various business development activities. we view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing opportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and our capabilities. we assess our business, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities that will advance our business. for additional information, including discussion of recent significant business development activities, see note 2.
our 2020 performance revenues revenues increased $736 million, or 2%, to $41.9 billion in 2020 from $41.2 billion in 2019, reflecting an operational increase of $1.1 billion, or 3%, and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $331 million, or 1%.
excluding the impact of the consumer healthcare transaction, revenues increased 8% operationally, reflecting strong growth in vyndaqel/vyndamax, eliquis, ibrance outside developed europe, inlyta, xeljanz, xtandi, prevenar 13 outside the u.s., oncology biosimilars and certain products in the hospital therapeutic area in the u.s., partially offset by enbrel internationally and prevnar 13 and chantix in the u.s. revenues for 2020 included an estimated unfavorable impact of approximately $700 million, or 2%, due to covid-19, primarily reflecting lower demand for certain products in china and unfavorable disruptions to wellness visits for patients in the u.s., which negatively impacted prescribing patterns for certain products, partially offset by increased u.s. demand for certain sterile injectable products and increased adult uptake for prevenar 13 in certain international markets, resulting from greater vaccine awareness for respiratory illnesses, and u.s. revenues for bnt162b2.

our operating environment we, like other businesses in our industry, are subject to certain industry-specific challenges. these include, among others, the topics listed below. see also the item 1. business--government regulation and price constraints section of this form 10-k.
provide data on safety and efficacy to support the evaluation of a drug's overall benefit-risk profile for a particular patient population. in addition, after a product has been approved and launched, we continue to monitor its safety as long as it is available to patients. this includes postmarketing trials that may be conducted voluntarily or pursuant to a regulatory request to gain additional medical knowledge. for the entire life of the product, we collect safety data and report safety information to the fda and other regulatory authorities. regulatory authorities may evaluate potential safety concerns and take regulatory actions in response, such as updating a product's labeling, restricting its use, communicating new safety information to the public, or, in rare cases, requiring us to suspend or remove a product from the market. the commercial potential of in-line products may be negatively impacted by post-marketing developments.
intellectual property rights and collaboration/licensing rights the loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements with manufacturers and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a material adverse effect on our revenues. certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years. for example, the basic product patent for chantix in the u.s. expired in november 2020. also, the basic product patent for sutent in the u.s. will expire in august 2021. while additional patent expiries will continue, we expect a moderate impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries from 2021 through 2025. we continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to ensure appropriate patient access.
for additional information on patent rights we consider most significant to our business as a whole, see the item 1. business--patents and other intellectual property rights section in this form 10-k.
for a discussion of recent developments with respect to patent litigation, see note 16a1.
regulatory environment/pricing and access--u.s. healthcare legislation in march 2010, the aca was enacted in the u.s. we recorded the following amounts to reflect the impact of the aca legislation:
reduction to revenues, related to the medicare "coverage gap" discount provision                                                                   $1,175                                                  $761                                                  $418
selling, informational and administrative expenses, related to the fee payable to the federal government                                              195                                                   210                                                   134
regulatory environment/pricing and access--government and other payer group pressures the pricing of medicines by pharmaceutical manufacturers and the cost of healthcare, which includes medicines, medical services and hospital services, continues to be important to payers, governments, patients, and other stakeholders. federal and state governments and private third-party payers in the u.s. continue to take action to manage the utilization of drugs and cost of drugs, including increasingly employing formularies to control costs by taking into account discounts in connection with decisions about formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement. we consider a number of factors impacting the pricing of our medicines. within the u.s., we often engage with patients, doctors and healthcare plans. we also often provide significant discounts from the list price to insurers, including pbms and mcos. the price that patients pay in the u.s. for prescribed medicines is ultimately set by healthcare providers and insurers. on average, insurers impose a higher out-of-pocket burden on patients for prescription medicines than for comparably priced medical services. certain governments outside the u.s. provide healthcare at low-to-zero direct cost to consumers at the point of care and have significant power as large single payers to effectively regulate prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. governments may use a variety of measures, including proposing pricing reform or legislation, cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access, "international reference pricing" (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), qce processes and vbp. for additional information, see the item 1. business--government regulation and price constraints section in this form 10-k.
the global economic environment in addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses of our size and global extent of activities, are exposed to the economic cycle. certain factors in the global economic environment that may impact our global operations include, among other things, currency fluctuations, capital and exchange controls, global economic conditions, restrictive government actions, changes in intellectual property, legal protections and remedies, trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, and marketing of, reimbursement for and access to our products, as well as impacts of political or civil unrest, terrorist activity, unstable governments and legal systems, inter-governmental disputes and public health outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics. government pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices, access criteria or other means of cost control.
covid-19 pandemic the continuation of the covid-19 pandemic has impacted our business, operations and financial condition and results. for additional information on the impact of covid-19 on our revenues, please see the overview of our performance, operating environment, strategy and outlook-our 2020 performance section of this md&a.
our response to covid-19
we are committed to confronting the public health challenge posed by the pandemic by collaborating with industry partners and academic institutions to develop potential approaches to prevent and treat covid-19. in march 2020, we issued a five-point plan calling on the biopharmaceutical industry to join us in committing to unprecedented collaboration to combat covid-19. subsequently, we have made some important advances, including, among others:
•entry into a global agreement (except for china, hong kong, macau and taiwan) with biontech for the development, manufacture and commercialization of an mrna-based coronavirus vaccine, bnt162, to help prevent covid-19. in november 2020, the companies announced that after conducting the final efficacy analysis in the phase 3 study, bnt162b2 met both of the study's primary efficacy endpoints.
pfizer inc.       2020 form 10-k analysis of the data indicated a vaccine efficacy rate against covid-19 of 95% in participants without prior sars-cov-2 infection (first primary objective) and also in participants with and without prior sars-cov-2 infection (second primary objective), in each case measured from seven days after the second dose. the fda authorized the distribution and use of bnt162b2 in the u.s. to help prevent covid-19 for individuals 16 years of age and older under an eua issued in december 2020. bnt162b2 has not been approved or licensed by the fda. the eua authorizes distribution and use of this product subject to the conditions set forth in the eua, and only for the duration of the declaration by the department of health & human services that circumstances exist justifying authorization of emergency use of drugs and biological products (such as bnt162b2) during the covid-19 pandemic under section 564 of the ffdca (the declaration), or until revocation of the eua by the fda. the fda has issued euas to certain other companies for products intended for the prevention or treatment of covid-19 and may continue to do so during the duration of the declaration. the fda expects eua holders to work towards submission of a bla as soon as possible. bnt162b2 has now been granted a cma, eua or temporary authorization in more than 50 countries worldwide. the companies continue to study bnt162b2, including studies evaluating it in additional populations, booster doses and emerging variants. based on the updated 6-dose labeling and subject to continuous process improvements, expansion at current facilities and adding new suppliers and contract manufacturers, the companies believe that they can potentially manufacture at least 2 billion doses in total by the end of 2021. the companies have entered into agreements to supply pre-specified doses of bnt162b2 with multiple developed and emerging nations around the world and are continuing to deliver doses of bnt162b2 to governments under such agreements. as of february 2, 2021, based on the doses to be delivered in 2021 primarily under agreements entered into as of february 2, 2021 (including, among others, agreements with the u.s. government to supply 200 million doses, the european commission to supply 300 million doses, the japanese government to supply 144 million doses and covid-19 vaccines global access (covax) for up to 40 million doses in 2021, subject to the negotiation and execution of additional agreements under the covax facility structure), we forecasted approximately $15 billion in revenues in 2021 from bnt162b2, with gross margin to be split evenly with biontech. this forecast was based on doses mostly covered under agreements entered into as of february 2, 2021 and did not include all of the doses we can potentially deliver by the end of 2021. the companies continue to enter into agreements with governments for additional doses, including, among others, the exercise by the u.s. government of an option for an additional 100 million doses and an agreement with the european commission for an additional 200 million doses to be delivered in 2021. accordingly, this forecast may change based, in part, on these and future additional agreements that may be signed and as circumstances warrant. for additional information on our covid-19 vaccine development program, see note 2 and the item 1a. risk factors-covid-19 pandemic section in this form 10-k.
•initiation, in september 2020, of a phase 1b clinical trial in hospitalized participants with covid-19 to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a novel investigational protease inhibitor for covid-19, pf-07304814, which is a phosphate prodrug of a 3c-like (3cl) protease inhibitor, pf-00835231.
despite our significant investments and efforts, any of our ongoing development programs related to covid-19 may not be successful as the risk of failure is significant, and there can be no certainty these efforts will yield a successful product or that costs will ultimately be recouped.
impact of covid-19 on our business and operations the following discussion summarizes our current views of key business and operational areas impacted by the pandemic and its effects on our business, operations, and financial condition and results. as part of our on-going monitoring and assessment, we have made certain assumptions regarding the covid-19 pandemic for purposes of our operational planning and financial projections, including assumptions regarding the duration, severity and the global macroeconomic impact of the pandemic, as well as covid-19 vaccine supply and contracts, which remain dynamic. despite careful tracking and planning, we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business, operations and financial condition and results due to the uncertainty of future developments. in particular, we believe the ultimate impact on our business, operations and financial condition and results will be affected by the speed and extent of the continued spread of the coronavirus globally; the emergence of additional virus variants; the duration of the pandemic; new information regarding the severity and incidence of covid-19; the safety, efficacy and availability of vaccines and treatments for covid-19; the rate at which the population becomes vaccinated against covid-19; the global macroeconomic impact of the pandemic and governmental or regulatory actions to contain the virus or control supply of medicines. we are focused on all aspects of our business and are implementing measures aimed at mitigating issues where possible, including by using digital technology to assist in operations for our commercial, manufacturing, r&d and enabling functions globally.
our business and operations have been impacted by the pandemic in various ways. for example:
•at this time, most of our colleagues who are able to perform their job functions outside of our facilities continue to work remotely, while certain colleagues in the pgs and wrdm organizations continue to work onsite and are subject to strict protocols intended to reduce the risk of transmission.
•while engagement with healthcare professionals has started to return to pre-pandemic levels due to our virtual engagement capabilities, our sales force colleagues continue to encounter mixed access as a result of ongoing restrictions on in-person meetings. we are actively reviewing and assessing epidemiological data and our colleagues remain ready to resume in-person engagements with healthcare professionals on a location-by-location basis as soon as it is safe to do so. during the pandemic, we have adapted our promotional platform by amplifying our existing digital capabilities to reach healthcare professionals and customers to provide critical education and information, including increasing the scale of our remote engagement.
•we have not seen a significant disruption to our supply chain to date, and all of our manufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near normal levels.
•after a brief pause to the recruitment portion of certain ongoing clinical studies and a delay to most new study starts, we restarted recruitment across the development portfolio (including new study starts) in late-april 2020.
•our portfolio of products experienced varying impacts from the pandemic. some of our products are medically necessary but also more reliant on maintenance therapy with continuing patients in addition to new patients, some of our products are more reliant on new patient starts and typically require doctor visits, including wellness visits, and some of our products are identified as medically necessary for treatment in the pandemic. a large proportion of our portfolio comprises oral or self-injected medicines that do not require a visit to an infusion center or a physician's office for administration, but vaccines and physician-administered medicines, which do require office visits, were impacted in 2020 by covid-19-related mobility restrictions or limitations and decline in patient visits to doctors. in addition, certain of our vaccines such as prevnar 13/prevenar 13 may be impacted by recommendations by certain health officials to not co-administer such vaccines alongside the covid-19 vaccines. for additional detail on the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our products, see the analysis of the consolidated statements of income-revenues-selected product discussion section within md&a.
pfizer inc.       2020 form 10-k notwithstanding the foregoing impact of the pandemic, given our significant operating cash flows, as well as our financial assets, access to capital markets and revolving credit agreements, we believe we have, and expect to maintain, the ability to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. we will continue to pursue efforts to maintain the continuity of our operations while monitoring for new developments related to the pandemic. future developments could result in additional favorable or unfavorable impacts on our business, operations or financial condition and results. if we experience significant disruption in our manufacturing or supply chains or significant disruptions in clinical trials or other operations, or if demand for our products is significantly reduced as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, we could experience a material adverse impact on our business, operations and financial condition and results. see the item 1a. risk factors-covid-19 pandemic section of this form 10-k.
significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions following is a discussion about the critical accounting estimates and assumptions impacting our consolidated financial statements. also, see note 1c.
for a description of our significant accounting policies, see note 1. of these policies, the following are considered critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most subjective and the most complex judgments: acquisitions (note 1d); fair value (note 1e); revenues (note 1g); asset impairments (note 1l); tax assets and liabilities and income tax contingencies (note 1p); pension and postretirement benefit plans (note 1q); and legal and environmental contingencies (note 1r).
acquisitions and fair value for discussions about the application of fair value, see the following: recent acquisitions (note 2a); investments (note 7a); benefit plan assets (note 11d); and asset impairments below.
revenues our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. such variable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. these deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.
historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1% of revenues. product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product revenue growth trends. if any of our ratios, factors, assessments, experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate estimates of our future experience, our results could be materially affected. the potential of our estimates to vary (sensitivity) differs by program, product, type of customer and geographic location. however, estimates associated with u.s. medicare, medicaid and performance-based contract rebates are most at risk for material adjustment because of the extensive time delay between the recording of the accrual and its ultimate settlement, an interval that can generally range up to one year. because of this lag, our recording of adjustments to reflect actual amounts can incorporate revisions of several prior quarters.
asset impairments we review all of our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. we perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and for all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. when necessary, we record charges for impairments of long-lived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets. our impairment review processes are described in note 1l.
•a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset. for example, a successful challenge of our patent rights would likely result in generic competition earlier than expected.
•a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used such as a restriction imposed by the fda or other regulatory authorities that could affect our ability to manufacture or sell a product.
•an expectation of losses or reduced profits associated with an asset. this could result, for example, from a change in a government reimbursement program that results in an inability to sustain projected product revenues and profitability. this also could result from the introduction of a competitor's product that impacts projected revenue growth, as well as the lack of acceptance of a product by patients, physicians and payers. for ipr&d projects, this could result from, among other things, a change in outlook based on clinical trial data, a delay in the projected launch date or additional expenditures to commercialize the product.
identifiable intangible assets we use an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of intangible assets, other than goodwill. we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset, which incorporates the consideration of a terminal value for indefinite-lived assets, and then we apply an asset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. some of the more significant estimates and assumptions that impact our fair value estimates include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the projections and the impact of technological advancements and risk associated with ipr&d assets, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic origin of the projected cash flows.
while all intangible assets other than goodwill can face events and circumstances that can lead to impairment, those that are most at risk of impairment include ipr&d assets (approximately $3.2 billion as of december 31, 2020) and newly acquired or recently impaired indefinite-lived brand assets. ipr&d assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain nature of r&d. newly acquired and recently impaired indefinite-lived assets are more vulnerable to impairment as the assets are recorded at fair value and are then subsequently measured at the lower of fair value or pfizer inc.       2020 form 10-k carrying value at the end of each reporting period. as such, immediately after acquisition or impairment, even small declines in the outlook for these assets can negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying value and can result in an impairment charge.
goodwill our goodwill impairment review work as of december 31, 2020 concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired and we do not believe the risk of impairment is significant at this time.
in our review, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. qualitative factors that we consider include, for example, macroeconomic and industry conditions, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific events. if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we then perform a quantitative fair value test.
when we are required to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we mainly use the income approach but may also use the market approach, or a weighted-average combination of both approaches.
•the income approach is a forward-looking approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on internal forecasts. within the income approach, we use the discounted cash flow method. we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows for the reporting unit, which includes the application of a terminal value, and then we apply a reporting unit-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the projections, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.
•the market approach is a historical approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on external information. we may use two alternative methods within the market approach:
◦guideline public company method-this method employs market multiples derived from market prices of stocks of companies that are engaged in the same or similar lines of business and that are actively traded on a free and open market and the application of the identified multiples to the corresponding measure of our reporting unit's financial performance.
◦guideline transaction method-this method relies on pricing multiples derived from transactions of significant interests in companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business and the application of the identified multiples to the corresponding measure of our reporting unit's financial performance.
the market approach is only appropriate when the available external information is robust and deemed to be a reliable proxy for the specific reporting unit being valued; however, these assessments may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate. some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the selection of appropriate guideline companies and transactions and the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in ownership percentages, ownership rights, business ownership forms or marketability between the reporting unit and the guideline companies and transactions.
for all of our reporting units, there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing. for a list of these factors, see the forward-looking information and factors that may affect future results and the item 1a. risk factors sections in this form 10-k.
benefit plans for a description of our different benefit plans, see note 11.
effective january 1, 2018, accruals for future benefits under the pcpp (our largest u.s. defined benefit plan) and the defined benefit section of the pfizer group pension scheme (our largest pension plan in the u.k.) were frozen and resulted in elimination of future service costs for the plans. the pfizer defined contribution savings plan provides additional annual contributions to those previously accruing benefits under the pcpp and active members of the pfizer group pension scheme started accruing benefits under the defined contribution section of that plan.
our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and our judgment regarding future expectations that have been deemed reasonable by management. the judgments made in determining the costs of our benefit plans can materially impact our results of operations.

(a)for detailed assumptions associated with our benefit plans, see note 11b.
pfizer inc.       2020 form 10-k expected annual rate of return on plan assets the assumptions for the expected annual rate of return on all of our plan assets reflect our actual historical return experience and our long-term assessment of forward-looking return expectations by asset classes, which is used to develop a weighted-average expected return based on the implementation of our targeted asset allocation in our respective plans.
the expected annual rate of return on plan assets for our u.s. plans and the majority of our international plans is applied to the fair value of plan assets at each year-end and the resulting amount is reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year.
the following illustrates the sensitivity of net periodic benefit costs to a 50 basis point decline in our assumption for the expected annual rate of return on plan assets, holding all other assumptions constant (in millions, pre-tax):

the actual return on plan assets was approximately $2.9 billion during 2020.
discount rate used to measure plan obligations the weighted-average discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our u.s. defined benefit plans is determined at least annually and evaluated and modified, as required, to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated aa/aa or better, that reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. the discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our international plans is determined at least annually by reference to investment grade corporate bonds, rated aa/aa or better, including, when there is sufficient data, a yield-curve approach. these discount rate determinations are made in consideration of local requirements.
the measurement of the plan obligations at the end of the year will affect the amount of service cost, interest cost and amortization expense reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year.
the following illustrates the sensitivity of net periodic benefit costs and benefit obligations to a 10 basis point decline in our assumption for the discount rate, holding all other assumptions constant (in millions, pre-tax):

the change in the discount rates used in measuring our plan obligations as of december 31, 2020 resulted in an increase in the measurement of our aggregate plan obligations by approximately $1.9 billion.
anticipated change in accounting policy we anticipate making a change in our pension accounting policy under which we would begin recognizing actuarial gains and losses immediately in the income statement compared to our current accounting policy that recognizes such gains and losses in stockholders' equity and amortizes them as a component of net periodic benefit cost/(credit) over future periods. this anticipated change is expected to go into effect in the first quarter of 2021 and if adopted, will require recasting prior period amounts to conform to the new accounting policy.

revenues for 2020 included an estimated unfavorable impact of approximately $700 million, or 2%, due to covid-19, primarily reflecting lower demand for certain products in china and unfavorable disruptions to wellness visits for patients in the u.s., which negatively impacted prescribing patterns for certain products, partially offset by increased u.s. demand for certain sterile injectable products and increased adult uptake for prevenar 13 in certain international markets, resulting from greater vaccine awareness for respiratory illnesses, and u.s. revenues for bnt162b2.
emerging markets revenues decreased $456 million, or 5%, in 2020 to $8.4 billion from $8.8 billion in 2019, and were relatively flat operationally, reflecting an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 5% on emerging markets revenues. the relatively flat operational performance was primarily driven by growth from eliquis, prevenar 13, ibrance and zavicefta, offset by lower revenues for consumer healthcare, reflecting the july 31, 2019 completion of the consumer healthcare jv transaction.

revenue deductions our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. these deductions represent estimates of related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.
historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1% of revenues. product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product revenue growth trends.

restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives transforming to a more focused company program for a description of our program, as well as the anticipated and actual costs, see note 3. the program savings discussed below may be rounded and represent approximations. in connection with the costs primarily related to the corporate enabling functions initiatives, we expect gross cost savings of $1.0 billion, or net cost savings, excluding merit and inflation growth and certain real estate cost increases, of $700 million, to be achieved primarily over the two-year period 2021-2022. in connection with manufacturing network optimization, including legacy cost reduction initiatives, we expect targeted net cost savings of $300 million to be achieved primarily from 2020 through 2022.
pfizer inc.       2020 form 10-k certain qualifying costs for this program were recorded in 2020, and in the fourth quarter of 2019, and are reflected as certain significant items and excluded from our non-gaap measure of adjusted income. see the non-gaap financial measure: adjusted income section of this md&a.
in addition to this program, we continuously monitor our operations for cost reduction and/or productivity opportunities, especially in light of the losses of exclusivity and the expiration of collaborative arrangements for various products.

non-gaap financial measure: adjusted income adjusted income is an alternative measure of performance used by management to evaluate our overall performance in conjunction with other performance measures. as such, we believe that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. we use adjusted income, certain components of adjusted income and adjusted diluted eps to present the results of our major operations--the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing, sales and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide--prior to considering certain income statement elements as follows:
measure                                                                                                                                                                          definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   illustrative use adjusted income                                                                                                                                                                  net income attributable to pfizer inc. common shareholders(a)before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items                                                                                                                                                                                     •monthly managerial analysis of our operating results and our annual budgets are prepared using these non-gaap measures•senior management's compensation is determined, in part, using these non-gaap measures(b)
(b)the short-term incentive plans for substantially all non-sales-force employees worldwide are funded from a pool based on our performance, measured in significant part by three metrics, one of which is adjusted diluted eps, which is derived from adjusted income and accounts for 40% of the bonus pool funding. additionally, the payout for performance share awards is determined in part by adjusted net income, which is derived from adjusted income. effective for the 2020 performance year and consistent with shareholder feedback received in 2019, the compensation committee of the bod approved adding an r&d pipeline achievement factor to the existing short-term incentive financial metrics.
adjusted income, and its components and adjusted diluted eps, are non-gaap financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and, therefore, are limited in their usefulness to investors. because of their non-standardized definitions, they may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies and are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. a limitation of these measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to peers. these measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for their directly comparable gaap measures of net income attributable to pfizer inc. common shareholders, components of net income attributable to pfizer inc. common shareholders and eps attributable to pfizer inc. common shareholders-diluted, respectively. see the accompanying reconciliations of certain gaap reported to non-gaap adjusted information for 2020, 2019 and 2018 below.
we also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, these measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to these measures. we also use other tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. for example, our r&d organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. in addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly traded pharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of our incentive compensation plans.
purchase accounting adjustments adjusted income excludes certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. these impacts can include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets, and to a much lesser extent, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes for contingent consideration. therefore, the adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those products.
the exclusion of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which r&d costs have been expensed. however, we have not factored in the impacts of any other differences that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, such as different r&d costs, timelines or resulting sales; accordingly, this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred if we had discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets internally.
acquisition-related costs adjusted income excludes acquisition-related costs, which are comprised of transaction, integration, restructuring charges and additional depreciation costs for business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition. we have made no adjustments for resulting synergies.
the significant costs incurred in connection with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees--a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. for this reason, we believe that such costs incurred can be viewed differently in the context of an acquisition from those costs incurred in other, more normal, business contexts. the integration and restructuring costs for a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts typically ending within three years of the relevant transaction. because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy.
discontinued operations adjusted income excludes the results of discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. we believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our therapeutic areas and product lines for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our business with the intent to discontinue parts of our business. restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.
certain significant items adjusted income excludes certain significant items representing substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated individually on a quantitative and qualitative basis. certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. for example, although major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs are specific to an event or goal with a defined term, we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business, cost productivity or in response to loe or economic conditions. legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances specific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition. unusual items represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. for a non-inclusive list of certain significant items see details of income statement items included in gaap reported but excluded from non-gaap adjusted income below.

pfizer inc.       2020 form 10-k analysis of financial condition, liquidity, capital resources and market risk we rely largely on operating cash flows, short-term investments or commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt to provide for our liquidity requirements. we continue our efforts to improve cash inflows through working capital efficiencies. we target specific areas of focus including accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, and other working capital, which allows us to optimize our operating cash flows.
due to our significant operating cash flows as well as our financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, which can include, among others:
•the working capital requirements of our operations, including our r&d activities;
•investments in our business;
•the cash requirements for our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives;
•contributions to our pension and postretirement plans; and
•business development activities.
our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both s&p and moody's. see the credit ratings section below. we have taken, and will continue to take, a conservative approach to our financial investments and monitoring of our liquidity position in response to market changes. our debt investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified available-for-sale debt securities.
debt capacity-lines of credit we have available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries. we typically maintain cash and cash equivalent balances and short-term investments which, together with our available revolving credit facilities, are in excess of our commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. see note 7c.

(a)see note 7 for a description of certain assets held and for a description of credit risk related to our financial instruments held.
(b)the increase in working capital was primarily driven by the use of upjohn cash distribution proceeds to pay down short-term commercial paper borrowings. see note 2b.
on november 16, 2020, we received $12.0 billion as partial consideration for the contribution of the upjohn business to viatris (see note 2b). in november 2020, we used the cash proceeds to pay down commercial paper and redeem, before the maturity date, the $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of 1.95% senior unsecured notes that were due in june 2021 and $342 million aggregate principal amount of 5.80% senior unsecured notes that were due in august 2023.
•completed a public offering of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured sustainability notes. the proceeds were initially used to repay outstanding commercial paper and subsequently will be used to help manage our environmental impact and support increased patient access to our medicines and vaccines, especially among underserved populations, and strengthen healthcare systems; and
•repurchased at par all $1.065 billion principal amount outstanding of senior unsecured notes that were due in 2047 before the maturity date.

both moody's and s&p lowered pfizer's long-term debt rating one notch to 'a2' and 'a+', respectively, upon completion of the upjohn separation in november 2020. pfizer's short-term rating remained unchanged. additionally, both rating agencies removed pfizer's long-term debt rating from "under review" and assigned a stable outlook.
libor for information on interest rate risk and libor, see the item 1a. risk factors--global operations section in this form 10-k. we do not expect the transition to an alternative rate to have a material impact on our liquidity or financial resources.
global economic conditions our venezuela and argentina operations function in hyperinflationary economies. the impact to pfizer is not considered material. for additional information on the global economic environment, see the item 1a. risk factors--global operations section in this form 10-k.
market risk the objective of our financial risk management program is to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate movements on our earnings. we address these exposures through a combination of operational means and financial instruments. we adapt our practices periodically as economic conditions change. for more information, see notes 1f and 7e, as well as the item 1a. risk factors-global operations section in this form 10-k for key currencies in which we operate.
foreign exchange risk-we are subject to foreign exchange risk in our commercial operations, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and our net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
on the commercial side, a significant portion of our revenues and earnings is exposed to changes in exchange rates. where foreign exchange risk is not offset by other exposures, we may use foreign currency forward-exchange contracts and/or foreign currency swaps to manage that risk.
with respect to our financial assets and liabilities, our primary foreign exchange exposure arises from intercompany receivables and payables, and, to a lesser extent, from investments and debt denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the business entity.
in addition, under certain market conditions, we may seek to protect against possible declines in the reported net investments of our foreign business entities. in these cases, we may use foreign exchange contracts and/or foreign currency debt.
the fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. in this analysis, holding all other assumptions constant and assuming that a change in one currency's rate relative to the u.s. dollar would not have any effect on another currency's rates relative to the u.s. dollar, if the dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10%, as of december 31, 2020, the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant.
interest rate risk-our interest-bearing investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk which may have an impact on net income. depending on market conditions, we may change the profile of our outstanding debt or investments by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps, either to hedge or offset the exposure to changes in the fair value of hedged items with fixed interest rates, or to convert variable rate debt (or investments) to fixed rates.
the fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes. in this analysis, holding all other assumptions constant and assuming a parallel shift in the interest rate curve for all maturities and for all instruments, if there were a one hundred basis point decrease in interest rates as of december 31, 2020, the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant.
equity price risk--we hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values in life science companies as a result of certain business development transactions. while we are holding such securities, we are subject to equity price risk, and this may increase the volatility of our income in future periods due to changes in the fair value of equity investments. from time to time, we will sell such equity securities based on our business considerations, which may include limiting our price risk.
our equity securities with readily determinable fair values are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to equity price rate changes. in this sensitivity analysis, the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant.

operating leases(c)                                                                                                   3,312                      357                     638                        460                      1,856         includes future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases, including an agreement to lease space in an office building in new york city.

(d)also includes obligations to make guaranteed fixed annual payments over the next six years in connection with the u.s. and eu approvals for besponsa ($401 million) and an obligation to make guaranteed fixed annual payments over the next seven years for bosulif ($195 million), both associated with r&d arrangements.
the above table includes amounts for potential milestone payments under collaboration, licensing or other arrangements, if the payments are deemed reasonably likely to occur. payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and/or commercialization milestones, which may span several years and which may never occur.

pfizer inc.       2020 form 10-k dividends on common stock in december 2020, our bod declared a first-quarter dividend of $0.39 per share, payable on march 5, 2021, to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 29, 2021. the first-quarter 2021 cash dividend will be our 329th consecutive quarterly dividend.
our current and projected dividends provide a return to shareholders while maintaining sufficient capital to invest in growing our business. our dividends are not restricted by debt covenants. while the dividend level remains a decision of pfizer's bod and will continue to be evaluated in the context of future business performance, we currently believe that we can support future annual dividend increases, barring significant unforeseen events. viatris is expected to begin paying a quarterly dividend in the second quarter of 2021, at which time pfizer's quarterly dividend is expected to be reduced such that the combined dividend dollar amount received by pfizer shareholders, based upon the combination of continued pfizer ownership and approximately 0.124079 shares of viatris common stock which were granted for each pfizer share in the spin-off, will equate to pfizer's dividend amount in effect immediately prior to the initiation of the viatris dividend.

reference rate reform provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the guidance for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference libor or another reference rate expected to be discontinued after 2021 because of reference rate reform.the new guidance provides the following optional expedients: 1.simplify accounting analyses under current u.s. gaap for contract modifications.2.simplify the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allow hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue.3.allow a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform.                              elections can be adopted prospectively at any time in the first quarter of 2020 through december 31, 2022.                             we are assessing the impact of the provisions of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

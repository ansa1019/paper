item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction illinois tool works inc. (the "company" or "itw") is a global manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with 83 divisions in 52 countries. as of december 31, 2020, the company employed approximately 43,000 people.
due to the large number of diverse businesses and the company's decentralized operating structure, the company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. instead, the company's corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenue, operating income, operating margin, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. these key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management.
the itw business model the powerful and highly differentiated itw business model is the company's core source of value creation. the itw business model is the company's competitive advantage and defines how itw creates value for its shareholders. it is comprised of three unique elements:
•itw's 80/20 front-to-back process is the operating system that is applied in every itw business. initially introduced as a manufacturing efficiency tool in the 1980s, itw has continually refined, improved and expanded 80/20 into a proprietary, holistic business management process that generates significant value for the company and its customers. through the application of data driven insights generated by 80/20 practice, itw focuses on its largest and best opportunities (the "80") and eliminates cost, complexity and distractions associated with the less profitable opportunities (the "20"). 80/20 enables itw businesses to consistently achieve world-class operational excellence in product availability, quality, and innovation, while generating superior financial performance;
•customer-back innovation has fueled decades of profitable growth at itw. the company's unique innovation approach is built on insight gathered from the 80/20 front-to-back process. working from the customer back, itw businesses position themselves as the go-to problem solver for their "80" customers. itw's innovation efforts are focused on understanding customer needs, particularly those in "80" markets with solid long-term growth fundamentals, and creating unique solutions to address those needs. these customer insights and learnings drive innovation at itw and have contributed to a portfolio of approximately 18,500 granted and pending patents;
•itw's decentralized, entrepreneurial culture enables itw businesses to be fast, focused, and responsive. itw businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the itw business model to customize their approach in order to best serve their specific customers' needs. itw colleagues recognize their unique responsibilities to execute the company's strategy and values. as a result, the company maintains a focused and simple organizational structure that, combined with outstanding execution, delivers best-in-class services and solutions adapted to each business' customers and end markets.
enterprise strategy in late 2012, itw began its strategic framework transitioning the company on its current path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the itw business model. the company undertook a complete review of its performance, focusing on its businesses delivering consistent above-market growth with best-in-class margins and returns, and developing a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations.
itw determined that solid and consistent above-market organic growth is the core growth engine to deliver world-class financial performance and compelling long-term returns for its shareholders. to shift its primary growth engine to organic, the company began executing a multi-step approach.
•the first step was to narrow the focus and improve the quality of itw's business portfolio. as part of the portfolio management initiative, itw exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a must-have requirement for all itw businesses. this process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated itw divisions.
as a result of this work, itw's business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential. itw segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve operating margins and generate price/cost increases. the company achieved this through product line simplification, or eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, while supporting and growing the businesses' largest / most profitable customers and product lines.
•step two, business structure simplification, was implemented to simplify and scale up itw's operating structure to support increased engineering, marketing, and sales resources, and improve global reach and competitiveness, all of which were critical to driving accelerated organic growth. itw now has 83 scaled-up divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments, core customers and products, and customer-back innovation.
•the strategic sourcing initiative established sourcing as a core strategic and operational capability at itw, delivering an average of one percent reduction in spend each year from 2013 through 2020 and continues to be a key contributor to the company's ongoing enterprise strategy.
•with the initial portfolio realignment and scale-up work largely complete, the company shifted its focus to preparing for and accelerating organic growth, reapplying the 80/20 front-to-back process to optimize its newly scaled-up divisions for growth, first, to build a foundation of operational excellence, and second, to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth.
itw has clearly demonstrated superior 80/20 management, resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the company's operating margin and after-tax return on invested capital. at the same time, these 80/20 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns.
path to full potential since the launch of the enterprise strategy, the company has made considerable progress to position itself to reach full potential. the itw business model and unique set of capabilities are a source of strong and enduring competitive advantage, but for the company to truly finish the job and reach its full potential, every one of its divisions must also be operating at its full potential. to do so, the company remains focused on its core principles to position itw to perform to its full potential:
•full-potential organic growth portfolio discipline the company only operates in industries where it can generate significant, long-term competitive advantage from the itw business model. itw businesses have the right "raw material" in terms of market and business attributes that best fit the itw business model and have significant potential to drive above-market organic growth over the long-term.
the company focuses on high-quality businesses, ensuring it operates in markets with positive long-term macro fundamentals and with customers that have critical needs and value itw's differentiated products, services and solutions. itw's portfolio operates in highly diverse end markets and geographies which makes the company more resilient in the face of uncertain or volatile market environments.
the company routinely evaluates its portfolio to ensure it delivers sustainable differentiation and drives consistent long-term performance. this includes both implementing portfolio refinements and assessing selective high-quality acquisitions to supplement itw's long-term growth potential.
the company previously communicated its intent to explore options, including potential divestitures, for certain businesses with revenues totaling up to $1 billion. the company expects any earnings per share dilution from divestitures would be offset by incremental share repurchases. in the fourth quarter of 2019, the company completed the divestitures of three businesses and continues to evaluate options for certain other businesses. however, due to the covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the company has deferred any further significant divestiture activity until market conditions normalize. refer to note 3. divestitures in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for more information regarding the company's divestitures.
80/20 front-to-back practice excellence the 80/20 front-to-back process is a rigorous, iterative and highly data-driven approach to identify where the company has true differentiation and the ability to drive sustainable, high-quality organic growth. the company simplifies and eliminates complexity and redesigns every aspect of its business to ensure focused execution on key opportunities, markets, customers, and products.
itw will continue to drive 80/20 front-to-back practice excellence in every division in the company, every day. driving strong operational excellence in the quality of 80/20 front-to-back practice across the company, division by division, will produce further customer-facing performance improvement in a number of the company's divisions and additional structural margin expansion at the enterprise level.
near-term priorities while it was the challenges brought about by the covid-19 pandemic that dominated the company's attention in 2020, it was the collection of capabilities and competitive advantages that have been built and honed over the past eight years through the execution of itw's enterprise strategy that provided the company with the options to respond. this, coupled with the proprietary and powerful itw business model, diversified high-quality business portfolio and diligent execution put the company in a position of strength in dealing with the global pandemic.
from the early days of the pandemic, the company focused its efforts on the following priorities: (1) protect the health and support the well-being of itw's colleagues; (2) continue to serve the company's customers with excellence to the best of its ability; (3) maintain financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality; and (4) leverage the company's strengths to position it to fully participate in the recovery.
"win the recovery" is an execution component of the company's enterprise strategy, not a separate initiative, with every one of the company's divisions identifying specific opportunities presented by the pandemic to capture sustainable share gains that are aligned with the itw long-term enterprise strategy. these efforts are just beginning to take hold and the company expects them to contribute meaningfully to accelerate its progress toward full-potential organic growth. the company continues to focus on delivering strong results in any environment while executing its long-term strategy to achieve and sustain itw's full potential performance.
full-potential organic growth reaching full potential means that every division is positioned for sustainable, high-quality organic growth. the company has clearly defined action plans aimed at leveraging the performance power of the itw business model to achieve full-potential organic growth in every division, with specific focus on:
•customer-back innovation - strengthening the company's commitment to serial innovation and delivering a continuous flow of differentiated new products to its key customers
•strategic sales excellence - deploying a high-performance sales function in every division as the company continues to make progress toward its full potential, the company will explore opportunities to reinforce or further expand the long-term organic growth potential of itw through the addition of selective high-quality acquisitions, such as the recently announced agreement with amphenol corporation ("amphenol"), whereby the company will acquire the test & simulation business of mts systems corporation ("mts") following the closing of amphenol's acquisition of mts. upon completion of this acquisition, this business will be reported within the company's test & measurement and electronics segment.
terms used by itw management uses the following terms to describe the financial results of operations of the company:
•product line simplification (pls) - focuses businesses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines; in the short-term, pls may result in a decrease in revenue and overhead costs while improving operating margin. in the long-term, pls is expected to result in growth in revenue, profitability, and returns.
consolidated results of operations in early 2020, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (covid-19) occurred in china and other jurisdictions. the covid-19 outbreak was subsequently declared a global pandemic by the world health organization on march 11, 2020. in response to the outbreak, governments around the globe have taken various actions to reduce its spread, including travel restrictions, shutdowns of businesses deemed nonessential, and stay-at-home or similar orders. the covid-19 pandemic and the measures taken globally to reduce its spread have negatively impacted the global economy, causing significant disruptions in the company's global operations starting primarily in the latter part of the first quarter of 2020 as covid-19 continued to spread and impact the countries in which the company operates and the markets the company serves.
the company delivered solid financial results in 2020 despite the extraordinary challenges posed by the covid-19 pandemic, as the company experienced solid recovery progress in many of its end markets in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 versus the second quarter. the primary driver of the company's financial performance is the continued successful execution of enterprise initiatives and continued focus on the highly differentiated itw business model. in 2020, despite the decline in operating revenue of 10.9 percent, the company generated operating income of $2.9 billion, operating margin was 22.9 percent, free cash flow was $2.6 billion and after-tax return on average invested capital was 26.2 percent. additionally, all segments, other than the food equipment, automotive oem and welding segments, which had more pronounced impacts from the covid-19 pandemic, had operating margins that improved compared to the prior year. refer to the cash flow and after-tax return on average invested capital sections of liquidity and capital resources for a reconciliation of these non-gaap measures.
for the duration of the covid-19 pandemic, the company is focusing on the following priorities: (1) protect the health and support the well-being of itw's colleagues; (2) continue to serve the company's customers with excellence to the best of its ability; (3) maintain financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality; and (4) leverage the company's strengths to position it to fully participate in the recovery phase. to support itw's colleagues, among its many actions and initiatives, the company redesigned production processes to ensure proper social distancing practices, adjusted shift schedules and assignments to help colleagues who have child and elder care needs, and implemented aggressive new workplace sanitation practices and a coordinated response to ensure access to personal protective equipment to minimize infection risk. to support its customers, the company has worked diligently to keep its facilities open and operating safely. the company has adapted customer service systems and practices to seamlessly serve its customers under "work from home" requirements in many parts of the world.
in areas around the world where governments issued stay-at-home or similar orders, the vast majority of itw's businesses were designated as critical or essential businesses and, as such, they remained open and operational. in some cases, this is because the company's products directly impact the covid-19 response effort. in other cases, the company's businesses are designated as critical because they play a vital role in serving and supporting industries that are deemed essential to the physical and economic health of our communities.
while the vast majority of the company's facilities remained open and operational during the pandemic in 2020, many of these facilities were operating at a reduced capacity. the full extent of the covid-19 outbreak and its impact on the markets served by the company and on the company's operations and financial position continues to be highly uncertain. a prolonged outbreak will continue to interrupt the operations of the company and its customers and suppliers. a description of the risks relating to the impact of the covid-19 outbreak on the company's business, operations and financial condition is contained in part i, item 1a. risk factors.
separately, the company does not believe that tariffs imposed in recent years have had a material impact on its operating results. the company will continue to evaluate the impact of enacted and proposed tariffs on its businesses, as well as pricing actions to mitigate the impact of any raw material cost increases resulting from these tariffs.

liquidity and capital resources the company's primary sources of liquidity are free cash flow and short-term credit facilities. as of december 31, 2020, the company had $2.6 billion of cash and equivalents on hand, no outstanding borrowings under its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, and no commercial paper outstanding. the company also has maintained strong access to public debt markets. management believes that these sources are sufficient to service debt and to finance the company's capital allocation priorities, which include:
•external investments in selective strategic acquisitions that support the company's organic growth focus and an active share repurchase program that the company temporarily suspended starting in march 2020 due to the covid-19 pandemic.
also, for the duration of the covid-19 pandemic, the company has made the strategic decision to aggressively manage its discretionary costs and working capital, while staying invested in its businesses, people and strategies, so that the company is positioned to fully support its customers in the recovery phase and can continue executing its long-term strategy to deliver differentiated long-term performance and returns.
the company believes that, based on its operating revenue, operating margin, free cash flow, and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing, if necessary. a description of the risks related to the impact of the covid-19 outbreak on the financial and capital markets and the related potential risks to the company is contained in part i, item 1a. risk factors.
cash flow the company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. the company believes this non-gaap financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the company's financial performance and measures the company's ability to generate cash internally to fund company initiatives. free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. summarized cash flow information for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows:
net cash provided by operating activities                              $2,807                     $2,995                    $2,811

on august 3, 2018, the company's board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program which provides for the repurchase of up to an additional $3.0 billion of the company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the "2018 program"). under the 2018 program, the company repurchased approximately 6.7 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $158.11 per share during 2019 and approximately 4.2 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $167.69 per share in the first quarter of 2020. as of december 31, 2020, there were approximately $1.2 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2018 program. in 2020, due to the covid-19 pandemic, the company temporarily suspended its share repurchase program starting in march and intends to resume purchases in 2021.
after-tax return on average invested capital the company uses after-tax return on average invested capital ("after-tax roic") to measure the effectiveness of its operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. after-tax roic is a non-gaap financial measure that the company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the company's financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate after-tax roic. for comparability, the company excluded the third quarter 2019 discrete tax benefit of $21 million from the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2019. additionally, the company excluded the third quarter 2018 net discrete tax benefit of $15 million from the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2018. average invested capital represents the net assets of the company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the company's operations. average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. after-tax roic for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was as follows:
invested capital:
total invested capital                                $8,740                   $8,807                   $9,134

after-tax roic decreased 250 basis points for the twelve month period ended december 31, 2020 compared to the prior year period as a result of a 13.1% decrease in after-tax operating income versus a 5.0% decrease in average invested capital. after-tax roic increased 50 basis points for the twelve month period ended december 31, 2019 compared to the prior year period as a result of a 5.3% decrease in average invested capital versus a 3.9% decrease in after-tax operating income.

liabilities held for sale                               -                       71                    (71)
net working capital                                $3,934                   $4,099                  $(165)
as of december 31, 2020, a significant portion of the company's cash and equivalents was held by international subsidiaries. cash and equivalents held internationally may be subject to foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the u.s. cash and equivalents held internationally are typically used for international operating needs or reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses. international funds may also be used to fund international acquisitions or, if not considered permanently invested, may be repatriated to the u.s. the company has accrued for foreign withholding taxes related to foreign held cash and equivalents that are not permanently invested.
in the u.s., the company utilizes cash flows from operations to fund domestic cash needs and the company's capital allocation priorities. this includes operating needs of the u.s. businesses, dividend payments, share repurchases, acquisitions, servicing of domestic debt obligations, reinvesting to fund expansion of existing u.s. businesses and general corporate needs. the company may also use its commercial paper program, which is backed by long-term credit facilities, for short-term liquidity needs. the company believes cash generated by operations and liquidity provided by the company's commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the u.s.
as of december 31, 2020, short-term debt included $350 million related to the 3.375% notes due september 15, 2021. as of december 31, 2019, short-term debt included $4 million related to the 4.88% notes due through december 31, 2020, which were repaid by the due date. there was no commercial paper outstanding as of december 31, 2020 and 2019. the increase in total debt as of december 31, 2020 was primarily due to the revaluation of the company's euro-denominated notes. refer to note 10. debt in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for additional details regarding the company's euro notes.
the company may issue commercial paper to fund general corporate needs, share repurchases, and small and medium-sized acquisitions. during the third quarter of 2019, the company entered into a $2.5 billion, five-year revolving credit facility with a termination date of september 27, 2024 to support the potential issuances of commercial paper. no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december 31, 2020. the company did not have any commercial paper outstanding during 2020.
as of december 31, 2020, the company's foreign operations had authorized credit facilities with unused capacity of $195 million.
total debt to ebitda the company uses the ratio of total debt to ebitda as a measure of its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. ebitda and the ratio of total debt to ebitda are non-gaap financial measures. the company believes that total debt to ebitda is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the company's long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to ebitda. the ratio of total debt to ebitda represents total debt divided by net income before interest expense, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis. total debt to ebitda for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows:
ebitda                                                      $3,309                   $3,828                  $4,045
total debt to ebitda ratio                                         2.5                     2.0                     1.8
stockholders' equity the changes to stockholders' equity during 2020 and 2019 were as follows:
operating lease liability                         58                     49                    37                      25                    14      15
as of december 31, 2020, the company had recorded noncurrent liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $216 million. the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments related to the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. the company did not have any significant off-balance sheet commitments at december 31, 2020.
critical accounting estimates the company has three accounting estimates that it believes are most important to the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. management bases its estimates on historical experience, and in some cases on observable market information. various assumptions are also used that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates.
the company's critical accounting estimates are as follows:
income taxes- the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws. the company's deferred and other tax balances are based on management's interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions. income tax expense, assets and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other things, the level of future taxable income, the effect of the company's various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions. future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company.
goodwill and intangible assets- the company's business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which are a significant portion of the company's total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the company could incur in future periods. the company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. on an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists. if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment loss is recorded for the difference. in calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets, management relies on a number of factors, including business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets.
as of december 31, 2020, the company had total goodwill and intangible assets of approximately $5.5 billion allocated to its reporting units. although there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets, the company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets. in addition, the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time, and in many cases have been able to improve their performance, primarily as a result of the application of the company's 80/20 front-to-back process. the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units ranges from approximately $238 million to $1.1 billion, with the average amount equal to $545 million. fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above. due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the company's global end markets, impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods.
pension and other postretirement benefits- the company has various company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a number of u.s. employees and many employees outside the u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations. pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant's years of service, future compensation, and age at retirement or termination. important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets, life expectancy, and health care cost trend rates. future changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the amounts recorded related to the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans. see note 11. pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.
the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the year-end measurement date for the u.s. primary pension plan. the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year. in estimating this rate, the company looks at rates of return on high-quality fixed income investments, with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan. a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the u.s. primary pension plan obligation by approximately $40 million. the company estimates the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash flows rather than a single weighted-average rate. see note 11. pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for information on the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions.

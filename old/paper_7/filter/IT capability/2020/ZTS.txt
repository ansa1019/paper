item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
introduction our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is provided to assist readers in understanding our performance, as reflected in the results of our operations, our financial condition and our cash flows. this md&a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. the discussion in this md&a contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. our future results could differ materially from historical performance and from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors such as those discussed in item 1a. risk factors and forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results sections of this md&a.
a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 is presented below. a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 can be found under item 7 of part ii of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019, filed with the sec on february 13, 2020 (our "2019 annual report"), which is available free of charge on the sec's website at www.sec.gov.
overview of our business we are a global leader in the animal health industry, focused on the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of medicines, vaccines, diagnostic products, biodevices, genetic tests and precision livestock farming technology. for more than 65 years, we have been committed to enhancing the health of animals and bringing solutions to our customers who raise and care for them.
we manage our operations through two geographic operating segments: the united states (u.s.) and international. within each of these operating segments, we offer a diversified product portfolio for both companion animals and livestock customers in order to capitalize on local and regional trends and customer needs. see notes to consolidated financial statements-note 19. segment information.
we directly market our products to veterinarians and livestock producers located in approximately 45 countries across north america, europe, africa, asia, australia and south america, and are a market leader in nearly all of the major regions in which we operate. through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets, such as brazil, chile, china and mexico, we believe we are one of the largest animal health medicines and vaccines businesses as measured by revenue across emerging markets as a whole. in markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence, we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products.
we believe our investments in one of the industry's largest sales organizations, including our extensive network of technical and veterinary operations specialists, our high-quality manufacturing and reliability of supply, and our long track record of developing products that meet customer needs, has led to enduring and valued relationships with our customers. our research and development (r&d) efforts enable us to deliver innovative products to address unmet needs and evolve our product lines so they remain relevant for our customers.
our products include over 300 products and product lines that we sell in over 100 countries for the prediction, prevention, detection and treatment of diseases and conditions that affect various companion animal and livestock species. the diversity of our product portfolio and our global operations provides stability to our overall business. for instance, in livestock, impacts on our revenue that may result from disease outbreaks or weather conditions in a particular market or region are often offset by increased sales in other regions from exports and other species as consumers shift to other proteins.
a summary of our 2020 performance compared with the comparable 2019 and 2018 periods follows:
•increasing demand for improved nutrition, particularly animal protein;
•natural resource constraints, such as scarcity of arable land, fresh water and increased competition for cultivated land, resulting in fewer resources that will be available to meet an increasing demand for animal protein;
•increased focus on food safety and food security.
product development initiatives our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products, including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition. we believe we are an industry leader in animal health r&d, with a track record of generating new products and product lifecycle innovation. the majority of our r&d programs focus on product lifecycle innovation, which is defined as r&d programs that leverage existing animal health products by adding new species or claims, achieving approvals in new markets or creating new combinations and reformulations. in addition to traditional medicines and vaccines, we develop products across additional categories to address the needs of veterinarians and producers to predict, prevent, detect and treat conditions in both companion animals and livestock, including products in diagnostics, genetics, precision livestock farming and digital and data analytics.
perceptions of product quality, safety and reliability we believe that animal health customers value high-quality manufacturing and reliability of supply. the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners, veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty, which often continues after the loss of patent-based and regulatory exclusivity. we depend on positive perceptions of the safety and quality of our products by our customers, veterinarians and end-users.
in addition, negative beliefs about animal health products generally could impact demand for our products. for example, the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from food-producing animals to human pathogens, and the causality of that transfer, continue to be the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion. antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a sub-categorization of the products that make up our anti-infectives and medicated feed additives portfolios. in some countries, this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some food-producing animals, regardless of the route of administration (in feed or injectable). these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty. in addition, consumer preferences in some markets have impacted the use of antibacterials in food producing animals. such restrictions and consumer preferences in some cases may negatively impact sales of our antibacterial products, but in other instances may increase sales of our products that can be used as antibacterial alternatives. our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2020.
similarly, concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and other potential environmental impacts of livestock production have led to some consumers opting to limit or avoid consuming animal products. however, we believe the impact of this trend is limited as the livestock industry is still expected to continue to grow in order to feed a growing global population.
changing distribution channels for companion animal products in most markets, companion animal owners typically purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians. however, in the u.s. and certain other markets, companion animal owners increasingly have the option to purchase animal health products from sources other than veterinarians, such as internet-based retailers, "big-box" retail stores or other over-the-counter distribution channels. this trend has been demonstrated by the shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of flea and tick products in recent years and has been accelerated by the increase in e-commerce during the covid-19 pandemic. we believe the ability of pet owners to purchase our products online and from retail stores may increase pet owner compliance and result in increased sales, particularly in the near term. however, over time, we may be unable to sustain our current margins due to the increased purchasing power of such retailers as compared to traditional veterinary practices.
in addition, this trend could negatively impact the sales of products we primarily sell through the veterinarian distribution channel, as any decrease in visits to veterinarians by companion animal owners could reduce our market share and sales of such products. a reduction in the number of pet owners who purchase our products directly from their veterinarian could also lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our products with other animal health products or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lower-cost alternatives.
the overall economic environment in addition to industry-specific factors, we, like other businesses, face challenges related to global economic conditions. growth in both the livestock and companion animal sectors is driven by overall economic development and related growth, particularly in many emerging markets. in the past, certain of our customers and suppliers have been affected directly by economic downturns, which decreased the demand for our products and, in some cases, hindered our ability to collect amounts due from customers.
the cost of medicines and vaccines to our livestock producer customers is small relative to other production costs, including feed, and the use of these products is intended to improve livestock producers' economic outcomes. as a result, demand for our products has historically been more stable than demand for other production inputs. similarly, industry sources have reported that pet owners indicated a preference for reducing spending on other aspects of their lifestyle, including entertainment, clothing and household goods, before reducing spending on pet care. while these factors have mitigated the impact of prior downturns in the global economy, future economic challenges could increase cost sensitivity among our
customers, which may result in reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
competition the animal health industry is highly competitive. although our business is the largest by revenue in the animal health medicines, vaccines and diagnostics industry, we face competition in the regions in which we operate. principal methods of competition vary depending on the particular region, species, product category or individual product. some of these methods include new product development, quality, price, service and promotion to veterinary professionals, pet owners and livestock producers. our competitors include standalone animal health businesses and the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies. in recent years, there has been an increase in consolidation in the animal health industry. there are also several start-up companies working in the animal health area. in addition to competition from established market participants, there could be new entrants to the animal health medicines, vaccines and diagnostics industry in the future. we also compete with companies that produce generic products, following our products' loss of exclusivity in a given market. for example, draxxin currently competes with generic products in key markets including europe, canada, mexico and australia and we expect generic competition in the u.s. in 2021. for more information regarding the generic competition we currently have and expect to encounter as patents on certain of our key products expire, see item 1. business - intellectual property.
weather conditions, climate change and the availability of natural resources the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by weather conditions, as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weather-related pressures from pests, such as ticks. as a result, we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations.
in addition, veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to the animals under their care. veterinarians' patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience prolonged snow, ice or other severe weather conditions, particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather. furthermore, weather conditions, including excessive cold or heat, natural disasters and other events, could negatively impact our livestock customers by impairing the health or growth of their animals or the production or availability of feed, as well as disrupting their normal operations. for example, livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources, including large supplies of fresh water. their animals' health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth, climate change or floods, droughts or other weather conditions. in the event of adverse weather conditions, climate-change related impacts or a shortage of fresh water, veterinarians and livestock producers may purchase less of our products.
for example, drought conditions could negatively impact, among other things, the supply of corn and the availability of grazing pastures. a decrease in harvested corn results in higher corn prices, which could negatively impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle, pork and poultry. higher corn prices and reduced availability of grazing pastures contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that in turn result in less spending on animal health products. as such, a prolonged drought could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and climate change may also impact the aquaculture business. changes in water temperatures could affect the timing of reproduction and growth of various fish species, as well as trigger the outbreak of certain water borne diseases.
we continue to closely monitor the impact of the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic and the resulting global recession on all aspects of our business across geographies, including how it has and may continue to impact our customers, workforce, suppliers and vendors. we are currently designated an essential business globally and have continued physical operations with respect to research and development, manufacturing and our supply chain. as the pandemic continues to progress, the severity of the impact across markets remains uncertain as the number of cases rises and falls in various jurisdictions leading to changes in the imposition of restrictive measures intended to contain the virus.
due to numerous uncertainties regarding the continuing covid-19 pandemic, we are unable to fully predict the impact that it will ultimately have on our future financial position and operating results. these uncertainties include the severity of the virus, the duration of the outbreak and number of recurrences, the effectiveness of measures to contain and treat the virus, including the timing of widespread vaccinations, governmental, business or other actions in response to the pandemic (which could include actions that result in limitations on, or disruptions to, our manufacturing, transportation and other operations, or mandates to provide products or services), impacts on our supply chain, the effect on customer demand, or changes to our operations. we cannot predict the impact that the covid-19 pandemic will have on our customers, vendors and suppliers; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us. in particular, our livestock customers have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by facility closures, reduced packing plant capacity, quarantines, travel bans and labor shortages, and the shift in protein production from foodservice to grocery, among other impacts. in addition, our companion animal customers have been, and may in the future be, negatively impacted by lack of demand for veterinary services in areas where lockdown and stay-at-home orders are in place. the impact of covid-19 on our customers has reduced and could continue to reduce the demand for our products, which could continue to adversely impact our revenue. the health of our workforce, and our ability to meet staffing needs in our manufacturing operations and other critical functions also cannot be predicted and is vital to our operations. further, the impacts of a prolonged global recession and the continued disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets, as well as other unanticipated consequences, remain unknown. in addition, in order to preserve liquidity, we issued debt securities in may 2020 and we may in the future incur additional indebtedness, whether through the issuance of debt securities, drawdowns under our credit facility or otherwise. an increase in our outstanding indebtedness will result in additional interest expense.
the situation surrounding covid-19 remains fluid, and we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take actions that alter our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our workforce, customers, vendors, suppliers, and other stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. it is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may ultimately have on our business, including the effects on our customers, workforce, and prospects, or on our financial results in fiscal 2021.
disease outbreaks sales of our livestock products could be adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals. outbreaks of disease may reduce regional or global sales of particular animal-derived food products or result in reduced exports of such products, either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions, which may reduce demand for our products. also, the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. alternatively, sales of products that treat specific disease outbreaks may increase.
manufacturing and supply in order to sell our products, we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities. many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are sole-sourced from certain manufacturing sites. minor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes, such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing, could result in delays, inventory shortages, unanticipated costs, product recalls, product liability and/or regulatory action. in addition, a number of factors could cause production interruptions that could result in launch delays, inventory shortages, recalls, unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties.
our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes. the unpredictability of a product's regulatory or commercial success or failure, the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites, and shifting customer demand increase the potential for capacity imbalances.
foreign exchange rates significant portions of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. our products are sold in more than 100 countries and, as a result, our revenue is influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates. for the year ended december 31, 2020, approximately 42% of our revenue was denominated in foreign currencies. we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk, in part, through operational means, including managing same-currency revenue in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. as we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the euro, brazilian real, chinese renminbi, canadian dollar, australian dollar, u.k. pound and other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar will impact our revenue, cost of goods and expenses, and consequently, net income. exchange rate fluctuations may also have an impact beyond our reported financial results and directly impact operations. these fluctuations may affect the ability to buy and sell our goods and services between markets impacted by significant exchange rate variances. for the year ended december 31, 2020, approximately 58% of our total revenue was in u.s. dollars. our year-over-year total revenue growth was unfavorably impacted by 2% from changes in foreign currency values relative to the u.s. dollar.
•drive innovative growth - we seek to deliver new products and solutions as well as lifecycle innovations across the continuum of care that spans from disease prediction and prevention to detection and treatment. we are focused on innovating across vaccines, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, genetics, biodevices, and other product segments, and across all major species. where appropriate, we complement internal r&d programs with external innovations;
•enhance customer experience - we believe that delighting our customers with compelling and personalized experiences that enable them to provide the best care for animals is critical for our success. we are focused on providing greater value to our customers through the integration and connectedness of our portfolio and by reducing frictions in the way they engage with us and our products and solutions;
•lead in digital and data analytics - we believe that healthcare insights enabled by data and digital technology and complemented with our comprehensive portfolio of products and solutions will be critical in enhancing care for animals and improving livestock productivity;
•cultivate a high-performing organization - we view the strength of our team and our talented colleagues around the world as a critical component of our past and future success. we are committed to continuing to be a company our colleagues can be proud of and to attracting, retaining and developing the best, most diverse talent in the industry. we are further committed to sustaining a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment for our colleagues;
•champion a healthier, more sustainable future - as the world's leading animal health company, our business purpose is well aligned with our social purpose. we strive to make a meaningful difference in society through the three pillars of our sustainability approach: (1) by caring and collaborating with our customers, colleagues, and communities, and the animals that depend on them by improving access to care for animals, by creating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive work environment, and by supporting the veterinary profession; (2) by leveraging our innovation capabilities to develop solutions that improve productivity, keep animals healthy, and fight emerging infectious diseases; and (3) by taking actions to protect our planet that reduce our footprint on the environment.
2020, our top two selling products, apoquel and simparica/simparica trio, contributed approximately 10% and 6%, respectively, of our revenue, and combined with our next three top selling products, revolution/revolution plus/stronghold, draxxin and the ceftiofur line, these five contributed approximately 31% of our revenue. our top ten product lines contributed 44% of our revenue. for additional information regarding our products, including descriptions of our product lines that each represented approximately 1% or more of our revenue in 2020, see item 1. business-products.
costs and expenses costs of sales consist primarily of cost of materials, facilities and other infrastructure used to manufacture our medicine and vaccine products and royalty expenses associated with the intellectual property of our products, when relevant.
selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses consist of, among other things, the internal and external costs of marketing, promotion, advertising and shipping and handling as well as certain costs related to business technology, facilities, legal, finance, human resources, business development, public affairs and procurement.
research and development (r&d) expenses consist primarily of project costs specific to new product r&d and product lifecycle innovation, overhead costs associated with r&d operations and investments that support local market clinical trials for approved indications and expenses related to regulatory approvals for our products. we do not disaggregate r&d expenses by research stage or by therapeutic area for purposes of managing our business.
amortization of intangible assets consists primarily of the amortization expense for identifiable finite-lived intangible assets that have been acquired through business combinations. these assets consist of, but are not limited to, developed technology, brands and trademarks.
restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs consist of all restructuring charges (those associated with acquisition activity and those associated with cost reduction/productivity initiatives), as well as costs associated with acquiring and integrating businesses. restructuring charges are associated with employees, assets and activities that will not continue in the company. acquisition-related costs are associated with acquiring and integrating acquired businesses, such as abaxis in 2018, and may include transaction costs and expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes.
other (income)/deductions-net consist primarily of various items including net (gains)/losses on asset disposals, royalty-related income, foreign exchange translation (gains)/losses and certain asset impairment charges.
significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates in presenting our financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. for a description of our significant accounting policies, see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 3. significant accounting policies.
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments and, therefore, could have the greatest impact on our financial statements: (i) fair value; (ii) revenue; (iii) asset impairment reviews; and (iv) contingencies.
below are some of our more critical accounting estimates. see also notes to consolidated financial statements- note 3. significant accounting policies: estimates and assumptions for a discussion about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions.
•for sales returns, we perform calculations in each market that incorporate the following, as appropriate: local returns policies and practices; returns as a percentage of revenue; an understanding of the reasons for past returns; estimated shelf life by product; an estimate of the amount of time between shipment and return or lag time; and any other factors that could impact the estimate of future returns, product recalls, discontinuation of products or a changing competitive environment; and
•for revenue incentives, we use our historical experience with similar incentives programs to estimate the impact of such programs on revenue.
if any of our ratios, factors, assessments, experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate predictors of our future experience, our results could be materially affected. although the amounts recorded for these revenue deductions are dependent on estimates and assumptions, historically our adjustments to actual results have not been material. the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program, type of customer and geographic location.
amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions. for further information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 3. significant accounting policies: estimates and assumptions.
asset impairment reviews we review all of our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year and we perform detailed testing whenever impairment indicators are present. in addition, we perform impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually. when necessary, we record charges for impairments of long-lived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets.
our impairment review processes are described below and in notes to consolidated financial statements- note 3. significant accounting policies: amortization of intangible assets, depreciation and certain long-lived assets and, for deferred tax assets, in note 3. significant accounting policies: deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax contingencies.
•a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used. for example, restrictions imposed by the regulatory authorities could affect our ability to manufacture or sell a product; and
•a projection or forecast that demonstrates losses or reduced profits associated with an asset. this could result, for example, from the introduction of a competitor's product that results in a significant loss of market share or the inability to achieve the previously projected revenue growth, or from the lack of acceptance of a product by customers.
for finite-lived identifiable intangible assets, such as developed technology rights, and for other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, whenever impairment indicators are present, we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset, or asset group, and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount. if the carrying amount is found to be greater, we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value. in addition, in all cases of an impairment review, we re-evaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them, as appropriate.
our impairment reviews of most of our long-lived assets depend on the determination of fair value, as defined by u.s. gaap, and these judgments can materially impact our results of operations. a single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions. for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see notes to consolidated financial statements-note 3. significant accounting policies: estimates and assumptions.
intangible assets other than goodwill we test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying value is performed. if the fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. impairments of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill, are recorded in restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs and other (income)/deductions-net, as applicable. we did not have any significant intangible asset impairment charges for the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
when we are required to determine the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill, we use an income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method, also known as the discounted cash flow method. we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset, which includes the application of a terminal value for indefinite-lived assets, and then we apply an asset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the projections, the impact of technological risk associated with ipr&d assets, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the risks inherent in the projected cash flows; foreign currency fluctuations; and the effective tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.
while all identifiable intangible assets can be impacted by events and thus lead to impairment, in general, identifiable intangible assets that are at the highest risk of impairment include ipr&d assets (approximately $88 million as of december 31, 2020). ipr&d assets are higher-risk assets because r&d is an inherently risky activity.
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses purchased and is assigned to reporting units. we test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, either by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or by performing a periodic quantitative assessment.
factors considered in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, the overall financial performance of the reporting unit and whether there have been sustained declines in our share price. additionally, we evaluate the extent to which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit at the date of the last quantitative assessment performed.
when performing a quantitative assessment to test for goodwill impairment we utilize the income approach, which is forward-looking, and relies primarily on internal forecasts. within the income approach, the method that we use is the discounted cash flow method. we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit, which includes the application of a terminal value, and then apply a reporting unit-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value. some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive, legal and/or regulatory
forces on the projections, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the effective tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.
in 2020, we performed a periodic quantitative impairment assessment as of september 30, 2020, which did not result in the impairment of goodwill associated with any of our reporting units.
in 2019, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment as of september 30, 2019, which did not result in the impairment of goodwill associated with any of our reporting units.
for all of our reporting units, there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing. for a list of these factors, see forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results.
for a discussion about legal contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications, see notes to consolidated financial statement- note 18. commitments and contingencies.
non-gaap financial measures we report information in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). management also measures performance using non-gaap financial measures that may exclude certain amounts from the most directly comparable gaap measure. despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, non-gaap financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by u.s. gaap and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors and may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. we present certain identified non-gaap measures solely to provide investors with useful information to more fully understand how management assesses performance.
operational growth we believe that it is important to not only understand overall revenue and earnings growth, but also "operational growth." operational growth is a non-gaap financial measure defined as revenue or earnings growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. this measure provides information on the change in revenue and earnings as if foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the current and prior periods to facilitate a period-to-period comparison. we believe this non-gaap measure provides a useful comparison to previous periods for the company and investors, but should not be viewed as a substitute for u.s. gaap reported growth.
adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share adjusted net income and the corresponding adjusted earnings per share (eps) are non-gaap financial measures of performance used by management. we believe these financial measures are useful supplemental information to investors when considered together with our u.s. gaap financial measures. we report adjusted net income to portray the results of our major operations, and the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of our products, prior to considering certain income statement elements. we define adjusted net income and adjusted eps as net income attributable to zoetis and eps before the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items.
we recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the adjusted net income and adjusted eps measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to these metrics. a limitation of the adjusted net income and adjusted eps measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies. the adjusted net income and adjusted eps measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for u.s. gaap reported net income attributable to zoetis and reported eps. see the adjusted net income section below for more information.
analysis of the consolidated statements of income the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated statements of income should be read along with our consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto.

(a)    amortization expense related to finite-lived acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute products, compounds and intellectual property is included in amortization of intangible assets as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. amortization expense related to finite-lived acquired intangible assets that are associated with a single function is included in cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses or research and development expenses, as appropriate.
total revenue increased by $415 million, or 7%, in 2020 compared with 2019 reflecting operational revenue growth of $546 million, or 9%. operational revenue growth was primarily due to the following:
•recent acquisitions which contributed approximately 1%.
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased from 32% to 31% in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily as a result of:
•the inclusion of recent acquisitions.
sg&a expenses increased $88 million, or 5%, in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily as a result of:
•expenses related to recent acquisitions;
r&d expenses increased $6 million, or 1%, in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily as a result of:
amortization of intangible assets increased $5 million, or 3%, in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily as a result of certain intangible assets acquired during 2020 and 2019.

our acquisition-related costs primarily relate to restructuring charges for employees, assets and activities that will not continue in the future, as well as integration costs. the majority of net restructuring charges are related to termination costs. our integration costs are generally comprised of consulting costs related to the integration of systems and processes, as well as product transfer costs.
for additional information regarding restructuring charges and acquisition-related costs, see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 6. restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions, cost-reduction and productivity initiatives.
restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs decreased by $26 million in 2020 compared with 2019. restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs in 2020 consisted of integration costs related to recent acquisitions, restructuring charges related to ceo transition-related costs and employee termination costs related to other cost-reduction and productivity initiatives. restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs in 2019 included integration costs and employee termination costs incurred as a result of the acquisition of abaxis in the third quarter of 2018.

interest expense, net of capitalized interest                     $231                      $223                      $206       4                                 8
interest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased by $8 million, or 4%, in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily as a result of the issuance of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes in may 2020, partially offset by the redemption of $500 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes in october 2020 and an increase in capitalized interest in 2020 compared with 2019.
the change in other (income)/deductions-net from net other deductions of $17 million in 2020 compared with net other income of $57 million in 2019, is primarily as a result of:
•an impairment of an equity investment; and
the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income includes tax costs and benefits, such as uncertain tax positions, repatriation decisions and audit settlements, among others.
the higher effective tax rate in 2020 compared with 2019 is primarily due to the following components:
•changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, which includes the impact of the location of earnings from operations and repatriation costs. the jurisdictional mix of earnings can vary as a result of repatriation decisions, operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and the impact of non-deductible and non-taxable items;
•a $5 million discrete tax expense and an $18 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to changes in valuation allowances;
•a $14 million net discrete deferred tax benefit recorded in 2019 due to a change in tax basis related to purchase accounting;
•a $4 million and $10 million net discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to the effective settlement of certain issues with tax authorities; and
•a $4 million and $8 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to a remeasurement of deferred taxes as a result of changes in statutory tax rates, partially offset by:
•a $29 million and $20 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to the excess tax benefits for share-based payments;
•a $19 million and $12 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to changes in various other tax items; and
•a $7 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 related to a remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from the integration of acquired businesses.
operating segment results we believe that it is important to not only understand overall revenue and earnings growth, but also "operational growth." operational growth is defined as revenue or earnings growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
in 2020, the company realigned certain management responsibilities. these changes did not impact the determination of our operating segments, however they resulted in the reallocation of certain costs between segments. these changes primarily include the following: (i) r&d costs related to our aquaculture business, which were previously reported in our international commercial segment, are now reported in other business activities; (ii) certain other miscellaneous costs, which were previously reported in international commercial segment results, are now reported in corporate; and (iii) certain diagnostics and other miscellaneous costs, which were previously reported in our u.s. results, are now reported in corporate.

u.s. operating segment u.s. segment revenue increased by $354 million, or 11%, in 2020 compared with 2019, of which $407 million resulted from growth in companion animal products, offset by a $53 million decline in livestock products.
•companion animal revenue growth was driven primarily by increased sales of parasiticides including simparica trio, our new triple combination parasiticide, the key dermatology portfolio, and recent acquisitions of platinum performance and a number of regional diagnostic reference labs.
•livestock revenue decreased due to disruptions in the food supply chain attributable to the negative impact of covid-19, including reduced producer processing capacity and continued channel migration from dining out to at-home consumption that impacted producer profitability. the negative impact resulted in a decline across each of the cattle, swine and poultry portfolios. the decline in the cattle portfolio was also the result of continued unfavorable market conditions in beef and dairy, while swine was also impacted by export restrictions on the use of certain products in our portfolio that limited our customers' access to global markets.
u.s. segment earnings increased by $234 million, or 12%, in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to revenue and gross margin growth, partially offset by higher operating expenses for investments to support revenue growth.
international operating segment international segment revenue increased by $63 million, or 2%, in 2020 compared with 2019. operational revenue increased $194 million, or 7%, reflecting growth of $134 million in companion animal products and $60 million in livestock products.
•companion animal operational revenue growth resulted primarily from increased sales of our parasiticide products including the simparica franchise with the launch of simparica trio in the eu, canada and australia, as well as the revolution/revolution plus/stronghold franchise. key dermatology products also contributed to growth with increased sales of apoquel and cytopoint.
•livestock operational revenue growth was driven by increased sales in swine and fish while cattle and poultry declined. sales of swine products grew as a result of expanding herd production and increased biosecurity measures in the wake of african swine fever in china. alpha flux, a recently launched parasiticide that controls sea lice in salmon, increased market share and the recent acquisition of fish vet group were the primary drivers of growth in fish. sales of cattle products declined due to decreased demand attributable to the impact of covid-19 in certain markets as well as the discontinuation of non-core products in brazil. poultry declined due to the negative impacts of covid-19 on poultry consumption.
•additionally, international segment revenue was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange which decreased revenue by approximately $130 million, or 5%, primarily driven by the depreciation of the brazilian real, argentine peso, mexican peso and turkish lira.
international segment earnings increased by $60 million, or 4%, in 2020 compared with 2019. operational earnings growth was $136 million, or 9%, primarily due to higher revenue and lower operating expenses, partially offset by higher cost of sales.
other business activities other business activities includes our css contract manufacturing results, our human health business and expenses associated with our dedicated veterinary medicine r&d organization, research alliances, u.s. regulatory affairs and other operations focused on the development of our products. other r&d-related costs associated with non-u.s. market and regulatory activities are generally included in the international segment.
other business activities net loss increased by $24 million, or 7%, in 2020 compared with 2019, reflecting an increase in r&d costs due to an increase in compensation-related costs and in project investments, partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expenses as a result of decreases in travel and events related to the covid-19 pandemic and favorable foreign exchange.
reconciling items reconciling items include certain costs that are not allocated to our operating segments results, such as costs associated with the following:
•corporate, which includes certain costs associated with business technology, facilities, legal, finance, human resources, business development and communications, among others. these costs also include certain compensation costs, certain procurement costs, and other miscellaneous operating expenses that are not charged to our operating segments, as well as interest income and expense;
•certain transactions and events such as (i) purchase accounting adjustments, which includes expenses associated with the amortization of fair value adjustments to inventory, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment; (ii) acquisition-related activities, which includes costs for acquisition and integration; and (iii) certain significant items, which includes non-acquisition-related restructuring charges, certain asset impairment charges, stand-up costs, certain legal and commercial settlements, and costs associated with cost reduction/productivity initiatives; and
•other unallocated, which includes (i) certain overhead expenses associated with our global manufacturing operations not charged to our operating segments; (ii) certain costs associated with business technology and finance that specifically support our global manufacturing operations; (iii) certain supply chain and global logistics costs; and (iv) certain procurement costs.
corporate expenses increased by $113 million, or 16%, in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to an increase in expenses related to depreciation and recent acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in certain compensation-related costs and favorable foreign exchange.
other unallocated expenses increased by $47 million, or 16%, in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to higher inventory obsolescence and other charges and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by continued cost improvements and efficiencies in our manufacturing network.
adjusted net income is an alternative view of performance used by management, and we believe that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. the adjusted net income measure is an important internal measurement for us. additionally, we measure our overall performance on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics. the following are examples of how the adjusted net income measure is utilized:
purchase accounting adjustments adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts that result from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. these impacts, primarily associated with the acquisition of abaxis (acquired in july 2018), the pharmaq business (acquired in november 2015), certain assets of abbott animal health (acquired in february 2015), kah (acquired in 2011), fdah (acquired in 2009), and pharmacia animal health business (acquired in 2003), include amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets and depreciation related to the increase/decrease to fair value of the acquired fixed assets. therefore, the adjusted net income measure includes the revenue earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the aforementioned significant charges.
while certain purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years, this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance. we believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which r&d costs previously have been expensed.
a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted net income. these components of adjusted net income are derived solely from the impact of the items listed above. we have not factored in the impact of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances. for example, our r&d costs in total, and in the periods presented, may have been different; our speed to commercialization and resulting revenue, if any, may have been different; or our costs to manufacture may have been different. in addition, our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers. as such, in total, there can be no assurance that our adjusted net income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets.
acquisition-related costs adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering transaction and integration costs associated with significant business combinations or net asset acquisitions because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to acquire and integrate certain businesses as a result of the acquisition decision. we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies.
we believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees--a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. for this reason, we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the context of a business combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in the ordinary course of business.
the integration costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts generally ending within three years of the transaction. because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy. for example, due to the regulated nature of the animal health medicines and vaccines business, the closure of excess facilities can take several years, as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the fda and/or other regulatory authorities.
certain significant items adjusted net income is calculated excluding certain significant items. certain significant items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature. unusual, in this context, may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be nonrecurring; or items that relate to products that we no longer sell. while not all-inclusive, examples of items that could be considered as certain significant items would be a major non-acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term, such as those related to our non-acquisition-related cost-reduction and productivity initiatives; amounts related to disposals of products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations as defined by u.s. gaap; certain intangible asset impairments; adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions; significant currency devaluation; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax legislation; costs related to our recent ceo transition; or charges related to legal matters. see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 18. commitments and contingencies. our normal, ongoing defense costs or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items.

(a)    the effective tax rate on adjusted pretax income is 18.3%, 18.2% and 18.8% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the higher effective tax rate for 2020, compared with 2019, was primarily attributable to (i) changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, which includes the impact of the location of earnings, repatriation costs, operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and the impact of non-deductible and non-taxable items, (ii) an $18 million net discrete tax benefit recorded in 2019 related to changes in valuation allowances, and (iii) a $4 million and $10 million net discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to the effective settlement of certain issues with tax authorities, partially offset by (i) a $20 million and $4 million net discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to changes in other tax items, and (ii) a $29 million and $20 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to the excess tax benefits for share-based payments.
the lower effective rate in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily due to (i) changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, which reflects the impact of the location of earnings, repatriation costs, operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and the impact of non-deductible and non-taxable items, (ii) an $18 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2019 related to the changes in valuation allowances, (iii) a $10 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2019 related to the effective settlement of certain issues with tax authorities, (iv) a $4 million net discrete tax benefit recorded in 2019 related to changes in various other tax items, and (v) an additional $5 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2019 related to the excess tax benefits for share-based payments, partially offset by the impact of the gilti tax, a new provision to the tax cuts and jobs act, which became effective for the company in the first quarter of 2019.

accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts decreased as a result of timing of customer payments, an increase in rebate credits issued to customers and the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by higher sales in the current period.
property, plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation increased primarily as a result of capital spending, partially offset by depreciation expense and the impact of foreign currency. see notes to consolidated financial statements - note 12. property, plant and equipment identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization decreased primarily due to amortization expense and the impairment of certain intangible assets, partially offset by intangible asset additions from acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange. see notes to consolidated financial statements - note 13. goodwill and other intangible assets accounts payable increased as a result of the timing of payments.
accrued compensation and related items increased primarily due to the accrual of 2020 annual bonuses and savings plan contributions to eligible employees, as well as the timing of payments of payroll taxes and bi-weekly payroll, partially offset by the payments of the 2019 annual bonuses and savings plan contributions to eligible employees.
the net changes in noncurrent deferred tax assets, noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, income taxes payable and other taxes payable primarily reflect adjustments to the accrual for the income tax provision, the timing of income tax payments, the tax impact of various acquisitions, the impact of the remeasurement of deferred taxes as a result of changes in tax rates and the integration of acquired businesses.
other current liabilities increased primarily due to the mark-to-mark adjustment of cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward-exchange contracts.
other noncurrent liabilities increased primarily due to the mark-to-mark adjustment of forward starting interest rate swaps, increase in deferred compensation due to net investment gains and the deferral of fica payroll taxes to be paid in 2022 under the cares act.

operating activities
net cash provided by operating activities was $2,126 million in 2020 compared with $1,795 million in 2019. the increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to higher cash earnings and the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business, partially offset by higher inventory and higher interest payments.
investing activities
net cash used in investing activities was $572 million in 2020 compared with $504 million in 2019. the net cash used in investing activities for 2020 was primarily attributable to capital expenditures, acquisitions and net payments for cross-currency interest rate swaps, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets, including a contingent payment received pursuant to an agreement related to the 2016 sale of certain u.s. manufacturing sites. the net cash used in investing activities for 2019 was primarily due to capital expenditures and the acquisition of platinum performance in the third quarter of 2019, partially offset by proceeds from the maturities of debt securities, proceeds from cross-currency interest rate swaps and proceeds received pursuant to an agreement related to the 2016 sale of certain u.s. manufacturing sites.
financing activities
net cash provided by financing activities was $123 million in 2020 compared with net cash used in financing activities of $951 million in 2019. the net cash provided by financing activities for 2020 was primarily attributable to the proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes in may 2020 and net proceeds in connection with the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plan, partially offset by the repayment of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.450% 2015 senior notes due 2020, payment of dividends and the purchase of treasury shares. the net cash used in financing activities for 2019 was primarily attributable to the purchase of treasury shares, the payment of dividends, the payment of short-
term borrowings and the payments of contingent consideration related to the 2016 acquisition of certain intangible assets related to our livestock product portfolio and the 2018 acquisition of a manufacturing business in ireland.
analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources while we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our operating cash flows and our existing financing arrangements will be sufficient to support our future cash needs, this may be subject to the environment in which we operate. risks to our meeting future funding requirements include global economic conditions described in the following paragraph.
global financial markets may be impacted by macroeconomic, business and financial volatility. as markets change, we will continue to monitor our liquidity position, but there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn will not impact our liquidity or our ability to obtain future financing.
selected measures of liquidity and capital resources certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources follow:
working capital                                             4,441                         2,942
ratio of current assets to current liabilities                    3.05:1                        2.63:1
(a)    accounts receivable are usually collected over a period of 45 to 75 days. for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, the number of days that accounts receivables were outstanding have remained within this range. we regularly monitor our accounts receivable for collectability, particularly in markets where economic conditions remain uncertain. we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate. our assessment is based on such factors as past due aging, historical and expected collection patterns, the financial condition of our customers, the robust nature of our credit and collection practices and the economic environment.
for additional information about the sources and uses of our funds, see the analysis of the consolidated balance sheets and analysis of the consolidated statements of cash flows sections of this md&a.
credit facility and other lines of credit in december 2016, we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks providing for a multi-year $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the credit facility). in december 2018, the maturity for the amended and restated credit facility was extended through december 2023. subject to certain conditions, we have the right to increase the credit facility to up to $1.5 billion. the credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated net debt as of the end of the period to consolidated earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) for such period) of 3.50:1. upon entering into a material acquisition, the maximum total leverage ratio increases to 4.00:1, and extends until the fourth full consecutive fiscal quarter ended immediately following the consummation of a material acquisition.
the credit facility also contains a clause which adds back to adjusted consolidated ebitda, any operational efficiency restructuring charge (defined as charges recorded by the company during the period commencing on october 1, 2016 and ending december 31, 2019, related to operational efficiency initiatives), provided that for any twelve month period such charges added back to adjusted consolidated ebitda shall not exceed $100 million in the aggregate.
the credit facility also contains a financial covenant requiring that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (the ratio of ebitda at the end of the period to interest expense for such period) of 3.50:1. in addition, the credit facility contains other customary covenants.
we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019. there were no amounts drawn under the credit facility as of december 31, 2020 or december 31, 2019.
we have additional lines of credit and other credit arrangements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries for general corporate purposes. we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of our outstanding short-term borrowings. as of december 31, 2020, we had access to $79 million of lines of credit which expire at various times through 2021, and are generally renewed annually. we had $4 million borrowings outstanding related to these facilities as of december 31, 2020 and no borrowings outstanding as of december 31, 2019.
domestic and international short-term funds many of our operations are conducted outside the u.s. the amount of funds held in the u.s. will fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons, such as business development activities. as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of u.s. and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). actual repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional u.s and local income taxes, such as u.s. state income taxes, local withholding taxes, and taxes on currency gains and losses. in addition, the changes imposed by the tax act resulted in a one-time deemed repatriation tax on previously untaxed accumulated earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries in 2018, which is payable over eight years, with the first installment paid in 2019. see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 8. tax matters.
global economic conditions challenging economic conditions in recent years have not had, nor do we anticipate that it will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. due to our operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. as markets change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or a further economic downturn would not impact our ability to obtain financing in the future.

(b)    includes expected employee termination payments that represent contractual obligations, expected payments related to our unfunded u.s. supplemental (non-qualified) savings plans, deferred compensation and expected payments relating to our future benefit payments net of plan assets (included in the determination of the projected benefit obligation) for pension plans that are dedicated to zoetis employees and those transferred to us from pfizer. see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 5. acquisitions and divestitures, note 6. restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions, cost-reduction and productivity initiatives and note 14. benefit plans. excludes approximately $169 million of noncurrent liabilities related to legal and environmental accruals, certain employee termination and exit costs, deferred income and other accruals, most of which do not represent contractual obligations. see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 6. restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions, cost-reduction and productivity initiatives and note 18. commitments and contingencies.
(d)    includes the cost of service credit continuation for certain zoetis employees in the pfizer u.s. qualified defined benefit pension and u.s. retiree medical plans, in accordance with the employee matters agreement. see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 14. benefit plans.
(e)    except for amounts reflected in income taxes payable, we are unable to predict the timing of tax settlements, as tax audits can involve complex issues and the resolution of those issues may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation.
debt securities on october 13, 2020, we redeemed in full the $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.450% 2015 senior notes due 2020 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest to, but not including, the redemption date.
on may 12, 2020, we issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes (2020 senior notes), with an original issue discount of $10 million. these notes are comprised of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.000% senior notes due 2030 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.000% senior notes due 2050. on october 13, 2020, the net proceeds were used to repay the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.450% 2015 senior notes due 2020 and the remainder will be used for general corporate purposes.
on august 20, 2018, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes (2018 senior notes), with an original issue discount of $4 million. on september 12, 2017, we issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes (2017 senior notes), with an original issue discount of $7 million. on november 13, 2015, we issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes (2015 senior notes), with an original issue discount of $2 million. on january 28, 2013, we issued $3.65 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes (2013 senior notes) in a private placement, with an original issue discount of $10 million.
the 2013, 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2020 senior notes are governed by an indenture and supplemental indenture (collectively, the indenture) between us and deutsche bank trust company americas, as trustee. the indenture contains certain covenants, including limitations on our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to incur liens or engage in sale lease-back transactions. the indenture also contains restrictions on our ability to consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of our assets. in addition, the indenture contains other customary terms, including certain events of default, upon the occurrence of which (if not cured or waived), the 2013, 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2020 senior notes may be declared immediately due and payable.
pursuant to the indenture, we are able to redeem the 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2020 senior notes and the 2018 fixed rate senior notes or any series, in whole or in part, at any time by paying a "make whole" premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. the 2018 floating rate senior notes are not redeemable at our option prior to their maturity date. pursuant to our tax matters agreement with pfizer, we will not be permitted to redeem the 2013 senior notes due 2023 pursuant to this optional redemption provision, except under limited circumstances. upon the occurrence of a change of control of us and a downgrade of the 2013, 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2020 senior notes below an investment grade rating by each of moody's investors service, inc. and standard & poor's ratings services, we are, in certain circumstances, required to make an offer
to repurchase all of the outstanding 2013, 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2020 senior notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2013, 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2020 senior notes together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of repurchase.
our outstanding debt securities are as follows:
credit ratings two major corporate debt-rating organizations, moody's and s&p, assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
the following table provides the current ratings assigned by these rating agencies to our commercial paper and senior unsecured non-credit-enhanced long-term debt:
pension obligations our employees ceased to participate in the pfizer u.s. qualified defined benefit and u.s. retiree medical plans effective december 31, 2012, and liabilities associated with our employees under these plans were retained by pfizer. as part of the separation from pfizer, pfizer continued to credit certain employees' service with zoetis generally through december 31, 2017 (or termination of employment from zoetis, if earlier), for certain early retirement benefits with respect to pfizer's u.s. defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans. in connection with the employee matters agreement, zoetis is responsible for payment of three-fifths of the total cost of the service credit continuation (approximately $38 million) for these plans. the amount of the service cost continuation payment to be paid by zoetis to pfizer was determined and fixed based on an actuarial assessment of the value of the grow-in benefits and will be paid in equal installments over a period of 10 years. as of december 31, 2020, the remaining payments due to pfizer (approximately $8 million in the aggregate) are to be paid over the next 2 years.
as part of the separation from pfizer, pfizer transferred to us the net pension obligations associated with certain international defined benefit plans. we expect to contribute a total of approximately $7 million to these plans in 2021.
as of december 31, 2020, the supplemental savings plan liability was approximately $60 million.
for additional information, see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 14. benefit plans.
share repurchase program in december 2018, the company's board of directors authorized a $2.0 billion share repurchase program. as of december 31, 2020, there was approximately $1.4 billion remaining under this authorization. purchases of zoetis shares may be made at the discretion of management, depending on market conditions and business needs. share repurchases may be executed through various means, including open market or privately negotiated transactions. during the first three months of 2020, approximately 1.8 million shares were repurchased. the company temporarily suspended share repurchases beginning in the second quarter of 2020. in january 2021, the company resumed share repurchases under its share repurchase program.
off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses, we may indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to activities prior to a transaction. these indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters, and patent-infringement claims. if the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse the loss. these indemnifications are generally subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications are not significant.

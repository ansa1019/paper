item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
introduction the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 of this annual report. in addition, please see "information regarding non-gaap measures and other" beginning on page 34 for a reconciliation of the non-gaap measures for adjusted total revenues, organic commission, fee and supplemental revenues and adjusted ebitdac to the comparable gaap measures, as well as other important information regarding these measures.
we are engaged in providing insurance brokerage and consulting services, and third-party property/casualty claims settlement and administration services to entities in the u.s. and abroad.  we believe that one of our major strengths is our ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to our clients.  our brokers, agents and administrators act as intermediaries between underwriting enterprises and our clients and we do not assume net underwriting risks.  we are headquartered in rolling meadows, illinois, have operations in 49 countries and offer client-service capabilities in more than 150 countries globally through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants.  in 2020, we expanded, and expect to continue to expand, our international operations through both acquisitions and organic growth.  we generate approximately 68% of our revenues for the combined brokerage and risk management segments domestically, with the remaining 32% generated internationally, primarily in the u.k., australia, canada, new zealand and bermuda (based on 2020 revenues).  we expect that our international revenue as a percentage of our total revenues in 2021 will be comparable to 2020. we have three reportable segments: brokerage, risk management and corporate, which contributed approximately 74%, 14% and 12%, respectively, to 2020 revenues.  our major sources of operating revenues are commissions, fees and supplemental and contingent revenues from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations.  investment income is generated from invested cash and fiduciary funds, clean energy investments, and interest income from premium financing.
this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain statements relating to future results which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.  please see "information concerning forward-looking statements" at the beginning of this annual report, for certain cautionary information regarding forward-looking statements and a list of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forward-looking statements.

in our corporate segment, net after tax earnings from our clean energy investments was $69.8 million and $88.5 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.  our current estimate of the 2021 annual net after tax earnings, including irc section 45 tax credits, which will be produced from all of our clean energy investments in 2021, is $60.0 million to $75.0 million.  we expect to use the additional cash flow generated by these earnings to continue our mergers and acquisition strategy in our core brokerage and risk management operations.

covid-19 impact in our property/casualty brokerage operations, during fourth quarter 2020, (a) our customer retention remained at pre‐pandemic levels, (b) new business generation was above pre-pandemic levels, offset somewhat by non-recurring business that was below pre‐pandemic levels, (c) renewal exposure units (i.e., insured values, payrolls, employees, miles driven, etc.) declined; however, premium rates across most geographies and lines of coverage have continued to increase, effectively mitigating exposure unit declines, and (d) net positive mid-term policy modifications were slightly higher than fourth quarter 2019.
thus far in the first quarter of 2021, property/casualty customer exposure unit renewals showed improvement compared to lows seen in april and may 2020, as our customers' businesses continue to recover and economic activity increases. full policy cancellations have remained similar to pre-pandemic levels, and we continue to see property/casualty premium rates move higher overall which may partially, or fully, offset future declines in exposure units, if any.
in our employee benefits brokerage operations, during the fourth quarter of 2020 we saw a decrease in new consulting and special project work, while covered lives on renewal business were similar to the third quarter of 2020.  our january 1, 2021 health and welfare renewals have shown covered lives being consistent with levels seen in the fourth quarter of 2020, although still not at pre-pandemic levels.  consulting engagements and special project work improved slightly from fourth quarter levels, but are still below pre‐pandemic levels.  we believe revenue softness related to reduced covered lives and lower frequency of special project work could persist over the next few quarters, and even deteriorate further, if the economy is slow to recover.
throughout 2020 and in the fourth quarter of 2020, our clean energy investments experienced the impact of lower electricity consumption in the u.s., when compared to the same periods in 2019, due to reduced economic activity (as well as, unrelated to covid-19, milder temperatures, other than some brief periods of unusually warm weather, falling natural gas prices, and increased use of renewable energy sources).  we expect reduced u.s. electricity consumption could persist at least through the first half of 2021, and could even continue throughout all of 2021.
of our nearly 1,000 office locations, nearly 400 are open, but most at reduced capacity.  accordingly the vast majority of our employees continue to work remotely for some or all of their work week.  we believe our service levels are unchanged from pre-pandemic levels.  we have not had any office-wide outbreaks of covid-19, and fewer than 300 confirmed cases among our 32,401 employees - all of which we believe contracted the virus outside of our office locations.
given the deterioration in economic conditions, since the first quarter of 2020, we are actively managing costs by limiting discretionary spending such as travel, entertainment and advertising expenses, adjusting our real estate footprint, reducing capital expenditures, limiting use of outside labor and consultants, increasing utilization of our centers of excellence, and we have adjusted portions of our workforce where volumes have declined significantly and normal attrition was not sufficient.
the cost saving impact of these actions in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020 was substantial; with estimated quarterly savings of approximately $65 million to $70 million pretax compared to the same quarters in 2019, as adjusted for pro forma full‐quarter costs related to acquisitions.  offsetting these savings were severance and lease termination costs related to these actions.  we believe savings in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 could again total approximately $60 million to $65 million pretax after adjusting for pro forma costs related to acquisitions.  offsetting possible future savings would be additional implementation and execution costs, which we estimate could total approximately $12 million to $15 million pretax.  future net savings may be lower if the economy recovers faster than we are forecasting or our costs to implement changes exceed our estimates.
we have not seen any meaningful decline in cash receipts from our clients to date and we have more than $1.6 billion of available liquidity.  a prolonged period of economic weakness may cause future cash collections to deteriorate, but we believe our cost savings, reduced non-client facing capital expenditures and working capital improvements could mitigate a potential decline in our cash flows over the near‐term.

update on ransomware incident as previously disclosed, on september 26, 2020, we detected a ransomware incident impacting our internal systems.  we implemented our incident response plan, took our global systems offline, isolated impacted systems, retained cyber security counsel and forensic experts and reported the event to the fbi.  the incident has been contained, and all critical systems are back in service.
while we remain unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of information, our investigation into the incident remains ongoing. we are working to conclude our forensic investigation and determine the nature and extent of unauthorized access to information on our systems.  we intend to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.  based on the results of the forensic investigation to date, we do not believe this incident will have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.
we maintain cyber liability insurance coverage, but disputes over the extent of insurance coverage for claims are not uncommon. furthermore, while we have not been the subject of any legal proceedings involving this incident, it is possible we could be the subject of claims from persons alleging they suffered damages from the incident, or actions by governmental authorities.
insurance market overview fluctuations in premiums charged by property/casualty underwriting enterprises have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry.  commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels.  insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions.  various factors, including competition for market share among underwriting enterprises, increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations, can result in flat or reduced property/casualty premium rates (a "soft" market).  a soft market tends to put downward pressure on commission revenues.  various countervailing factors, such as greater than anticipated loss experience, unexpected loss exposure and capital shortages, can result in increasing property/casualty premium rates (a "hard" market).  a hard market tends to favorably impact commission revenues.  hard and soft markets may be broad-based or more narrowly focused across individual product lines or geographic areas.  as markets harden, buyers of insurance (such as our brokerage clients), have historically tried to mitigate premium increases and the higher commissions these premiums generate, including by raising their deductibles and/or reducing the overall amount of insurance coverage they purchase.  as the market softens, or costs decrease, these trends have historically reversed.  during a hard market, buyers may switch to negotiated fee in lieu of commission arrangements to compensate us for placing their risks, or may consider the alternative insurance market, which includes self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and capital market solutions to transfer risk.  our brokerage units are very active in these markets as well.  while increased use by insureds of these alternative markets historically has reduced commission revenue to us, such trends generally have been accompanied by new sales and renewal increases in the areas of risk management, claims management, captive insurance and self-insurance services and related growth in fee revenue.  inflation tends to increase the levels of insured values and risk exposures, resulting in higher overall premiums and higher commissions.  however, the impact of hard and soft market fluctuations has historically had a greater impact on changes in premium rates, and therefore on our revenues, than inflationary pressures.
we typically cite the council of insurance agents & brokers (which we refer to as the ciab) insurance pricing quarterly survey at this time as an indicator of the current insurance rate environment.  the fourth quarter 2020 survey had not been published as of the filing date of this report.  the first three 2020 quarterly surveys indicated that u.s. commercial property/casualty rates increased by 9.3%, 10.8%, and 11.7% on average, for the first, second and third quarters of 2020, respectively.  we expect a similar trend to be noted when the ciab fourth quarter 2020 survey report is issued, which would signal overall continued price firming and hardening in some items.  the ciab represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers, who write approximately 85% of the commercial property/casualty premiums in the u.s.
we believe the increases in property/casualty rates experienced in 2020, will continue in 2021; however, loss trends could deteriorate, leading to a more difficult environment and, in certain lines and geographies, a hard market. the economies of the u.s. and other countries around the world contracted during 2020 as a result of covid-19 and have yet to rebound to pre-pandemic levels. weaker economic activity is leading to, and is likely to continue to lead to, reduced exposure units and elevated unemployment. we expect that our history of strong new business generation, solid retentions and enhanced value-added services for our carrier partners should help offset, to a degree, softer global economic conditions. overall, we believe that in a positive rate environment with reduced exposure units, our professionals can demonstrate their expertise and high-quality, value-added capabilities by strengthening our clients' insurance portfolios and delivering insurance and risk management solutions within our clients' budget. based on our experience, there is adequate capacity in the insurance market for most lines of coverage, terms and conditions are tightening, most insurance carriers appear to be making rational pricing decisions and clients can broadly still obtain coverage.
clean energy investments - we have investments in limited liability companies that own 29 clean coal production plants developed by us and six clean coal production plants we purchased from a third party.  all 35 plants produce refined coal using propriety technologies owned by chem-mod.  we believe that the production and sale of refined coal at these plants are qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45.  the plants which were placed in service prior to december 31, 2009 (which we refer to as the 2009 era plants) received tax credits through 2019 and the 21 plants which were placed in service prior to december 31, 2011 (which we refer to as the 2011 era plants) can receive tax credits through 2021.  all twenty-one of the 2011 era plants are under long‐term production contracts with several utilities.
we also own a 46.5% controlling interest in chem-mod, which has been marketing the chem‐modtm solution proprietary technologies principally to refined fuel plants that sell refined fuel to coal-fired power plants owned by utility companies, including those plants in which we hold interests.  based on current production estimates provided by licensees, chem-mod could generate for us approximately $5.0 million to $6.0 million of net after tax earnings per quarter for the first three quarters of 2021.
our current estimate of the 2021 annual net after tax earnings, including irc section 45 tax credits, which will be produced from all of our clean energy investments in 2020, is $60.0 million to $75.0 million.
all estimates set forth above regarding the future results of our clean energy investments are subject to significant risks, including those set forth in the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a, "risk factors."
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  we believe the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.  see note 1 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies.
revenue recognition - see revenue recognition in notes 1 and 4 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements.
uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment.  subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition and measurement.  adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue.  we recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes.  see note 19 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the possibility that our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months.
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax returns at different times than such items are reflected in the financial statements.  as a result, the annual tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings is different than that reported in our tax returns.  some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax returns, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense and amortization expense deductible for income tax purposes.  temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.  deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which a tax payment has been deferred, or expense which has been deducted in the tax return but has not yet been recognized in the financial statements.  deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements.  on july 22, 2020, the u.k. enacted the finance act and stamp duty land tax which maintained the u.k. corporate tax rate at 19% from april 1, 2020 (previously planned to be reduced to 17% on that date).  accordingly, we adjusted our deferred tax asset and liability balances in third quarter 2020 to reflect this rate change.
we establish or adjust valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in a specific jurisdiction.  in assessing the need for the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly.  we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence as part of our analysis.  negative evidence includes the existence of losses in recent years.  positive evidence includes the forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, tax-planning strategies that would result in the realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years.  the underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account our recent performance.  such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein.  the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible or creditable.  see note 19 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements related to changes in our valuation allowances.
current accounting guidance related to business combinations requires us to estimate and recognize the fair value of liabilities related to potential earnout obligations as of the acquisition dates for all of our acquisitions subject to earnout provisions.  the maximum potential earnout payables disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements represent the maximum amount of additional consideration that could be paid pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement for the applicable acquisition.  the amounts recorded as earnout payables, which are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two- to three-year period subsequent to the acquisition date, are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price consideration.  we will record subsequent changes in these estimated earnout obligations, including the accretion of discount, in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred.
the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements, which is a level 3 fair value
measurement.  in determining fair value, we estimate the acquired entity's future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth and/or profitability.  we estimate future payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections.  we then discount these payments to present value using a risk-adjusted rate that takes into consideration market-based rates of return that reflect the ability of the acquired entity to achieve the targets.  changes in financial projections, market participant assumptions for revenue growth and/or profitability, or the risk-adjusted discount rate, would result in a change in the fair value of recorded earnout obligations.  see note  to our 2020 consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our 2020 business combinations.
business combinations and dispositions see note 3 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our 2020 business combinations.  we did not have any material dispositions in 2018.
on january 8, 2019, we sold a travel insurance brokerage operation that was initially purchased in 2014.  in first quarter 2019, we recognized a one-time, net gain of $0.17 of diluted net earnings per share as a result of the sale.
results of operations information regarding non-gaap measures and other in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations that follows, in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with gaap, we provide information regarding ebitdac, ebitdac margin, adjusted ebitdac, adjusted ebitdac margin, diluted net earnings per share, as adjusted (adjusted eps), adjusted revenues, adjusted compensation and operating expenses, adjusted compensation expense ratio, adjusted operating expense ratio and organic revenue.  these measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, the gaap information provided in this report. we believe that these presentations provide useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our results of operations and financial condition because they provide investors with measures that our chief operating decision maker uses when reviewing the company's performance, and for the other reasons described below.  our industry peers may provide similar supplemental non-gaap information with respect to one or more of these measures, although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments.  the non-gaap information we provide should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the gaap information provided.  we make determinations regarding certain elements of executive officer incentive compensation, performance share awards and annual cash incentive awards, partly on the basis of measures related to adjusted ebitdac.
adjusted non-gaap presentation - we believe that the adjusted non-gaap presentation of our 2020 and 2019 information, presented on the following pages, provides stockholders and other interested persons with useful information regarding certain financial metrics that may assist such persons in analyzing our operating results as they develop a future earnings outlook for us.  the after-tax amounts related to the adjustments were computed using the normalized effective tax rate for each respective period.
o   net losses or gains on divestitures, which are primarily net losses or proceeds received related to sales of books of business and other divestiture transactions, such as the disposal of a business through sale or closure.
o   costs related to divestitures, which include legal and other costs related to certain operations that are being exited by us.
o   acquisition integration costs, which include costs related to certain large acquisitions, outside the scope of our usual tuck-in strategy, not expected to occur on an ongoing basis in the future once we fully assimilate the applicable acquisition. these costs are typically associated with redundant workforce, extra lease space, duplicate services and external costs incurred to assimilate the acquisition with our it related systems.
o   workforce related charges, which primarily include severance costs (either accrued or paid) related to employee terminations and other costs associated with redundant workforce.
o   acquisition related adjustments, which include change in estimated acquisition earnout payables adjustments, impairment charges and acquisition related compensation charges. prior to first quarter 2019, this adjustment also reflected impacts of acquisition valuation true-ups.
o   the impact of foreign currency translation, as applicable. the amounts excluded with respect to foreign currency translation are calculated by applying current year foreign exchange rates to the same period in the prior year.
o   effective income tax rate impact, which represents the impact in third quarter 2020 of one-time taxes associated with the realignment of our operations to continue to conduct certain business in the eu after brexit and the change in the u.k. effective income tax rate from 17.5% to 19%. in addition, it also includes the impact in third quarter 2019 related to prior quarters in 2019 for the decrease in the u.s. effective income tax rate used to compute the provision for income taxes in fourth quarter 2019.
non-gaap earnings measures we believe that the presentation of ebitdac, ebitdac margin, adjusted ebitdac, adjusted ebitdac margin and adjusted eps for the brokerage and risk management segment, each as defined below, provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance.  adjusted eps is a performance measure and should not be used as a measure of our liquidity.  we also consider ebitdac and ebitdac margin as ways to measure financial performance on an ongoing basis.  in addition, adjusted ebitdac, adjusted ebitdac margin and adjusted eps for the brokerage and risk management segments are presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability.
•   ebitdac and ebitdac margin - ebitdac is net earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables and ebitdac margin is ebitdac divided by total revenues (for the brokerage segment) and revenues before reimbursements (for the risk management segment). these measures for the brokerage and risk management segments provide a meaningful representation of our operating performance for the overall business and provide a meaningful way to measure its financial performance on an ongoing basis.
•   adjusted ebitdac and adjusted ebitdac margin - adjusted ebitdac is ebitdac adjusted to exclude net losses or gains on divestitures, acquisition integration costs, workforce related charges, lease termination related charges, acquisition related adjustments, and the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation, as applicable and adjusted ebitdac margin is adjusted ebitdac divided by total adjusted revenues (defined above). these measures for the brokerage and risk management segments provide a meaningful representation of our operating performance, and are also presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability.
•   adjusted eps and adjusted net earnings - adjusted net earnings have been adjusted to exclude the after-tax impact of net losses or gains on divestitures, acquisition integration costs, workforce related charges, lease termination related charges, acquisition related adjustments, the impact of foreign currency translation and effective income tax rate impact, as applicable. adjusted eps is adjusted net earnings divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. this measure provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance (and as such should not be used as a measure of our liquidity), and for the overall business is also presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability.
organic revenues (a non-gaap measure) - for the brokerage segment, organic change in base commission and fee revenues, supplemental revenues and contingent revenues excludes the first twelve months of such revenues generated from acquisitions and such revenues related to divested operations in each year presented.  these revenues are excluded from organic revenues in order to help interested persons analyze the revenue growth associated with the operations that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year.  in addition, organic change in base commission and fee revenues, supplemental revenues and contingent revenues exclude the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation.  for the risk management segment, organic change in fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of fee revenues generated from acquisitions and the fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented.  in addition, change in organic growth excludes the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability, or are due to the limited-time nature of these revenue sources.
these revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable, but non-gaap, measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that are expected to continue in 2021 and beyond.  we have historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our brokerage and risk
reconciliation of non-gaap information presented to gaap measures - this report includes tabular reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures for adjusted revenues, adjusted compensation expense and adjusted operating expense, ebitdac, ebitdac margin, adjusted ebitdac, adjusted ebitdac margin, adjusted ebitdac (before acquisitions), diluted net earnings per share (as adjusted) and organic revenue measures.
(i)   identifying, negotiating and placing all forms of insurance or reinsurance coverage, as well as providing risk-shifting, risk-sharing and risk-mitigation consulting services, principally related to property/casualty, life, health, welfare and disability insurance. we also provide these services through, or in conjunction with, other unrelated agents and brokers, consultants and management advisors.
(ii)   acting as an agent or broker for multiple underwriting enterprises by providing services such as sales, marketing, selecting, negotiating, underwriting, servicing and placing insurance coverage on their behalf.
(iii)   providing consulting services related to health and welfare benefits, voluntary benefits, executive benefits, compensation, retirement planning, institutional investment and fiduciary, actuarial, compliance, private insurance exchange, human resource technology, communications and benefits administration.
(iv)   providing management and administrative services to captives, pools, risk-retention groups, healthcare exchanges, small underwriting enterprises, such as accounting, claims and loss processing assistance, feasibility studies, actuarial studies, data analytics and other administrative services.
the primary source of revenues for our brokerage services is commissions from underwriting enterprises, based on a percentage of premiums paid by our clients, or fees received from clients based on an agreed level of service usually in lieu of commissions.  commissions are fixed at the contract effective date and generally are based on a percentage of premiums for insurance coverage or employee headcount for employer sponsored benefit plans.  commissions depend upon a large number of factors, including the type of risk being placed, the particular underwriting enterprise's demand, the expected loss experience of the particular risk of coverage, and historical benchmarks surrounding the level of effort necessary for us to place and service the insurance contract.  rather than being tied to the amount of premiums, fees are most often based on an expected level of effort to provide our services.  in addition, under certain circumstances, both retail brokerage and wholesale brokerage services receive supplemental and contingent revenues.  supplemental revenue is revenue paid by an underwriting enterprise that is above the base commission paid, is determined by the underwriting enterprise and is established annually in advance of the contractual period based on historical performance criteria.  contingent revenue is revenue paid by an underwriting enterprise based on the overall profit and/or volume of the business placed with that underwriting enterprise during a particular calendar year and is determined after the contractual period.
litigation, regulatory and taxation matters irs and doj investigations - as previously disclosed, our irc 831(b) (or "micro-captive") advisory services business has been under investigation by the irs since 2013.  among other matters, the irs is investigating whether we have been acting as a tax shelter promoter in connection with these operations.  additionally, the irs has initiated audits for the 2012 tax year, and subsequent tax years, of over 100 of the micro-captive underwriting enterprises organized and/or managed by us.  in may 2020, we learned that the doj is conducting a criminal investigation related to irc 831(b) micro-captive underwriting enterprises. we have been advised that we are not currently a target of the investigation.  in june 2020, our subsidiary artex risk solutions, inc. (which we refer to as artex) received a grand jury subpoena requesting documents relating to its micro-captive advisory business.  we have produced documents in response to the subpoena.  we are fully cooperating with both the irs investigation and the doj investigation.  we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss in connection with these investigations.
class action lawsuit - on december 7, 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against us, artex and other defendants, in the united states district court for the district of arizona.  the named plaintiffs are micro-captives and their related entities and owners who had irc section 831(b) tax benefits disallowed by the irs.  on august 5, 2019, the trial court granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and dismissed the class action lawsuit.  plaintiffs appealed this ruling to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit.  on september 9, 2020, the ninth circuit affirmed the ruling of the trial court dismissing the class action lawsuit.  we will continue to defend against the lawsuit vigorously. litigation is inherently uncertain, however, and it is not possible for us to predict
the ultimate outcome of this matter and the financial impact to us, nor are we able to reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss in connection with this lawsuit.

commissions and fees - the aggregate increase in base commissions and fees for 2020 was due to revenues associated with acquisitions that were made during 2020 and 2019 ($234.9 million) and organic revenue growth.  commission revenues increased 8% and fee revenues increased 6% in 2020 compared to 2019, respectively.  the organic change in base commission and fee revenues was 3% in 2020 and 6% in 2019.
in our property/casualty brokerage operations, during the three-month period ended december 31, 2020, relative to same period in 2019, our customer (a) retention and new business generation both remained at pre-pandemic levels, (b) non-recurring business was lower than pre-pandemic levels, (c) renewal exposure units (i.e., insured values, payrolls, employees, miles driven, etc.) showed some decline; however, premium rates across most geographies and lines of coverage have continued to increase, effectively mitigating exposure unit decline, and (d) net positive mid-term policy modifications were also lower.  thus far in the first quarter of 2021, property/casualty renewal customer exposure units and showed improvement compared to lows seen in april and may as our customers' businesses continue to recover. full policy cancellations have remained similar to pre-pandemic levels, and we continue to see property/casualty premium rates move higher overall which may partially, or fully, offset future declines in exposure units, if any.  in our employee benefits brokerage operations, during the three-month period ended december 31, 2020 relative to same period in 2019, and thus far in the first quarter of 2021, we saw a decrease in new consulting and frequency of special project work (although we did sell a large life insurance pension funding product) and a decrease in covered lives on renewal business, although not to the same extent as headline unemployment levels.  we believe the decline in covered lives and lower frequency of special project work could persist over the next few quarters, and even deteriorate further, if the economy is slow to recover.
items excluded from organic revenue computations yet impacting revenue comparisons for 2020 and 2019 include the following (in millions):
less commission and fee revenues from acquisitions              (234.9     )                    -
less supplemental revenues from acquisitions                      (3.5     )                    -

for 2020 and 2019, we issued 1,857,000 and 1,908,000 shares of our common stock at the request of sellers and/or in connection with tax-free exchange acquisitions, respectively.
investment income and net gains on divestitures - this primarily represents (1) interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and restricted funds and interest income from premium financing and (2) net (losses) gains related to divestitures and sales of books of business, which were $(5.8) million and $75.3 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. on december 16, 2020, we completed the sale of a u.k. wealth management business we purchased over four years ago that no longer strategically fit in our benefits operations. in fourth quarter 2020, we recognized a net pretax non-cash loss on the sale of approximately $12.0 million, primarily due to the write‐off of the remaining net book value of the amortizable intangible assets.  during 2019, we recognized a one-time, net gain of $0.17 of diluted net earnings per share related to the divestiture of a travel insurance brokerage and four other smaller brokerage operations.

acquisition related adjustments                     (19.2   )              (16.8   )
the $136.6 million increase in compensation expense in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to compensation associated with the acquisitions completed in 2020 - $26.3 million, producer compensation - $69.4 million, and other incentive compensation linked to operating results and deferred compensation ($45.8 million in the aggregate), partially offset by decreases in temporary-staffing and other related costs - $4.9 million.
acquisition integration                                      (10.2   )               (8.0   )
the decrease in operating expense in 2020 compared to 2019 was due primarily to savings in meeting and client entertainment expense, office supplies and other occupancy costs, professional and banking fees and marketing expense - $135.3 million, partially offset by expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in 2020 - $6.7 million and increased business insurance - $19.3 million.
depreciation - the increase in depreciation expense in 2020 compared to 2019 was due primarily to the impact of purchases of furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements related to office expansions and moves, and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems.  also contributing to the increases in depreciation expense in 2020 was the depreciation expense associated with acquisitions completed in 2020.
amortization - the increase in amortization in 2020 compared to 2019 was due primarily to the write-off of amortizable assets in 2020 and additional amortization expense of intangible assets associated with acquisitions completed in 2020 and 2019.  expiration lists, non‐compete agreements and trade names are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives (two to fifteen years for expiration lists, two to six years for non-compete agreements and two to fifteen years for trade names).  based on the results of impairment reviews performed on amortizable intangible assets in 2020 and 2019, we wrote off $51.5 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of amortizable intangible assets related to the brokerage segment. we review all of our intangible assets for impairment periodically (at least annually for goodwill) and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.  we perform such impairment reviews at the division (i.e., reporting unit) level with respect to goodwill and at the business unit level for amortizable intangible assets.  in reviewing amortizable intangible assets, if the undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the respective (or underlying) asset, an indicator of impairment would exist and further analysis would be required to determine whether or not a loss would need to be charged against current period earnings as a component of amortization expense.  in consideration of the potential impacts of covid-19 on our reporting units, we performed a qualitative impairment review on carrying value of our goodwill for all of our reporting units as of december 31, 2020 and no indicators of impairment were noted.
change in estimated acquisition earnout payables - the change in the expense from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in 2020 compared to 2019 was due primarily to adjustments made to the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance.  during 2020 and 2019, we recognized $32.0 million and $26.2 million, respectively, of expense related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our 2020 and 2019 acquisitions.  during 2020 and 2019, we recognized $61.7 million and $9.3 million of income, respectively, related to net adjustments in the estimated fair market values of earnout obligations in connection with revised projections of future performance for 131 and 112 acquisitions, respectively.
the amounts initially recorded as earnout payables for our 2016 to 2020 acquisitions were measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are primarily based upon the estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two- to three‐year period subsequent to the acquisition date.  the fair value of these earnout obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired entities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements.  in determining fair value, we estimate the acquired entity's future performance using financial projections developed by management for the acquired entity and market participant assumptions that were derived for revenue growth and/or profitability.  we estimate future earnout payments using the earnout formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement and these financial projections.  subsequent changes in the underlying financial projections or assumptions will cause the estimated earnout obligations to change and such adjustments are recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings when incurred.  increases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of expense and decreases in the earnout payable obligations will result in the recognition of income.
net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests - the amounts reported in this line for 2020 and 2019 include noncontrolling interest earnings of $4.9 million and $17.2 million, respectively, of which for 2019 primarily related to our investment in capsicum reinsurance brokers llp (which we refer to as capsicum re).  prior to december 31, 2019, we were partners in this venture with grahame chilton, the former ceo of our international brokerage division (who stepped down from the role effective july 1, 2018).  we were the controlling partner, participating in 33% of capsicum re's net operating results and mr. chilton owned approximately 50% of capsicum re.  in january 2020, we increased our ownership interest in capsicum re from 33% to 100%.  founded in december 2013 through a strategic partnership with gallagher, capsicum re has since grown to become the world's fifth largest reinsurance broker with offices in the u.k., u.s., bermuda and south america.
risk management the risk management segment accounted for 14% of our revenue in 2020.  our risk management segment operations provide contract claim settlement, claim administration, loss control services and risk management consulting for commercial, not for profit, captive and public entities, and various other organizations that choose to self-insure property/casualty coverages or choose to use a third-party claims management organization rather than the claim services provided by underwriting enterprises.  revenues for the risk management segment are comprised of fees generally negotiated (i) on a per-claim or per-service basis, (ii) on a cost-plus basis, or (iii) as performance-based fees.  we also provide risk management consulting services that are recognized as the services are delivered.

items excluded from organic fee computations yet impacting revenue comparisons in 2020 and 2019 include the following (in millions):
less fees from acquisitions                        (7.4     )                  -
reimbursements - reimbursements represent amounts received from clients reimbursing us for certain third-party costs associated with providing our claims management services.  in certain service partner relationships, we are considered a principal because we direct the third party, control the specified service and combine the services provided into an integrated solution.  given this principal relationship, we are required to recognize revenue on a gross basis and service partner vendor fees in the operating expense line in our consolidated statement of earnings. the increase in reimbursements in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to a change in business mix that is processed internally versus using outside service partners.
depreciation - depreciation expense increased in 2020 compared to 2019, which reflects the impact of purchases of furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements related to office expansions and moves and expenditures related to upgrading computer systems.
change in estimated acquisition earnout payables - the change in expense from the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables in 2020 compared to 2019, were due primarily to adjustments made in 2020 and 2019 to the estimated fair value of an earnout obligation related to revised projections of future performance.  during 2020 and 2019, we recognized $0.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of expense related to the accretion of the discount recorded for earnout obligations in connection with our 2018 and 2017 acquisitions, respectively.  during 2020, we recognized $3.7 million of income related to net adjustments in the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance for four acquisitions.  during 2019, we recognized $2.4 million of income related to net adjustments in the estimated fair value of earnout obligations related to revised projections of future performance for four acquisitions.

•   revenues from consolidated clean coal production plants represents revenues from the consolidated irc section 45 facilities in which we have a majority ownership position and maintain control over the operations at the related facilities.
•   royalty income from clean coal licenses represents revenues related to chem-mod llc. we hold a 46.5% controlling interest in chem-mod llc. as chem-mod llc's manager, we are required to consolidate its operations.
expenses related to royalty income of chem‐mod llc were $10.6 million and $17.5 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.  these expenses are included in the operating expenses discussed below.  in 2019, chem-mod llc, incurred costs related to settling certain patent infringement litigation.
•   loss from unconsolidated clean coal production plants represents our equity portion of the pretax operating results from the unconsolidated irc section 45 facilities. the production of refined coal generates pretax operating losses.
the losses in 2020 and 2019 were low because the vast majority of our operations are consolidated.
operating expense - operating expense for 2020 includes banking and related fees of $5.1 million, external professional fees and other due diligence costs related to 2020 acquisitions of $9.4 million, other corporate and clean energy related expenses, including legal fees, and costs related to corporate data and branding initiatives, of $41.9 million, and a net unrealized foreign exchange remeasurement loss of $0.3 million operating expense for 2019 includes banking and related fees of $4.7 million, external professional fees and other due diligence costs related to 2019 acquisitions of $17.4 million, other corporate and clean energy related expenses of $35.8 million, $11.9 million of clean energy related costs as described on page 47, corporate related data and branding initiatives of $11.9 million, a net realized loss related to foreign exchange hedge contacts of $3.3 million and a net unrealized foreign exchange remeasurement loss of $2.1 million.

benefit for income taxes - we allocate the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments using local statutory rates.  as a result, the provision for income taxes for the corporate segment reflects the entire benefit to us of the irc section 45 credits generated, because that is the segment which produced the credits.  the law that provides for irc section 45 tax credits expired in december 2019 for our fourteen 2009 era plants and is scheduled to expire in december 2021 for our twenty-one 2011 era plants.  our consolidated effective tax rate was 1.5%, and (14.3)% for 2020 and 2019, respectively.  the tax rates for 2020 and 2019 were lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the amount of irc section 45 tax credits recognized during the year.  there were $148.6 million and $196.0 million of section 45 tax credits generated and recognized in 2020 and 2019, respectively.  the
income tax benefit of stock based awards that vested or were settled in the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 was $25.3 million and $17.4 million, respectively.
u.s. federal income tax law changes - on march 27, 2020, the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act (cares act) was enacted in response to the covid-19 pandemic.  the cares act contains several significant business tax provisions that could affect a company's accounting for income taxes.  see discussion of the various impact of the cares act below.
u.s. federal income tax law changes items impacting the company going forward alternative minimum tax credit - the cares act amends section 53(e) of the tcja so that all prior year minimum tax credits are available for refund for the first taxable year of a corporation beginning in 2018.  we have adjusted the classification of the remaining alternative minimum tax (which we refer to as amt) credits as a result of the amt credit acceleration.  all remaining amt credits were utilized as part of our 2019 federal income tax return or refunded in 2020.
interest expense limitation - the cares act contains modifications on the limitations of business interest for tax years beginning in 2019 and 2020.  the modifications to section 163(j) increase the allowable business interest deduction from 30% of adjusted taxable income to 50% of adjusted taxable income.  this modification would significantly increase the allowable interest expense deduction of the company.  we have evaluated the impact and determined there is no limit on our interest deductibility for federal income tax purposes for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019.

(4)   during third quarter of 2019, we and/or our 46.5% owned affiliate, chem-mod llc, incurred costs related to (a) settling certain litigation, (b) prevailing in a tax court matter, (c) defending a new patent matter, and (d) moving three 2011 era plants into different locations that generated more after-tax earnings in 2020 than in 2019.
acquisition costs - consists of professional fees, due diligence and other costs incurred related to our acquisitions.
corporate - consists of overhead allocations mostly related to corporate staff compensation and other corporate level activities, costs related to biennial company-wide award event, cross-selling and motivational meetings for our production staff and field management, expenses related to our new corporate headquarters, corporate related data and branding initiatives, expenses for systems and consulting related to the implementation of the new revenue recognition accounting and tax reform rules and the impact of foreign currency translation.
the income tax benefit of stock based awards that vested or were settled in the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 was $25.3 million and $17.4 million, respectively, and is included in the table above in the corporate line.
impact of u.k. brexit decision - during the third and fourth quarters of 2020, our u.k. operations completed the transfer of its eea books of business to a gallagher eu affiliate in connection with the u.k. exiting the eu on december 31, 2020.  the transfer related after-tax charges reported in 2020 were a net $1.1 million of income tax benefit, reflecting the amortization of those assets at the swedish tax rate and utilization of historical u.k. capital losses that previously had valuation allowances against them.
clean energy investments - we have investments in limited liability companies that own 29 clean coal production plants developed by us and six clean coal production plants we purchased from a third party.  all 35 plants produce refined coal using propriety technologies owned by chem-mod llc.  we believe that the production and sale of refined coal at these plants are qualified to receive refined coal tax credits under irc section 45.  the 14 2009 era plants received tax credits through 2019 and the 21 2011 era plants can receive tax credits through 2021.
the estimated earnings information in the table reflects management's current best estimate of the 2020 low and high ranges of after-tax earnings based on early production estimates from the host utilities, other operating assumptions, including current u.s. federal income tax laws.  however, coal-fired power plants may not ultimately produce refined fuel at estimated levels due to seasonal electricity demand, production costs, natural gas prices, weather conditions, as well as many other operational, regulatory and environmental compliance reasons.  future changes in epa regulations or u.s. federal income tax laws might materially impact these estimates.
our investment in chem-mod llc generates royalty income from refined coal production plants owned by those limited liability companies in which we invest as well as refined coal production plants owned by other unrelated parties.  future changes in epa regulations or u.s. federal income tax laws might materially impact these estimates.
we may sell ownership interests in some or all of the plants to co-investors and relinquish control of the plants, thereby becoming a noncontrolling, minority investor.  in any limited liability company where we are a noncontrolling, minority investor, the membership agreement for the operations contains provisions that preclude an individual member from being able to make major decisions that would denote control.  as of any future date we become a noncontrolling, minority investor, we would deconsolidate the entity and subsequently account for the investment using equity method accounting.
we currently have construction commitments related to our refined coal plants of approximately $0.9 million.
there is a provision in irc section 45 that phases out the tax credits if the coal reference price per ton, based on market prices, reaches certain levels as follows:
(1)   the irs will not release the factors for 2021 until april or may 2021. based on our analysis of the factors used in the irs' phase out calculations, it is our belief that there will be no phase out in 2021.
see the risk factors regarding our irc section 45 investments under item 1a, "risk factors." for a more detailed discussion of these and other factors could impact the information above.  see note 14 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements for more information regarding risks and uncertainties related to these investments.
financial condition and liquidity liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations.  the insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive.  historically, our capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on our common stock, repurchases of our common stock, funding of our investments, acquisitions of brokerage and risk management operations and capital expenditures.
in light of the economic uncertainty caused by covid-19, subsequent to the first quarter of 2020, we preserved liquidity during 2020 by reducing capital expenditures for the remainder of the year and made working capital process changes such as moved more cash into the u.s. from our international operations, pursued collections on receivables from our customers and partners and renegotiated longer payment terms on vendor payables.  we also slowed down our acquisition program in the second and third quarters of 2020.  we believe we have sufficient liquidity on hand to continue business operations during this uncertain period.  if we experience a significant reduction in revenue in the future, we have additional alternatives to maintain liquidity, including use of common stock to fund future acquisitions.
cash flows from operating activities historically, we have depended on our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations to meet a substantial portion of our cash requirements.  we believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will provide us with adequate resources to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future.  to fund acquisitions made during 2020, 2019 and 2018, we relied on a combination of net cash flows from operations, proceeds from borrowings under our credit agreement, proceeds from issuances of senior unsecured notes and issuances of our common stock.
cash provided by operating activities was $1,752.5 million, $1,119.2 million and $765.1 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  the increase in cash provided by operating activities during 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to timing differences between periods in the collection of other current receivables and payments on current liabilities.  during 2020, we managed our working capital in terms of receivables and payables as a cautionary step to protect liquidity during this uncertain period.  in addition, during 2020, the company filed a refund claim under a cares act provision that accelerates the ability of companies to recover amt credits and we received a $28.5 million refund related to our amt credit carryovers, which was the remaining amount owed to us.  under the cares act we also elected to defer the payment of $51.6 million of employer payroll tax obligations incurred in 2020 into 2021 and 2022.  this also defers our income tax deduction related to these employer payroll taxes,
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to the following items: decreases in 2019 compared to 2018 of $48.0 million of payments on acquisition earnouts in excess of original estimates, $45.9 million of income tax payments and $30.0 million discretionary contribution made to our defined benefit plan in 2018.  also contributing to the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018 were timing differences between years in the collection of receivables and direct bill revenues, and the payment of accrued liabilities.
in addition, cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was favorably impacted by timing differences in the receipts and disbursements of client fiduciary related balances in 2020 compared to 2019.  the following table summarizes two lines from our consolidated statement of cash flows and provides information that management believes is helpful when comparing changes in client fiduciary related balances for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):
net change in premiums payable to underwriting enterprises             1,154.2               461.6               819.7
our cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from our earnings from operations, as adjusted, for our non-cash expenses, which include depreciation, amortization, change in estimated acquisition earnout payables, deferred compensation, restricted stock, and stock-based and other non-cash compensation expenses.  cash provided by operating activities can be unfavorably impacted if the amount of irc section 45 tax credits generated (which is the amount we recognize for financial reporting purposes) is greater than the amount of tax credits actually used to reduce our tax cash obligations.  excess tax credits produced during the period result in an increase to our deferred tax assets, which is a net use of cash related to operating activities. please see "clean energy investments" below for more information on their potential future impact on cash provided by operating activities.
when assessing our overall liquidity, we believe that the focus should be on net earnings as reported in our consolidated statement of earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (i.e., ebitdac), and cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.  consolidated ebitdac was $1,596.8 million, $1,295.6 million and $1,046.4 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  net earnings attributable to controlling interests were $818.8 million, $668.8 million and $633.5 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  we believe that ebitdac items are indicators of trends in liquidity.  from a balance sheet perspective, we believe the focus should not be on premium and fees receivable, premiums payable or restricted cash for trends in liquidity.  net cash flows provided by operations will vary substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year because of the variability in the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable.  we believe that in order to consider these items in assessing our trends in liquidity, they should be looked at in a combined manner, because changes in these balances are interrelated and are based on the timing of premium payments, both to and from us.  in addition, funds legally restricted as to our use relating to premiums and clients' claim funds held by us in a fiduciary capacity are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as "restricted cash" and have not been included in determining our overall liquidity.
our policy for funding our defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the irc.  the employee retirement security act of 1974, as amended (which we refer to as erisa), could impose a minimum funding requirement for our plan.  we were not required to make any minimum contributions to the plan for the 2020, 2019 and 2018 plan years.  funding requirements are based on the plan being frozen and the aggregate amount of our historical funding.  the plan's actuaries determine contribution rates based on our funding practices and requirements.  funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance, the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and/or liabilities of the plan.  in addition, amounts funded in the future, to the extent not due under regulatory requirements, may be affected by alternative uses of our cash flows, including dividends, acquisitions and common stock repurchases.  during 2018 we made a $30.0 million discretionary contribution to the plan in order to minimize the potential impact of having to make required minimum contributions to the plan in future periods. during 2020 and 2019 we did not make discretionary contributions to the plan.
see note 13 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements for additional information required to be disclosed relating to our defined benefit postretirement plans.  we are required to recognize an accrued benefit plan liability for our underfunded defined benefit pension and unfunded retiree medical plans (which we refer to together as the plans).  the offsetting adjustment to the liabilities required to be recognized for the plans is recorded in "accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss)," net of tax, in our consolidated balance sheet.  we will recognize subsequent changes in the funded status of the plans through the income statement and as a component of comprehensive earnings, as appropriate, in the year in which they occur.  numerous items may lead to a change in
in 2020, the funded status of the plan was unfavorably impacted by a decrease in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31, 2020, the net impact of which was approximately $15.0 million.  however, the funded status was favorably impacted by returns on the plan's assets being higher in 2020 than anticipated by approximately $17.9 million.  the net change in the funded status of the plan in 2020 resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities in 2020 of $2.9 million.  in 2019, the funded status of the plan was unfavorably impacted by a decrease in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december 31, 2019, the net impact of which was approximately $21.3 million.  however, the funded status was favorably impacted by returns on the plan's assets being higher in 2019 than anticipated by approximately $23.8 million.  the net change in the funded status of the plan in 2019 resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities in 2019 of $2.5 million.  while the change in funded status of the plan had no direct impact on our cash flows from operations in 2020, 2019 and 2018, potential changes in the pension regulatory environment and investment losses in our pension plan have an effect on our capital position and could require us to make significant contributions to our defined benefit pension plan and increase our pension expense in future periods.
cash flows from investing activities capital expenditures - capital expenditures were $99.3 million, $138.8 million and $124.4 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  in addition, 2020 and 2019 capital expenditures include amounts incurred related to investments made in information technology and software development projects.  relating to the development of our new corporate headquarters, we received property tax related credits under a tax-increment financing note from rolling meadows, illinois and an illinois state edge tax credit.  incentives from these two programs could total between $60.0 million and $90.0 million over a fifteen-year period.  in 2021, we expect total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately $150.0 million, part of which is related to expenditures on office moves and expansions and updating computer systems and equipment.
acquisitions - cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, was $324.3 million, $1,266.8 million and $784.8 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the decreased use of cash for acquisitions in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in the number and size of acquisitions in 2020 than occurred in 2019. the increased use of cash for acquisitions in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the number and size of acquisitions in 2019 than occurred in 2018.  in addition, during 2020, 2019 and 2018 we issued 3.0 million shares ($306.1 million), 1.9 million shares ($166.1 million) and 0.8 million shares ($60.8 million), respectively, of our common stock as payment for a portion of the total consideration paid for acquisitions and earnout payments.  we completed 27, 49 and 48 acquisitions in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  annualized revenues of businesses acquired in 2020, 2019 and 2018 totaled approximately $251.4 million, $468.2 million and $339.8 million, respectively.  in 2021, we expect to use new debt, our credit agreement, cash from operations and our common stock to fund all, or a portion of acquisitions we complete.
we significantly reduced our acquisition activity in the second and third quarters of 2020 because of the economic uncertainty brought on by covid-19, and if liquidity concerns arise, we could use common stock to fund future acquisitions.
dispositions - during 2020, 2019 and 2018, we sold several books of business and recognized one-time (losses) gains of $(5.8) million of losses and $75.3 million and $10.2 million of gains, respectively.  on december 16, 2020, we completed the sale of a u.k. wealth management business that we purchased over four years ago that no longer strategically fit in our benefits operations. in fourth quarter 2020, we recognized a net pretax non-cash loss on sale of approximately $12.0 million, primarily due to the write-off of the remaining net book value of the amortizable intangible assets.
on january 8, 2019, we sold a travel insurance brokerage operation that was initially purchased in 2014.  in first quarter 2019, we recognized a one-time, net gain of $0.17 of diluted net earnings per share as a result of the sale.
clean energy investments - during the period from 2009 through 2020, we have made significant investments in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualifies for tax credits under irc section 45. our current estimate of the 2021 annual net after-tax earnings, including irc section 45 tax credits, which will be produced from all of our clean energy investments in 2020, is $60.0 million to $75.0 million.  the irc section 45 tax credits generate positive cash flow by reducing the amount of federal income taxes we pay, which is offset by the operating expenses of the plants, by any capital expenditures related to the redeployment, and in some cases the relocation of refined coal plants.  we anticipate positive net cash flow related to irc section 45 activity in 2021.  however, there are several variables that can impact net cash flow from clean energy investments in any given year.  therefore, accurately predicting positive or negative cash flow in particular future periods is not possible at this time. nonetheless, if current ownership interests remain the same, if capital expenditures related to redeployment and relocation of refined
coal plants remain as currently anticipated, and if we continue to generate sufficient taxable income to use the tax credits produced by our irc section 45 investments, we anticipate that these investments will continue to generate positive net cash flows for the period 2021 through at least 2025.  while we cannot precisely forecast the cash flow impact in any particular period, we anticipate that the net cash flow impact of these investments will be positive overall.  please see "clean energy investments" on pages 48 and 49 for a more detailed description of these investments and their risks and uncertainties.
cash flows from financing activities on june 7, 2019, we entered into an amendment and restatement to our multicurrency credit agreement dated april 8, 2016 (which we refer to as the credit agreement) with a group of fifteen financial institutions.  the amendment and restatement, among other things, extended the expiration date of the credit agreement from april 8, 2021 to june 7, 2024 and increased the revolving credit commitment from $800.0 million to $1,200.0 million, of which $75.0 million may be used for issuances of standby or commercial letters of credit and up to $75.0 million may be used for the making of swing loans, (as defined in the credit agreement).  we may from time to time request, subject to certain conditions, an increase in the revolving credit commitment under the credit agreement up to a maximum aggregate revolving credit commitment of $1,700.0 million.  on august 27, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement providing that the obligations of each subsidiary of gallagher that was a borrower, guarantor and/or obligor under the credit agreement, ceased to apply and that each such subsidiary was released from all of its obligations under the credit agreement. the amendment also replaced the minimum asset covenant with a priority indebtedness covenant, substantially similar to other priority indebtedness covenants applicable to us under our private placement note purchase agreements.
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31, 2020.  due to the outstanding borrowing and letters of credit, $1,182.6 million remained available for potential borrowings under the credit agreement at december 31, 2020.
we use the credit agreement to post letters of credit and to borrow funds to supplement our operating cash flows from time to time. during 2020, we borrowed an aggregate of $2,630.0 million and repaid $3,150.0 million under our credit agreement.  during 2019, we borrowed an aggregate of $4,315.0 million and repaid $4,060.0 million under our credit agreement.  during 2018, we borrowed an aggregate of $3,075.0 million and repaid $3,000.0 million under our credit agreement.  principal uses of the 2020, 2019 and 2018 borrowings under the credit agreement were to fund acquisitions, earnout payments related to acquisitions and general corporate purposes.
on september 30, 2020, we entered into an amendment to our revolving loan facility (which we refer to as the premium financing debt facility) that provides funding for the three australian (au) and new zealand (nz) premium finance subsidiaries.  the amendment, among other things, extended the expiration date of the premium financing debt facility from july 18, 2021 to september 15, 2022, added six-months of variable limits to facility b nz$ beginning in 2021 and increased the total commitment for the au$ denominated tranche from au$245.0 million to au$310.0 million.  the premium financing debt facility is comprised of: (i) facility b is separated into au$260.0 million and nz$25.0 million tranches, (ii) facility c, an au$50.0 million equivalent multi‐currency overdraft tranche and (iii) facility d, a nz$15.0 million equivalent multi-currency overdraft tranche.
at december 31, 2020, we had $4,348.0 million of corporate-related borrowings outstanding under separate note purchase agreements entered into in the period 2009 to 2020, no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, $203.6 million outstanding under our premium financing debt facility and a cash and cash equivalent balance of $664.6 million.  see note 8 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the note purchase agreements, the credit agreement and the premium financing debt facility.
on january 30, 2020, we closed and funded an offering of $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate private placement unsecured senior notes. the weighted average maturity of these notes is 11.7 years and the weighted average interest rate is 4.23% per annum after giving effect to underwriting costs and the net hedge loss. in 2017 and 2018, we entered into pre-issuance interest rate hedging transactions related to this private placements.  we realized a net cash loss of approximately $8.9 million on the hedging transactions that will be recognized on a pro rata basis as an increase to our reported interest expense over ten years.
we used these offerings to repay certain existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, including to fund acquisitions.
consistent with past practice, as of december 31, 2020 we had pre-issuance hedges open for $350.0 million for 2021 and $200.0 million for 2022.
on february 13, 2019, we closed an offering of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate private placement senior unsecured notes.  this offering was funded on february 13, 2019 ($340.0 million) and march 13, 2019 ($260.0 million).  the weighted average maturity of these notes is 10.1 years and the weighted average interest rate is 5.04% after giving effect to a net hedging loss.  in 2017 and 2018, we entered into pre-issuance interest rate hedging transactions related to this private placement.  we realized a net cash loss of approximately $1.2 million on the hedging transactions that will be recognized on a pro rata basis as an increase in our reported interest expense over the life of the debt.

the note purchase agreements, the credit agreement and the premium financing debt facility contain various financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios.  we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31, 2020.
dividends - our board of directors determines our dividend policy.  our board of directors determines dividends on our common stock on a quarterly basis after considering our available cash from earnings, our anticipated cash needs and current conditions in the economy and financial markets.
in 2020, we declared $348.4 million in cash dividends on our common stock, or $1.80 per common share.  on december 18, 2020, we paid a fourth quarter dividend of $0.45 per common share to shareholders of record as of december 4, 2020.  on january 27, 2021, we announced a quarterly dividend for first quarter 2021 of $0.48 per common share.  if the dividend is maintained at $0.48 per common share throughout 2021, this dividend level would result in an annualized net cash used by financing activities in 2021 of
shelf registration statement - on november 15, 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement on form s-3 with the sec, registering the offer and sale from time to time, of an indeterminate amount of our common stock.  the availability of the potential liquidity under this shelf registration statement depends on investor demand, market conditions and other factors.  we make no assurances regarding when, or if, we will issue any shares under this registration statement.  on november 15, 2016, we also filed a shelf registration statement on form s-4 with the sec, registering 10.0 million shares of our common stock that we may offer and issue from time to time in connection with future acquisitions of other businesses, assets or securities.  at december 31, 2020, 4.3 million shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement.
common stock repurchases - we have in place a common stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors. during the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not repurchase shares of our common stock.  during the year ended december 31, 2018, we repurchased 0.1 million shares of our common stock at cost of $11.3 million. under the provisions of the repurchase plan, we are authorized to repurchase approximately 7.3 million additional shares at december 31, 2020.  the plan authorizes the repurchase of our common stock at such times and prices as we may deem advantageous, in transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  we are under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular number of shares, and the plan may be suspended at any time at our discretion.  funding for share repurchases may come from a variety of sources, including cash from operations, short-term or long-term borrowings under our credit agreement or other sources.
common stock issuances - another source of liquidity to us is the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans.  proceeds from the issuance of common stock under these plans were $111.9 million in 2020, $101.2 million in 2019 and $81.9 million in 2018.  on may 16, 2017, our stockholders approved the 2017 long-term incentive plan (which we refer to as the ltip), which replaced our previous stockholder-approved 2014 long-term incentive plan.  all of our officers, employees and non-employee directors are eligible to receive awards under the ltip.  awards which may be granted under the ltip include non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and performance units, any or all of which may be made contingent upon the achievement of performance criteria.  stock options with respect to 11.4 million shares (less any shares of restricted stock issued under the ltip - 2.3 million shares of our common stock were available for this purpose as of december 31, 2020) were available for grant under the ltip at december 31, 2020.  our employee stock purchase plan allows our employees to purchase our common stock at 95% of its fair market value.  proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to these plans have contributed favorably to net cash provided by financing activities in the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, and we believe this favorable trend will continue in the foreseeable future.
we have a qualified contributory savings and thrift 401(k) plan covering the majority of our domestic employees. for eligible employees who have met the plan's age and service requirements to receive matching contributions, we historically have matched 100% of pre-tax and roth elective deferrals up to a maximum of 5.0% of eligible compensation, subject to federal limits on plan contributions and not in excess of the maximum amount deductible for federal income tax purposes. beginning in 2021, the amount matched by the company will be discretionary and annually determined by management.  employees must be employed and eligible for the plan on the last day of the plan year to receive a matching contribution, subject to certain exceptions enumerated in the plan document. matching contributions are subject to a five-year graduated vesting schedule and can be funded in cash or company stock. we expensed (net of plan forfeitures) $63.6 million, $59.4 million and $53.9 million related to the plan in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. our board of directors has authorized the use of common stock to fund our 2020 employer matching contributions to the 401(k) plan, which we plan to do in february 2021.
outlook - we believe that we have sufficient capital and access to additional capital to meet our short- and long-term cash flow needs.
contractual obligations and commitments in connection with our investing and operating activities, we have entered into certain contractual obligations and commitments.  see notes 8, 14 and 17 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these obligations and commitments.  our future minimum cash payments, including interest, associated with our contractual obligations pursuant to our note purchase agreements and credit agreement, operating leases and purchase commitments as of december 31, 2020 are as follows (in millions):
credit agreement                                -                    -                    -                    -                    -                        -                       -
premium financing debt facility             203.6                    -                    -                    -                    -                        -                   203.6
the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements, because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation.  as of december 31, 2020, we had a $48.2 million accrued liability related to the ashton tiffany acquisition, that is not in the foregoing table, that may be settled using shares of our common stock in early february 2021.
in addition, due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2020, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period in which cash settlements may be made with the respective taxing authorities.  see note 19 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes.
see note 8 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the credit agreement and note purchase agreements.
off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet commitments - our total unrecorded commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit, financial guarantees and funding commitments as of december 31, 2020 are as follows (in millions):
amount of commitment expiration by period
off-balance sheet commitments   2021              2022              2023              2024              2025                     thereafter         total amounts committed letters of credit                        $-                $-                $-                $-                $-                   $18.4         $18.4

since commitments may expire unused, the amounts presented in the table above do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements.  see note 17 to our 2020 consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our funding commitments related to our corporate segment and the off-balance sheet debt section below for a discussion of other letters of credit.  all but one of the letters of credit represent multiple year commitments that have annual, automatic renewing provisions and are classified by the latest commitment date.
on december 23, 2020, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the equity of the bollington wilson group (which we refer to as bollington) headquartered in sale, greater manchester, u.k., for approximately $330.0 million of cash consideration.  the transaction is subject to regulatory approval, which we received on january 26, 2021, and is expected to close in february 2021.
since january 1, 2002, we have acquired 583 companies, all of which were accounted for using the acquisition method for recording business combinations.  substantially all of the purchase agreements related to these acquisitions contain provisions for potential earnout obligations.  for all of our acquisitions made in the period from 2016 to 2020 that contain potential earnout obligations, such obligations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the recorded purchase price
consideration for the respective acquisition.  the amounts recorded as earnout payables are primarily based upon estimated future operating results of the acquired entities over a two- to three-year period subsequent to the acquisition date.  the aggregate amount of the maximum earnout obligations related to these acquisitions was $1,128.1 million, of which $592.2 million was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2020, based on the estimated fair value of the expected future payments to be made, of which approximately $493.7 million can be settled in cash or stock at our option and $98.5 million must be settled in cash.
off-balance sheet debt - our unconsolidated investment portfolio includes investments in enterprises where our ownership interest is between 1% and 50%, in which management has determined that our level of influence and economic interest is not sufficient to require consolidation.  as a result, these investments are accounted for under the equity method.  none of these unconsolidated investments had any outstanding debt at december 31, 2020 and 2019 that was recourse to us.
at december 31, 2020, we had posted two letters of credit totaling $9.4 million, in the aggregate, related to our self-insurance deductibles, for which we have recorded a liability of $17.5 million.  we have an equity investment in a rent-a-captive facility, which we use as a placement facility for certain of our insurance brokerage operations.  at december 31, 2020, we had posted seven letters of credit totaling $7.5 million to allow certain of our captive operations to meet minimum statutory surplus requirements plus additional collateral related to premium and claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity, one letter of credit totaling $1.0 million for collateral related to claim funds held in a fiduciary capacity by a recent acquisition and one letter of credit totaling $0.5 million as a security deposit for a 2015 acquisition's lease.  these letters of credit have never been drawn upon.

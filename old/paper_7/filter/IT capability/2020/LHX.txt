item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
overview the following management's discussion and analysis ("md&a") is intended to assist in an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended january 1, 2021 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 and the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with two quarters ended december 28, 2018. for a discussion of our results for fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, see "item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" included in our transition report on form 10-kt for the fiscal transition period. this md&a is provided as a supplement to, should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report. except for the historical information contained herein, the discussions in this md&a contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our future results could differ materially from those discussed herein. factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below in this md&a under "forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results."
the following is a list of the sections of this md&a, together with our perspective on their contents, which we hope will assist in reading these pages:
•business considerations - a general description of our business; the value drivers of our business; fiscal 2020 results of operations and liquidity and capital resources key indicators; and industry-wide opportunities, challenges and risks that are relevant to us in defense, government and commercial markets.
•operations review - an analysis of our consolidated results of operations and of the results in each of our business segments, to the extent the segment operating results are helpful to an understanding of our business as a whole, for the periods presented in our financial statements.
•liquidity, capital resources and financial strategies - an analysis of cash flows, funding of pension plans, common stock repurchases, dividends, capital structure and resources, contractual obligations, off-balance sheet arrangements, commercial commitments, financial risk management, impact of foreign exchange and impact of inflation.
•critical accounting policies and estimates - a discussion of accounting policies and estimates that require the most judgment and a discussion of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented by us and their potential impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.
•forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results - cautionary information about forward-looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or our current expectations or projections.
covid the ongoing covid pandemic and attempts to contain and reduce the spread of the virus, such as mandatory closures, "shelter-in-place" orders and travel and quarantine restrictions, have caused significant disruptions and adverse effects on the u.s. and global economies, such as impacts to supply chains, customer demand, international trade and capital markets. our response has involved increasing our focus on keeping our employees safe while striving to maintain continuity of operations, meet customer commitments and support suppliers. for example, we instituted work-from-home (for employees who are able to work remotely) and social distancing arrangements; canceled travel and external events; procured personal protective equipment for employees; implemented health screening procedures at all facilities; staggered work shifts, redesigned work stations, implemented stringent cleaning protocols and initiated more detailed safety precautions and protocols for on-site work, such as daily health assessments and mandatory face coverings, which currently remain in effect. we have also maintained an active dialog with key suppliers and developed plans to mitigate supply chain risks. we have allowed certain essential business travel to resume, and we continue to expect to utilize a phased approach based on local conditions for transitioning employees from work-from-home arrangements to on-site work. the u.s. government response to covid has included identifying the defense industrial base as a critical infrastructure sector and enhancing cash flow and liquidity for the defense industrial base, such as by increasing progress payments and accelerating contract awards. as a part of the defense industrial base, these actions have enabled us to keep our u.s. production facilities largely operational in support of national security commitments to u.s. government customers and to accelerate payments to small business suppliers, which we expect to continue while the u.s. government's responsive actions remain in effect.
although we believe that the large percentage of our revenue, earnings and cash flow that is derived from sales to the u.s. government, whether directly or through prime contractors, will be relatively predictable, in part due to the responsive actions taken by the u.s. government described above, our commercial, international and public safety businesses are at a higher risk of adverse impacts related to covid. for example, the severe decline in global air traffic from travel restrictions and the resulting downturn in the commercial aviation market and its impact on customer operations has significantly reduced demand for flight training, flight simulators and commercial avionics products in our aviation systems segment. as a result, we temporarily, and in some circumstances permanently, closed or will soon close some of our flight training facilities, initiated restructuring and other actions to align our resources with the outlook for the commercial aviation market (including workforce reduction and facility consolidation) and have recognized $767 million of charges for impairment of goodwill and other assets and other covid-related impacts in fiscal 2020.
the extent of these disruptions and impacts, including on our ability to perform under u.s. government contracts and other contracts within agreed timeframes and ultimately on our results of operations and cash flows, will depend on future developments, including the severity and duration of the pandemic and associated containment and mitigation actions taken by the u.s. government, state and local government officials and international governments, and consequences thereof, and global air traffic demand and governmental subsidies to airlines, all of which are uncertain and unpredictable.
the impact of covid may also exacerbate other risks discussed in part i, "item 1a. risk factors" in this report, any of which could have a material effect on us. we continue to work with our customers, employees, suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers and communities to address the impact of the pandemic. we continue to assess possible implications to our business, supply chain and customers, and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences. for further information regarding the impact, and the risks of the impact, of covid on the company, see part i, "item 1a. risk factors" in this report.
business considerations general we generate revenue, income and cash flows by developing, manufacturing or providing, and selling advanced, technology-based solutions that meet government and commercial customers' mission-critical needs. we support government and commercial customers in more than 100 countries, with our largest customers being various departments and agencies of the u.s. government and their prime contractors. our products, systems and services have defense and civil government applications, as well as commercial applications. as of january 1, 2021, we had approximately 48,000 employees, including approximately 19,000 engineers and scientists. we generally sell directly to our customers, and we utilize agents and intermediaries to sell and market some products and services, especially in international markets.
we structure our operations primarily around the products, systems and services we sell and the markets we serve, and we report the financial results of our continuing operations in the following four reportable segments, which are also referred to as our business segments:
•integrated mission systems, including multi-mission isr and communication systems; integrated electrical and electronic systems for maritime platforms; and advanced eo/ir solutions;
•space and airborne systems, including space payloads, sensors and full-mission solutions; classified intelligence and cyber defense; mission avionics; and electronic warfare;
•communication systems, including tactical communications; broadband communications; integrated vision solutions; and public safety; and
•aviation systems, including defense aviation; commercial aviation products; commercial and military pilot training; and mission networks for air traffic management.
during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we adjusted our segment reporting to better align our businesses and transferred two businesses between our integrated mission systems and space and airborne systems segments. the historical results, discussion and presentation of our business segments as set forth in this md&a reflect the impact of these changes for all periods presented in order to present segment information on a comparable basis. there is no impact on our previously reported consolidated statements of income, balance sheets, statements of cash flows or statements of equity resulting from these changes.

see note 25: business segments in the notes for further information regarding our business segments, including how we define segment operating income or loss.
as discussed in further detail in note 4: restructuring and other exit costs and note 5: business combination in the notes, we recorded the following charges at our corporate headquarters in connection with the l3harris merger.
(in millions)                                                                       as reported                          as reported (unaudited)                        pro forma                                                             as reported equity award acceleration charges, recognized upon change in control                $-                                             $70                                  $70                              $70                                   $-

because the l3harris merger benefited the entire company as opposed to any individual business segment, the above costs were not allocated to any business segment. most of the costs above were recorded in the "engineering, selling and administrative expenses" line item in our consolidated statement of income, except for additional cost of sales related to the fair value step-up in inventory sold, which is included in the "cost of product sales and services" line item in our consolidated statement of income and facility consolidation costs, the majority of which is included in the "impairment of goodwill and other assets" line item in our consolidated statement of income.
as described in more detail in note 1: significant accounting policies in the notes, effective june 29, 2019, we changed our fiscal year end to the friday nearest december 31, and the period that commenced on june 29, 2019 was a fiscal transition period that ended on january 3, 2020. references herein to the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 and two quarters ended december 28, 2018 represent the unaudited prior year results for the comparative periods ended january 3, 2020 and december 28, 2018.
value drivers of our business during fiscal 2020, we made progress executing our strategy of building a technology-focused operating company and becoming a full end-to-end mission solutions prime contractor to drive shareholder value. despite impacts from covid to our commercial aviation and public safety businesses, we met customer commitments, delivered organic revenue growth in our core u.s. government and international businesses on a pro forma (as defined below in this md&a) basis, advanced the integration and made progress on portfolio shaping, while increasing our focus on keeping our employees safe.
we received several key strategic contract awards in fiscal 2020, establishing us as a mission solutions prime contractor with our responsive satellites and unmanned surface vehicles and within missile defense, as well as highlighting our technology and solutions for the contested environments our customers will need to compete and operate in in the future. we also invested $684 million (4 percent of total revenue) in company-sponsored r&d focused on technologies that expand our capabilities in the following areas:
•open systems architecture;
•multi-function system capabilities; and
•software-defined solutions.
we also made progress during the fiscal year reshaping our portfolio to focus on technology-differentiated businesses, completing three divestitures, and used the proceeds along with our net cash provided by operating activities to repurchase shares of our common stock. in addition, we refinanced debt and expanded our future financial flexibility.
we plan to build on our fiscal 2020 momentum, and together with broad programs support across key areas in the dod budget, expected international growth and l3harris merger synergies and a continued focus on operational excellence and innovation, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our strategic priorities for fiscal 2021 and thereafter, which include the following:
•growing revenue through investments in r&d in high growth, high margin areas where technology is a key differentiator to address our customers' most critical challenges;
•executing seamless integration and achieving at least $320 million to $350 million in net cost synergies from the l3harris merger by the end of 2021;
•driving flawless execution and margin expansion through our e3 (excellence, everywhere, every day) operational excellence program;
•reshaping our business portfolio to focus on high margin, high growth businesses; and
•maximizing cash flow with shareholder friendly capital deployment.
during fiscal 2020, we returned to our shareholders $725 million through dividends and $2,290 million through share repurchases. on january 28, 2021, we announced that our board of directors approved a 20 percent increase in the quarterly per share cash dividend rate on our common stock to $1.02, commencing with the dividend to be declared for the first quarter of 2021, for an annualized per share rate of $4.08, as well as a new $6 billion share repurchase authorization under our repurchase program that was in addition to the remaining unused authorization of $210 million, for a total unused authorization of $6.2 billion. in fiscal 2021, we believe revenue growth across our business segments and margin expansion will improve our operating cash flow, which we expect to use for investments in technology and innovation, dividends and share repurchases.
beyond fiscal 2020, we expect three main building blocks will support growth over the next three to five years, although we can give no assurances on this subject. first, we have a portfolio that is well aligned with national security priorities for threats identified in the national defense strategy. we have realigned our r&d efforts to extend our position through investments in open architecture, multi-function software-defined technologies and we anticipate future defense budgets will continue to prioritize spending in the areas in which we are currently well-positioned and investing in technology. second, we uniquely benefit from the revenue synergy opportunities created by the l3harris merger expanding our addressable market. third, we expect to leverage our sales channels and capitalize on our strengths domestically to support global modernization efforts and drive growth in international revenue.
key indicators we believe our value drivers, when implemented, will improve our financial results, including: revenue; income from continuing operations and income from continuing operations per diluted common share; income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue; total backlog; net cash provided by operating activities; return on invested capital (defined as after-tax operating income from continuing operations divided by the two-point average of invested capital at the beginning and end of the period, where invested capital equals equity plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents); return on average equity (defined as income from continuing operations divided by the two-point average of equity at the beginning and end of the fiscal period); and consolidated total indebtedness to total capital ratio. the measure of our success is reflected in our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources key indicators as discussed below.
because of the l3harris merger, fiscal 2020 reflects the results of the combined company, while the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 reflect the results of only harris operating businesses for the two quarters ended june 28, 2019 and the results of the combined company for the two quarters ended january 3, 2020. due to the significance of the l3 operating businesses included in the combined company results following the l3harris merger, the reported results for fiscal 2020 and four quarters ended january 3, 2020 generally are not comparable. therefore, to assist with a discussion of the consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2020 and four quarters ended january 3, 2020 on a more comparable basis, certain supplemental unaudited pro forma combined income statement information prepared in accordance with the requirements of article 11 of regulation s-x (referred to in this md&a as "pro forma") also is provided (see "supplemental unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statement information" below in this md&a).
fiscal 2020 results of operations key indicators: revenue, income from continuing operations, income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue, income from continuing operations per diluted common share and total backlog represent key measurements of our value drivers:
•revenue increased 42 percent to $18.2 billion in fiscal 2020 from $12.9 billion in the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 primarily due to the inclusion of $5.5 billion of revenue (net of intercompany sales eliminations) from l3 operations in operating results for the two quarters ended july 3, 2020 (but not for the comparable prior-year two quarters preceding the l3harris merger);
•income from continuing operations attributable to l3harris common shareholders decreased 16 percent to $1,121 million in fiscal 2020 from $1,335 million in the four quarters ended january 3, 2020, primarily due to the combined effects of the reasons discussed below on an as reported basis, particularly the non-cash charges for impairment of goodwill and other assets associated with the covid-related downturn in the commercial aviation market and its impact on customer operations in fiscal 2020;
•income from continuing operations per diluted common share attributable to l3harris common shareholders decreased 34 percent to $5.19 in fiscal 2020 from $7.90 in the four quarters ended january 3, 2020, reflecting the decrease in income from continuing operations as noted above and higher weighted average diluted common shares outstanding due to 104 million shares issued in connection with the l3harris merger on june 29, 2019, partially offset by share repurchases during fiscal 2020; and
•total backlog increased 5 percent to $21.7 billion at january 1, 2021 from $20.6 billion at january 3, 2020. backlog at january 3, 2020 included $405 million associated with businesses divested in fiscal 2020, including $380 million of backlog associated with the airport security and automation business divested during the quarter ended july 3, 2020.
consolidated - pro forma
•revenue increased 1 percent to $18.2 billion in fiscal 2020 from $18.1 billion in the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 primarily due to growth in core u.s. and international businesses, mostly offset by divestitures and covid-related impacts to our commercial aviation and public safety businesses;
•income from continuing operations attributable to l3harris common shareholders decreased 31 percent to $1,121 million in fiscal 2020 from $1,628 million in the four quarters ended january 3, 2020, primarily due to the combined effects of the reasons discussed below on a pro forma basis, particularly the non-cash charges for impairment of goodwill and other assets associated with the covid-related downturn in the commercial aviation market and its impact on customer operations in fiscal 2020;
•total backlog increased 5 percent to $21.7 billion at january 1, 2021 from $20.6 billion at january 3, 2020. backlog at january 3, 2020 included $405 million associated with businesses divested in fiscal 2020, including $380 million of backlog associated with the airport security and automation business divested during the quarter ended july 3, 2020.
refer to md&a heading "operations review" below in this report for more information.
fiscal 2020 liquidity and capital resources key indicators: net cash provided by operating activities, return on invested capital, return on average equity and our consolidated total indebtedness to total capital ratio also represent key measurements of our value drivers:
•net cash provided by operating activities increased to $2,790 million in fiscal 2020 from $1,655 million in the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 reflecting the inclusion of cash flows from l3 operations following the l3harris merger;
•return on invested capital decreased to 4 percent in fiscal 2020 from 7 percent in the four quarters ended january 3, 2020;
•return on average equity decreased to 5 percent in fiscal 2020 from 10 percent in the four quarters ended january 3, 2020; and
•our consolidated total indebtedness to total capital ratio at january 1, 2021 was 25 percent, compared with our 65 percent covenant limitation under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
refer to md&a heading "liquidity, capital resources and financial strategies" below in this report for more information on net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities.
we also measure the success of our business using certain measures that are not defined by gaap, such as adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow, which may be calculated differently by other companies. we use these measures, along with our key indicators above, to assess the success of our business and our ability to create shareholder value. we also use some of these and other performance metrics for executive compensation purposes.
industry-wide opportunities, challenges and risks department of defense and other u.s. federal markets: our largest customers are various departments and agencies of the u.s. government - the percentage of our revenue that was derived from sales to u.s. government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the u.s. government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was 78 percent, 73 percent, 77 percent and 75 percent in fiscal 2020, the two quarters ended january 3, 2020, and fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.
defense spending has been constrained by discretionary spending caps since the 2011 budget control act. to appropriate funding exceeding the caps, congress has passed a series of two-year budget deals to raise the caps on both discretionary defense and non-defense spending. the latest two-year agreement was signed into law on august 2, 2019 by the president. the bipartisan budget act of 2019 ("bba 2019") raised the discretionary defense caps for government fiscal year ("gfy") 2020 and gfy 2021 to $738 billion ($667 billion in defense base funding and $71 billion for overseas contingency operations ("oco") funding) and $741 billion ($672 billion in defense base funding and $69 billion for oco funding), respectively (u.s. government fiscal years begin october 1 and end september 30). this represented a 3% increase from gfy 2019 funding levels and builds on sustained funding increases congress also provided in gfy 2017 and gfy 2018. the bba 2019 also temporarily suspended the statutory debt ceiling through july 31, 2021.
on december 27, 2020, the president signed into law h.r.133, the consolidated appropriations act, 2021. this bill appropriates $635 billion in total dod base funding and $69 billion in oco funding. it also appropriates $28 billion for the department of energy national security mission and $9 billion for other defense related activities, in line with the budget request and consistent with the total national defense budget cap of $741 billion for gfy 2021 established in bba 2019. in 2020 there were several covid-related measures passed by congress and enacted into law, totaling approximately $3.5 trillion in funding. we expect congress and the new administration to consider additional covid legislation in early 2021, which could drive increased scrutiny of discretionary spending. however, although we anticipate debate will continue within the u.s. government over defense spending for future years (which may have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and on our specific programs), our programs have been well supported in recent years, and our major efforts are aligned to key dod needs.
government oversight and risk: as a u.s. government contractor, we are subject to u.s. government oversight. the u.s. government may investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations. depending on the results of those investigations and audits, the u.s. government could make claims against us. under u.s. government procurement regulations and practices, an indictment or conviction of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and/or suspended from being able to bid on, or from being awarded, new u.s. government contracts for a period of time determined by the u.s. government. similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business.
for a discussion of risks relating to u.s. government contracts and subcontracts, see "item 1. business - principal customers; government contracts" and "item 1a. risk factors" of this report. we are also subject to other risks associated with u.s. government business, including technological uncertainties, dependence on annual appropriations and allotment of funds, extensive regulations and other risks, which are discussed in "item 1a. risk factors" and "item 3. legal proceedings" of this report.
state and local: we also provide products to state and local government agencies that are committed to protecting our homeland and public safety. the public safety market was highly competitive and dependent on state and local government budgets during fiscal 2020. fiscal 2020 revenue in our public safety business sector was adversely impacted by covid-related pressures on state and local government customers and we expect a continued decrease in public safety revenue in early fiscal
2021. future market opportunities include upgrading aging analog infrastructure to new digital standards, as well as opportunities associated with next-generation long term evolution ("lte") solutions for high data-rate applications.

revenue fiscal year ended january 1, 2021 compared with four quarters ended january 3, 2020: the increase in revenue in fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 was primarily due to the inclusion of $5.5 billion of revenue (net of intercompany sales eliminations) from l3 operations in operating results for the two quarters ended july 3, 2020 (but not for the comparable prior-year two quarters preceding the l3harris merger) and organic revenue growth in our space and airborne systems, integrated mission systems and communication systems, partially offset by the impact of divestitures and the covid-related downturn in the commercial aviation market and its impact on customer operations in fiscal 2020.
two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with two quarters ended december 28, 2018: the increase in revenue in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended december 28, 2018 was primarily due to the inclusion of $5.7 billion of revenue (net of intercompany sales eliminations) from l3 operations in operating results for the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 and organic revenue growth in all four segments.

gross margin fiscal year ended january 1, 2021 compared with four quarters ended january 3, 2020: gross margin increased in fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 primarily due to the inclusion of l3 operations in operating results for the two quarters ended july 3, 2020 (but not for the comparable prior-year two quarters preceding the l3harris merger). gross margin as a percentage of revenue ("gross margin percentage") for fiscal 2020 was comparable with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 reflecting integration benefits and operational excellence, and $111 million of lower cost of sales related to the fair value step-up in inventory sold, offset by a mix of program revenue and product sales with relatively lower gross margin percentage and $37 million of higher amortization of identifiable intangible assets acquired as a result of the l3harris merger.
two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with two quarters ended december 28, 2018: gross margin increased in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended december 28, 2018 primarily due to the inclusion of l3 operations in operating results for the two quarters ended january 3, 2020. the decrease in gross margin percentage for the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended december 28, 2018 was primarily due to a mix of program revenue and product sales with relatively lower gross margin, $142 million of additional cost of sales related to the fair value step-up in inventory sold and $42 million of amortization of identifiable intangible assets acquired as a result of the l3harris merger in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020.

engineering, selling and administrative expenses fiscal year ended january 1, 2021 compared with four quarters ended january 3, 2020: the increase in engineering, selling and administrative ("esa") expenses in fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 was primarily due to the inclusion of l3 operations in operating results (but not for the comparable prior-year two quarters preceding the l3harris merger), $333 million of higher amortization of identifiable intangible assets acquired as a result of the l3harris merger, $16 million of covid-related restructuring expenses and other costs and $13 million of higher divestiture-related expenses, partially offset by $254 million of lower l3harris merger-related transaction, integration and restructuring expenses and a $22 million gain on sale of property, plant and equipment.
the decrease in esa expenses as a percentage of revenue ("esa percentage") in fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 was primarily driven by cost management, operational excellence, integration benefits, as well as lower l3harris merger-related transaction, integration and restructuring expenses and a gain on sale of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by higher amortization of identifiable intangible assets acquired as a result of the l3harris merger, covid-related restructuring expenses and other items, and divestiture-related expenses, as discussed above.
overall company-sponsored r&d costs were $684 million in fiscal 2020 compared with $504 million in the four quarters ended january 3, 2020.
two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with two quarters ended december 28, 2018: the increase in esa expenses and esa percentage in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended december 28, 2018 was primarily due to the inclusion of l3 operations in operating results, as well as $344 million of l3harris merger-related transaction, integration and restructuring expenses and $197 million of amortization of identifiable intangible assets acquired as a result of the l3harris merger in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020. esa expenses for the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 also included a $12 million gain on sale of a product line, offset by a $10 million non-cash cumulative adjustment to lease expense.
overall company-sponsored r&d costs were $329 million in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with $144 million in the two quarters ended december 28, 2018.

business divestiture-related (losses) gains fiscal year ended january 1, 2021 compared with four quarters ended january 3, 2020: business divestiture-related (losses) gains for fiscal 2020 included a $23 million pre-tax loss on the sale of the airport security and automation business divestiture, an $18 million non-cash remeasurement loss on a potential divestiture, a $12 million non-cash adjustment to the gain on the sale of the harris night vision business, partially offset by a $2 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the eotech business. the business divestiture-related gain for the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 was a $229 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the harris night vision business.
two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with two quarters ended december 28, 2018: the business divestiture-related gain for the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 was the same item as noted above for the four quarters ended january 3, 2020.

impairment of goodwill and other assets fiscal year ended january 1, 2021 compared with four quarters ended january 3, 2020: impairment of goodwill and other assets for fiscal 2020 reflects $748 million of non-cash charges for the impairment of goodwill and other assets associated with the covid-related downturn in the commercial aviation market and its impact on customer operations, a $14 million non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill recorded in the quarter ended july 3, 2020 in connection with a potential divestiture and a $5 million non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill recorded in the quarter ended april 3, 2020 in connection with the then-pending divestiture of our applied kilovolts and analytical instrumentation business.
two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with two quarters ended december 28, 2018: impairment of goodwill and other assets for the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 reflects a $46 million impairment of right-of-use assets associated with l3harris merger-related facilities consolidation.

non-operating income fiscal year ended january 1, 2021 compared with four quarters ended january 3, 2020: the increase in non-operating income in fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the non-service cost components of pension and other postretirement benefit plan income, reflecting the inclusion of income from benefit plans assumed in connection with the l3harris merger.
two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with two quarters ended december 28, 2018: the increase in non-operating income in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended december 28, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the non-service cost components of pension and other postretirement benefit plan income, including a $23 million gain on a pension plan curtailment, reflecting the inclusion in pension and other postretirement benefit plan income of benefit plans assumed in connection with the l3harris merger.

pro forma basis discussion for fiscal year ended january 1, 2021 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020
revenue fiscal year ended january 1, 2021 compared with four quarters ended january 3, 2020: the increase in revenue for fiscal 2020 compared with pro forma revenue for the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 was primarily due to growth in core u.s. and international businesses, excluding commercial aviation and public safety markets, which more than offset the covid-related decline. revenue growth was driven by $257 million of higher revenue in our space and airborne systems segment, $178 million of higher revenue in our integrated mission systems segment and $165 million of higher revenue in our communication systems segment, partially offset by a decline in our aviation systems segment, due to the divestiture of the airport security and automation business and covid-related impacts.
two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with two quarters ended december 28, 2018: the increase in revenue for the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with pro forma revenue for the two quarters ended december 28, 2018 was primarily due to $321 million higher revenue in our space and airborne systems segment, from a ramp in modernization of the f-35 platform in mission avionics, increased production of electronic warfare systems for f/a-18 and b-52 aircraft in electronic warfare and growth in ground-based adjacencies and exquisite systems in classified areas; $257 million higher revenue in our integrated mission systems segment, driven by growth in all three business sectors: isr, electro optical and maritime; $202 million higher revenue in our communication systems segment, from a ramp in dod modernization programs in tactical communications and integrated vision solutions as well as increased demand with state and federal customers in public safety; and higher revenue in our aviation systems segment, reflecting organic growth from precision engagement sensors and systems, partially offset by the prior period competitive loss of the usaf c-17 training contract.
gross margin fiscal year ended january 1, 2021 compared with four quarters ended january 3, 2020: the increase in gross margin and comparability of gross margin percentage for fiscal 2020 compared with pro forma gross margin and gross margin percentage for the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 reflects integration benefits, higher volume, operational excellence and $111 million of lower cost of sales related to the fair value step-up in inventory sold in the l3harris merger, partially offset by a mix of program revenue and product sales with relatively lower gross margin percentage in fiscal 2020.
two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with two quarters ended december 28, 2018: the increase in gross margin and decrease in gross margin percentage for the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with pro forma gross margin and gross margin percentage for the two quarters ended december 28, 2018 were primarily due to higher volume and strong operational performance, partially offset by $142 million of additional cost of sales related to the fair value step-up in inventory sold in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020.

two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with two quarters ended december 28, 2018: the increases in esa expenses and esa percentage for the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with pro forma esa expenses and esa percentage for the two quarters ended december 28, 2018 were primarily due to $344 million of l3harris merger-related transaction, integration and restructuring expenses in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020, partially offset by integration savings.

*not meaningful as reported fiscal year ended january 1, 2021 compared with four quarters ended january 3, 2020:  the increases in segment revenue, operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue ("operating margin percentage") in fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 were primarily due to the inclusion of l3 operations in segment operating results for the two quarters ended july 3, 2020 (but not for the comparable prior-year two quarters preceding the l3harris merger). because the integrated mission systems segment is almost entirely comprised of l3 businesses, comparison to the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 segment operating metrics is not meaningful. the funded backlog for this segment was $6.3 billion at january 1, 2021 compared with $5.3 billion at january 3, 2020.
the percentage of this segment's revenue that was derived from sales to u.s. government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the u.s. government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was 77 percent in fiscal 2020.
two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with two quarters ended december 28, 2018: the changes in segment revenue, operating income and operating margin percentage in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended december 28, 2018 were primarily due to the inclusion of l3 operations in segment operating results as a result of the l3harris merger during the two quarters ended january 3, 2020. because the integrated mission systems segment is almost entirely comprised of l3 businesses, comparison to prior year segment operating metrics is not meaningful. in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020, segment revenue also benefited from $213 million of revenue growth in isr and growth in electro optical. the funded backlog for this segment was $5.3 billion at january 3, 2020 compared with $5.4 billion at the beginning of the fiscal transition period (primarily from backlog acquired on june 29, 2019 in connection with the l3harris merger).
the percentage of this segment's revenue that was derived from sales to u.s. government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the u.s. government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was 75 percent in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020.
pro forma fiscal year ended january 1, 2021 compared with four quarters ended january 3, 2020: the increase in segment revenue in fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 was primarily due to $163 million of higher revenue in maritime from a ramp in manned and classified platforms and $31 million of higher revenue in isr.
the increases in segment operating income and operating margin percentage in fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 were primarily driven by operational excellence and integration benefits.

as reported fiscal year ended january 1, 2021 compared with four quarters ended january 3, 2020: the increases in segment revenue and operating income in fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 were primarily due to the inclusion of l3 operations in segment operating results for the two quarters ended july 3, 2020 (but not for the comparable prior-year two quarters preceding the l3harris merger), as well as organic growth in mission avionics and intel and cyber as discussed further below in the "pro forma" discussion for the fiscal year ended january 1, 2021 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020. the funded backlog for this segment was $3.8 billion at january 1, 2021 compared with $3.9 billion at january 3, 2020. segment operating margin percentage in fiscal 2020 was comparable with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020.
the percentage of this segment's revenue that was derived from sales to u.s. government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the u.s. government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was 90 percent in fiscal 2020.
two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with two quarters ended december 28, 2018: the increases in segment revenue and operating income in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended december 28, 2018 were primarily due to the inclusion of l3 operations in segment operating results as a result of the l3harris merger during the two quarters ended january 3, 2020, as well as higher revenue in mission avionics from growth on long-term platforms, $54 million higher revenue from growth in ground-based adjacencies and exquisite systems in classified areas and $58 million of higher revenue in electronic warfare from increased production of electronic warfare systems for f/a-18 and b-52 aircraft. the funded backlog for this segment was $3.9 billion at january 3, 2020 compared with $4.3 billion at the beginning of the fiscal transition period (including backlog acquired on june 29, 2019 in connection with the l3harris merger). segment operating margin percentage in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 was comparable with the two quarters ended december 28, 2018.
the percentage of this segment's revenue that was derived from sales to u.s. government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the u.s. government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was 88 percent in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with 89 percent in the two quarters ended december 28, 2018.
pro forma fiscal year ended january 1, 2021 compared with four quarters ended january 3, 2020: the increase in segment revenue in fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 was primarily due to $317 million of higher revenue in mission avionics, driven by a ramp on the f-35 platform, and $70 million of higher revenue in intel and cyber from growth on classified programs, partially offset by $107 million of lower revenue in space and lower revenue in electronic warfare, reflecting program transition timing.
the increase in segment operating income in fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 was primarily due to cost management, operational excellence and integration benefits, partially offset by program mix, including in respect of newly awarded fixed-priced development contracts. segment operating margin percentage for fiscal 2020 was comparable with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020.

as reported fiscal year ended january 1, 2021 compared with four quarters ended january 3, 2020: the increases in segment revenue and operating income, and decrease in segment operating margin percentage in fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 were primarily due to the inclusion of l3 operations in segment operating results for the two quarters ended july 3, 2020 (but not for the comparable prior-year two quarters preceding the l3harris merger), as well as organic growth in tactical communications, partially offset by lower revenue in public safety and the divestiture of the eotech business as discussed further below in the "pro forma" discussion for the fiscal year ended january 1, 2021 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020. the funded backlog for this segment was $3.3 billion at january 1, 2021 compared with $3.7 billion at january 3, 2020.
the percentage of this segment's revenue that was derived from sales to u.s. government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the u.s. government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was 69 percent in fiscal 2020.
two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with two quarters ended december 28, 2018: the increases in segment revenue and operating income in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended december 28, 2018 were primarily due to the inclusion of l3 operations in segment operating results as a result of the l3harris merger during the two quarters ended january 3, 2020, as well as $112 million of higher revenue in tactical communications from a ramp in dod modernization programs, $46 million of higher revenue in public safety, reflecting increased demand from state and federal customers, and $38 million of higher revenue in integrated vision solutions. the funded backlog for this segment was $3.7 billion at january 3, 2020 compared with $3.2 billion at the beginning of the fiscal transition period (including backlog acquired on june 29, 2019 in connection with the l3harris merger).
the decrease in segment operating margin percentage in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended december 28, 2018 was primarily due to a mix of program revenue and product sales with relatively lower operating margin percentage, partially offset by strong operational performance and integration savings.
the percentage of this segment's revenue that was derived from sales to u.s. government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the u.s. government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was 69 percent in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with 54 percent in the two quarters ended december 28, 2018.
pro forma fiscal year ended january 1, 2021 compared with four quarters ended january 3, 2020: the increase in revenue in fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 was primarily due to $268 million of higher tactical communications revenue (including global communications solutions), primarily due to a ramp in dod modernization programs that also benefited integrated vision solutions, partially offset by $84 million of lower revenue in public safety, reflecting covid-related pressures on state and local government municipality customers, and a $21 million revenue impact from the divestiture of the eotech business.
the increases in segment operating income and operating margin percentage in fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 were primarily due to operational excellence, integration benefits and cost management.
additional information on known trends and uncertainties revenue and operating income in our public safety business sector has been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely impacted by covid-related pressures on state and local government customers, including reduced staffing, limited remote work technology capabilities, significant reductions in near-term tax revenues and competing budget priorities. revenue in our public safety business sector decreased by $84 million in fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 and we expect a continued decrease in public safety revenue in early fiscal 2021 with stability and modest recovery later in the year; however, the ultimate extent of the covid-related impact to our public safety business sector remains uncertain.
we expect to see growth and identify new opportunities in our tactical communications business sector, including international growth in the middle east, europe and asia pacific. we also expect modernization demand to continue to benefit both our tactical communications and integrated vision systems business sectors.

pro forma fiscal year ended january 1, 2021 compared with four quarters ended january 3, 2020: the decrease in segment revenue in fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 was primarily due to $681 million of lower commercial aviation sales, including a $364 million impact from the airport security and automation business divestiture and lower revenue from the downturn in the commercial aviation market and its impact on customer operations, partially offset by $189 million of higher revenue in defense aviation, from a ramp on classified programs and combat propulsion systems, and higher faa volume in mission networks.
the segment operating loss in fiscal 2020 compared with segment operating income for the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 was primarily due to $635 million of non-cash charges for impairment of goodwill and other assets, $18 million of restructuring charges and other exit costs recorded in fiscal 2020 in our commercial aviation solutions reporting unit due to the downturn in the commercial aviation market and its impact on customer operations, as well as a $39 million impact from the divestiture of the airport security and automation business, partially offset by operational efficiencies, integration benefits and cost management in fiscal 2020.
additional information on known trends and uncertainties revenue and operating income from our commercial aviation solutions reporting unit declined for 2020 due to decreased commercial training and commercial avionics sales volume, reflecting covid and its impact on global air traffic and customer operations. on a pro forma basis, revenue in our commercial aviation solutions reporting unit decreased by $317 million in fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020, primarily due to covid-related impacts. we expect a continued decline in revenue in our commercial aviation businesses in early fiscal 2021 with stability and modest recovery later in the year; however, the ultimate duration and extent of covid-related impacts to these businesses remains uncertain. in addition, the divestiture of our airport security and automation business on may 4, 2020 decreased segment revenue and operating income in calendar year fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020. customer revenue from the airport security and automation business through the date of divestiture was $147 million compared with $495 million for the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 on a pro forma basis.

*not meaningful fiscal year ended january 1, 2021 compared with four quarters ended january 3, 2020:  the decrease in unallocated corporate expense in fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 on both an as reported and pro forma basis was primarily due to $111 million of lower cost of sales related to the fair value step-up in inventory sold in fiscal 2020 and a $22 million gain on sale of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by higher l3harris merger-related equity compensation expense, the timing of expense accruals, a $14 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to a potential divestiture, and $13 million of higher divestiture-related expenses in fiscal 2020.
two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with two quarters ended december 28, 2018: the increase in unallocated corporate expense during the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended december 28, 2018 was due to $142 million of additional cost of sales related to the fair value step-up in inventory sold and a $10 million non-cash cumulative adjustment to lease expense, partially offset by a $12 million gain on the sale of an asset group in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020.

we ended fiscal 2020 with cash and cash equivalents of $1,276 million, and we have a senior unsecured $2 billion revolving credit facility that expires in june 2024 (all of which was available to us as of january 1, 2021). additionally, we had $6.9 billion of net long-term debt outstanding at january 1, 2021, the majority of which we incurred in connection with our the l3harris merger in the fiscal transition period and the acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. for further information regarding our long-term debt, see note 14: debt in the notes. our $1,276 million of cash and cash equivalents at january 1, 2021 included $296 million held by our foreign subsidiaries, a significant portion of which we believe can be repatriated to the u.s. with minimal tax cost.
given our current cash position, outlook for funds generated from operations, credit ratings, available credit facility, cash needs and debt structure, we have not experienced to date, and do not expect to experience, any material issues with liquidity, although we can give no assurances concerning our future liquidity, particularly in light of our current level of debt, u.s. government budget uncertainties and the state of global commerce and general political and financial uncertainty. we cannot predict the impact that covid, among other potential risks and uncertainties, will have on our cash from operations. for further information regarding covid-related risks and uncertainties, see part i, "item 1a. risk factors" in this report.
based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, funds generated from operations, our credit facility and access to the public and private debt and equity markets will be sufficient to provide for our anticipated working capital requirements, capital expenditures, dividend payments, repurchases under our share repurchase program and repayments of our debt securities at maturity for the next twelve months and reasonably foreseeable future thereafter. our total capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 are expected to be approximately $375 million. we anticipate tax payments for fiscal 2021 to be approximately equal to or marginally less than our tax expense for the same period, subject to adjustment for certain timing differences. for additional information regarding our income taxes, see note 23: income taxes in the notes. other than those cash outlays noted in the "contractual obligations" discussion below in this md&a, capital expenditures, dividend payments, repurchases under our share repurchase program and l3harris merger-related transaction and integration costs, we do not anticipate any significant cash outlays in fiscal 2021. for additional information regarding potential repurchases of our common stock, see note 28: subsequent events in the notes. for further information regarding covid-related risks and uncertainties, see part i, "item 1a. risk factors" in this report.
there can be no assurance, however, that our business will continue to generate cash flows at current levels or that the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program or our credit facility or in the debt markets will not be impacted by any potential future credit or capital markets disruptions. for example, the commercial paper market was temporarily disrupted in march 2020 as a result of covid, and although commercial paper markets are currently functioning in a normal manner, depending on future market conditions and volatility, commercial paper may not be available on favorable terms or at all, or in the capacity desired. if we are unable to maintain cash balances, generate sufficient cash flow from operations or borrow under our commercial paper program or our credit facility sufficient to service our obligations, we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, reduce or eliminate strategic acquisitions, reduce or terminate our share repurchases, reduce or eliminate dividends, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. our ability to make principal payments or pay interest on or refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to general conditions in or affecting the defense, government and other markets we serve and to general economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors beyond our control.
net cash provided by operating activities: the $1,135 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 was primarily due to the impact of higher income (excluding the impacts of a $721 million increase in non-cash impairments of goodwill and other assets and $461 million increase in depreciation and amortization in fiscal 2020), reflecting the inclusion of cash flows from l3 operations following the l3harris merger, as well as a $302 million voluntary contribution to our u.s. qualified pension plans and $278 million of cash used for l3harris merger transaction costs, including change in control charges, in the four quarters ended january 3, 2020, partially offset by a $306 million increase in cash used to fund working capital in fiscal 2020.
the $470 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended december 28, 2018 was primarily due to the impact of higher income, including a $229 million pre-tax gain on sale of business, $182 million decrease in net cash used to fund working capital and $157 million more in share-based compensation, partially offset by $328 million more in qualified pension contributions, including a $302 million voluntary contribution, in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020.
cash flow from operations was positive in all of our business segments in fiscal 2020, the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 and fiscal 2019 and 2018.
net cash provided by investing activities: the $477 million decrease in net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 was primarily due to $1,130 million of net cash received from the l3harris merger in the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 and $101 million increase in cash used for additions of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by a $697 million increase in net proceeds from sales businesses and $91 million of proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2020.
the $1.4 billion increase in net cash provided by investing activities in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended december 28, 2018 was primarily due to $1.1 billion of net cash received from l3harris merger and $343 million of net proceeds from the sale of the harris night vision business, partially offset by a $106 million increase in cash used for additions of property, plant and equipment.
net cash used in financing activities: the $702 million increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2020 compared with the four quarters ended january 3, 2020 was primarily due to a $790 million increase in cash used to repurchase our common stock, a $226 million increase in cash used to pay dividends, a $121 million increase in cash used for repayments of borrowings, a $85 million decrease in proceeds from exercises of employee stock options and $81 million of payments of interest rate derivatives obligations, partially offset by a $504 million increase in net proceeds from borrowings and a $87 million decrease in cash used for tax withholding payments associated with vested share-based awards in fiscal 2020.
the $1.6 billion increase in net cash used in financing activities in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended december 28, 2018 was primarily due to a $1.3 billion increase in cash used to repurchase our common stock, a $174 million increase in cash used to pay dividends, a $502 million increase in net cash used for repayments of borrowings and a $66 million increase in cash used for tax withholding payments associated with vested share-based awards, partially offset by a $370 million increase in net proceeds from borrowings and a $91 million increase in proceeds from exercises of employee stock options.
funding of pension plans funding requirements under applicable laws and regulations are a major consideration in making contributions to our u.s. pension plans. although we have significant discretion in making voluntary contributions, the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended by the pension protection act of 2006 and further amended by the worker, retiree, and employer recovery act of 2008, the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act ("map-21") and applicable internal revenue code regulations mandate minimum funding thresholds. failure to satisfy the minimum funding thresholds could result in restrictions on our ability to amend the plan or make benefit payments. with respect to our u.s. qualified defined benefit pension plans, we intend to contribute annually not less than the required minimum funding thresholds.
the highway and transportation funding act of 2014 and the bipartisan budget act of 2015 further extended the interest rate stabilization provision of map-21 until 2020. we made a $302 million voluntary contribution to our u.s. qualified defined benefit pension plans in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020. as a result of this voluntary contribution, as well as $300 million and $400 million of voluntary contributions in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, we are not required to make any contributions to our u.s. qualified defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2021 and for several years thereafter.
future required contributions primarily will depend on the actual annual return on assets and the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation at the end of each year. depending on these factors, and the resulting funded status of our pension plans, the level of future statutory required minimum contributions could be material. we had net unfunded defined benefit pension plan obligations of $1.8 billion as of january 1, 2021 compared with $1.7 billion as of january 3, 2020. see note 15: pension and other postretirement benefits in the notes for further information regarding our defined benefit pension plans.
common stock repurchases during fiscal 2020, we used $2.3 billion to repurchase 12.0 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at an average price per share of $191.42, including commissions of $.02 per share. during the two quarters ended january 3, 2020, we repurchased 7.4 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program for $1.5 billion at an average price per share of $203.92, including commissions of $.02 per share. we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under our prior repurchase program during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2019. in fiscal 2020, $4 million in shares of our common stock were delivered to us or withheld by us to satisfy withholding taxes on employee share-based awards. in two quarters ended january 3, 2020, $86 million in shares of our common stock were delivered to us or withheld by us to satisfy withholding taxes on employee share-based awards. shares repurchased by us are cancelled and retired.
on july 1, 2019, we announced that our board of directors approved our 2019 repurchase program, a new share repurchase program with a $4 billion share repurchase authorization replacing our prior share repurchase programs. our repurchase program does not have a stated expiration date and authorizes us to repurchase shares of our common stock through open market purchases, private transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions or any combination thereof. at january 1, 2021, we had a remaining, unused authorization under our repurchase program of $210 million. as discussed in more detail in note 28: subsequent events in the notes, on january 28, 2021, we announced that our board of directors approved a new $6 billion share repurchase authorization under our repurchase program that was in addition to the remaining unused authorization of $210 million, for a total unused authorization of $6.2 billion. we have announced that we currently expect to repurchase up to $2.3 billion in shares under our repurchase program in fiscal 2021, exclusive of any proceeds from divestitures we may complete, but we can give no assurances regarding the level and timing of shares repurchases. the level and timing of our repurchases depends on a number of factors, including our financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors our board and management may deem relevant. the timing, volume and nature of repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable securities laws and other factors and are at our discretion and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. additional information regarding our repurchase program is set forth above under "item 5. market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" of this report. for additional information regarding potential repurchases of our common stock, see note 28: subsequent events in the notes.
dividends on january 28, 2021, we announced that our board of directors increased the quarterly per share cash dividend rate on our common stock from $.85 to $1.02, commencing with the dividend declared by our board of directors for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, for an annualized per share cash dividend rate of $4.08, which was our twentieth consecutive annual increase in our quarterly cash dividend rate. our annualized per share cash dividend rate was $3.40 in fiscal 2020, $3.00 in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020, and $2.74 and $2.28 in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. quarterly cash dividends are typically paid in march, june, september and december. we currently expect that cash dividends will continue to be paid in the near future, but we can give no assurances concerning payment of future dividends or future dividend increases. the declaration of dividends and the amount thereof will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. additional information concerning our dividends is set forth above under "item 5. market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" of this report.
capital structure and resources
2019 credit agreement: we have a $2 billion, 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "2019 credit facility") under a revolving credit agreement (the "2019 credit agreement") entered into on june 28, 2019 with a syndicate of lenders. the description of the 2019 credit facility and the 2019 credit agreement set forth in note 13: credit arrangements in the notes is incorporated herein by reference.
we were in compliance with the covenants in the 2019 credit agreement at january 1, 2021, including the covenant requiring that we not permit our ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to total capital, each as defined in the 2019 credit agreement, to be greater than 0.65 to 1.00. at january 1, 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding under the 2019 credit agreement.
exchange offer: in connection with the l3harris merger, on may 30, 2019, we commenced offers to eligible holders to exchange any and all outstanding 4.950% senior notes due 2021, 3.850% senior notes due 2023, 3.950% senior notes due 2024, 3.850% senior notes due 2026 and 4.400% senior notes due 2028 issued by l3 for up to $3.35 billion aggregate principal amount of new notes issued by l3harris and cash. on july 2, 2019, we settled the debt exchange offer, and on march 31, 2020, we commenced offers to eligible holders to exchange any and all the outstanding notes that were previously issued by l3harris pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act ("original notes") for an equal principal amount of new notes registered under the securities act (the "exchange notes"). the terms of the exchange notes are substantially identical to the terms of the corresponding series of the original notes, except that the exchange notes are registered under the securities act, and the transfer restrictions, registration rights and related special interest provisions applicable to the original notes do not apply to the exchange notes. the exchange offers expired at 5:00 p.m., new york city time, on may 1, 2020. on may 5, 2020, we settled the exchange offers and issued exchange notes for validly tendered original notes. see note 14: debt in the notes for additional information.
short-term debt: our short-term debt at january 1, 2021 and january 3, 2020 was $2 million and $3 million, respectively, consisting of local borrowing by international subsidiaries for working capital needs. our commercial paper program was supported by the 2019 credit facility at january 1, 2021 and january 3, 2020. see note 13: credit arrangements in the notes for additional information regarding credit arrangements.
long-term variable-rate debt: the description of our long-term variable-rate debt set forth in note 14: debt in the notes is incorporated herein by reference. as discussed in note 14: debt in the notes, during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we completed the issuance and sale of $250 million in aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due march 10, 2023 and used the net proceeds from the sale to repay in full the entire outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of our floating rate notes due april 30, 2020 that had been issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
long-term fixed-rate debt: the description of our long-term fixed-rate debt set forth in note 14: debt in the notes is incorporated herein by reference. as discussed in note 14: debt in the notes, on november 25, 2020, we completed the issuance and sale of $650 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.80% notes due january 15, 2031 (the "1.80% 2031 notes") and used the proceeds from the sale to redeem the entire outstanding $650 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.95% notes due february 15, 2021 (the "4.95% 2021 notes") ( $501 million of which was issued by l3harris and $149 million of which was issued by l3). on november 27, 2019, we completed the issuance and sale of $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.900% notes due december 15, 2029 and used the proceeds from the sale to redeem the entire outstanding $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.7% notes due april 27, 2020 (the "2.7% 2020 notes") at a "make-whole" redemption price of $403 million, as set forth in the 2.7% 2020 notes. the 4.95% 2021 notes and 2.7% 2020 notes were terminated and cancelled.
other agreements: we have a receivable sales agreement ("rsa") with a third-party financial institution that permits us to sell, on a non-recourse basis, up to $100 million of outstanding receivables at any given time. from time to time, we have sold certain customer receivables under the rsa, which we continue to service and collect on behalf of the third-party financial institution and which we account for as sales of receivables with sale proceeds included in net cash from operating activities. the impact to net cash from operating activities from these transactions was not material in fiscal 2020, the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 or in fiscal 2019 or 2018.
operating lease commitments                     997                          148                             243                           181                           425
minimum pension contributions (2)                 6                            6                               -                             -                             -
(1) the purchase obligations of $3.7 billion included $570 million of purchase obligations related to cost-plus type contracts where our costs are fully reimbursable.
(2) amount includes fiscal 2021 minimum contributions to non-u.s. pension plans. contributions beyond fiscal 2021 have not been determined. during the two quarters ended january 3, 2020, we made voluntary contributions of $302 million to our u.s. qualified defined benefit pension plans. as a result of this voluntary contribution, as well as $700 million of voluntary contributions made in fiscal 2018 and 2017, we made no material contributions to our u.s. qualified defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2020 and are not required to make any contributions to these plans during fiscal 2021.
(3) the above table does not include unrecognized tax benefits of $542 million.
off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the definition under sec rules, any of the following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements:
•a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets;
•any obligation, including a contingent obligation, arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that is held by, and material to, the registrant, where such entity provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in leasing, hedging or r&d services with the registrant.
as of january 1, 2021, we were not participating in any material transactions that generated relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including variable interest entities, and we did not have any material retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above. as of january 1, 2021, we did not have material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments that are reasonably likely to adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or equity, and we were not a party to any related party transactions that materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or equity.
we have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses and assets. in connection with these divestitures, we often provide representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as environmental liabilities and tax liabilities. we cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. we do not believe, however, that the liabilities relating to these representations, warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or equity.
due to our downsizing of certain operations pursuant to acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring plans or otherwise, certain properties leased by us have been sublet to third parties. if any of these third parties vacates any of these premises, we would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. we believe that the financial risk of default by such sub lessees is individually and in the aggregate not material to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or equity.
commercial commitments we have entered into commercial commitments in the normal course of business including surety bonds, standby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts to provide products and services to customers or to obtain insurance policies with our insurance carriers. at january 1, 2021, we had commercial commitments on outstanding surety bonds, standby letters of credit and other arrangements, as follows:
expiration of commitments
1 year surety bonds used for:
performance                                     488                      354                          17                        109                              8
standby letters of credit used for:
performance                                     305                      147                          65                         14                             79
total commitments                            $1,219                     $743                        $169                       $160                           $147
the surety bonds and standby letters of credit used for performance are primarily related to our public safety business sector. as is customary in bidding for and completing network infrastructure projects for public safety systems, contractors are required to procure surety bonds and/or standby letters of credit for bids, performance, warranty and other purposes (collectively, "performance bonds"). such performance bonds normally have maturities of up to three years and are standard in the industry as a way to provide customers a mechanism to seek redress if a contractor does not satisfy performance requirements under a contract. typically, a customer is permitted to draw on a performance bond if we do not fulfill all terms of a project contract. in such an event, we would be obligated to reimburse the financial institution that issued the performance bond for the amounts paid. it has been rare for our public safety business sector to have a performance bond drawn upon. in addition, pursuant to the terms under which we procure performance bonds, if our credit ratings are lowered to below "investment grade," we may be required to provide collateral to support a portion of the outstanding amount of performance bonds. such a downgrade could increase the cost of the issuance of performance bonds and could make it more difficult to procure performance bonds, which would adversely impact our ability to compete for contract awards. such collateral requirements could also result in less liquidity for other operational needs or corporate purposes. in addition, any future disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in financial and insurance markets could also adversely affect our ability to obtain performance bonds and may result in higher funding costs.
financial risk management in the normal course of business, we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.
foreign exchange and currency: our u.s. and foreign businesses enter into contracts with customers, subcontractors or vendors that are denominated in currencies other than functional currencies of such businesses. we use foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge both balance sheet and off-balance sheet future foreign currency commitments. factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging programs for foreign currency include accuracy of sales estimates, volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments. a 10 percent change in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency derivatives held at january 1, 2021 would not have had a material impact on the fair value of such instruments or our results of operations or cash flows. this quantification of exposure to the market risk associated with foreign currency financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair value of our foreign denominated assets, liabilities and firm commitments. see note 20: derivative instruments and hedging activities in the notes for additional information.
interest rates: as of january 1, 2021, we had long-term fixed-rate debt obligations. the fair value of these obligations is impacted by changes in interest rates; however, a 10 percent change in interest rates for our long-term fixed-rate debt obligations at january 1, 2021 would not have had a material impact on the fair value of these obligations. there is no interest-rate risk associated with long-term fixed-rate debt obligations on our results of operations and cash flows unless existing obligations are refinanced upon maturity at then-current interest rates, because the interest rates are fixed until maturity, and because our long-term fixed-rate debt is not putable to us (i.e., not required to be redeemed by us prior to maturity). we can give no assurances, however, that interest rates will not change significantly or have a material effect on the fair value of our long-term fixed-rate debt obligations over the next twelve months. see note 14: debt in the notes for information regarding the maturities of our long-term fixed-rate debt obligations.
we use derivative instruments from time to time to manage our exposure to interest rate risk associated with our anticipated issuance of new long-term fixed-rate notes to repay at maturity our existing long-term fixed-rate debt obligations. if the derivative instrument is designated as a cash flow hedge, gains and losses from changes in the fair value of such instrument are deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to interest expense in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. see note 20: derivative instruments and hedging activities in the notes for additional information.
at january 1, 2021, we had no outstanding treasury lock agreements ("treasury locks"). in connection with the l3harris merger, we assumed two treasury locks that had been initiated in january 2019 to hedge against fluctuations in interest payments due to changes in the benchmark interest rate (10-year u.s. treasury rate) associated with the anticipated issuance of debt to redeem or repay our 4.95% 2021 notes. these treasury locks were terminated as planned in connection with our issuance of our 1.80% 2031 notes during the fourth quarter of 2020, and because interest rates decreased during the period of the treasury locks, we made a $113 million cash payment to our counterparty and recorded an after-tax loss of $58 million in the "accumulated other comprehensive loss" line item of our consolidated balance sheet. the accumulated other comprehensive loss balance will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the 1.80% 2031 notes. we classified the cash outflow from the termination of these treasury locks as cash used in financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. see note 20: derivative instruments and hedging activities in the notes for additional information.
at january 1, 2021, we also had long-term variable-rate debt obligations of $250 million of floating rate notes due march 10, 2023. these debt obligations bear interest that is variable based on certain short-term indices, thus exposing us to interest-rate risk; however, a 10 percent change in interest rates for these debt obligations at january 1, 2021 would not have had a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. see note 14: debt in the notes for further information.
we have also used short-term variable-rate debt borrowings, primarily under our commercial paper program, which are subject to interest rate risk. we utilize our commercial paper program to satisfy short-term cash requirements, including bridge financing for strategic acquisitions until longer-term financing arrangements are put in place, temporarily funding repurchases under our share repurchase programs and temporarily funding redemption of long-term debt. the interest rate risk associated with such debt on our results of operations and cash flows is not material due to its temporary nature.
impact of foreign exchange in fiscal 2020, 32 percent of our international business was transacted in local currency environments compared with 40 percent in the two quarters ended january 3, 2020, 18 percent in fiscal 2019 and 22 percent in fiscal 2018. the impact of translating the assets and liabilities of these operations to u.s. dollars is included as a component of shareholders' equity. as of january 1, 2021, the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment included in shareholders' equity was a $58 million loss compared with a $81 million loss at january 3, 2020. we utilize foreign currency hedging instruments to minimize the currency risk of international transactions. gains and losses resulting from currency rate fluctuations did not have a material effect on our results in fiscal 2020, the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 or fiscal 2019 or 2018.
impact of inflation to the extent feasible, we have consistently followed the practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the cost of purchased materials and services. inflation and changing prices did not materially adversely impact our gross margin, revenue or operating income in fiscal 2020, the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 or fiscal 2019 or 2018.
critical accounting policies and estimates the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies or estimates. our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1: significant accounting policies in the notes. in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances, we apply our accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in the notes. we consider the policies and estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment, with financial reporting results dependent on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs. the impact and any associated risks related to these estimates on our business operations are discussed throughout this md&a where such estimates affect our reported and expected financial results. senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and the related disclosure included herein with the audit committee of our board of directors. preparation of this report requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and backlog as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. actual results may differ from those estimates.
besides estimates that meet the "critical" accounting estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. all estimates, whether or not deemed "critical," affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, including for estimates that we do not deem "critical."
revenue recognition a significant portion of our business is derived from development and production contracts. revenue and profit related to development and production contracts are generally recognized over time, typically using the percentage of completion ("poc") cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition, whereby we measure our progress towards completion of the performance obligation based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to estimated costs at completion under the contract. because costs incurred represent work performed, we believe this method best depicts the transfer of control of the asset to the customer. under the poc cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition, a single estimated profit margin is used to recognize profit for each performance obligation over its period of performance. recognition of profit on a contract requires estimates of the total cost at completion and transaction price and the measurement of progress towards completion. due to the long-term nature of many of our contracts, developing the estimated total cost at completion and total transaction price often requires judgment. factors that must be considered in estimating the cost of the work to be completed include: the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, subcontractor performance and the risk and impact of delayed performance. factors that must be considered in estimating the total transaction price include contractual cost or performance incentives (such as incentive fees, award fees and penalties) and other forms of variable consideration as well as our historical experience and our expectation for performance on the contract. these variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain negotiated performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion. we include such estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.
at the outset of each contract, we gauge its complexity and perceived risks and establish an estimated total cost at completion in line with these expectations. after establishing the estimated total cost at completion, we follow a standard estimate at completion ("eac") process in which we review the progress and performance on our ongoing contracts at least quarterly and, in many cases, more frequently. if we successfully retire risks associated with the technical, schedule and cost aspects of a contract, we may lower our estimated total cost at completion commensurate with the retirement of these risks. conversely, if we are not successful in retiring these risks, we may increase our estimated total cost at completion. additionally, as the contract progresses, our estimates of total transaction price may increase or decrease if, for example, we receive award fees that are higher or lower than expected. when adjustments in estimated total costs at completion or in estimated total transaction price are determined, the related impact on operating income is recognized using the cumulative catch-up method, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of such adjustments for all prior periods. any anticipated losses on these contracts are fully recognized in the period in which the losses become evident.
eac adjustments had the following impacts to operating income for the periods presented:
there were no individual impacts to operating income due to eac adjustments in fiscal 2020, the two quarters ended january 3, 2020 or fiscal 2019 or 2018 that were material to our results of operations on a consolidated or segment basis for such periods.
we recognize revenue from numerous contracts with multiple performance obligations. for these contracts, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price of the good or service underlying each performance obligation. the standalone selling price represents the amount for which we would sell the good or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not sold as bundled sale with any other products or services). the allocation of transaction price among separate performance obligations may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.
a substantial majority of our revenue is derived from contracts with the u.s. government, including foreign military sales contracts. these contracts are subject to the far and the prices of our contract deliverables are typically based on our estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. as a result, the standalone selling prices of the goods and services in these contracts are typically equal to the selling prices stated in the contract, thereby eliminating the need to allocate (or reallocate) the transaction price to the multiple performance obligations. in our non-u.s. government contracts, when standalone selling prices are not directly observable, we also generally use the expected cost plus a margin approach to determine standalone selling price. in determining the appropriate margin under the cost plus margin approach, we consider historical margins on similar products sold to similar customers or within similar geographies where objective evidence is available. we may also consider our cost structure and profit objectives, the nature of the proposal, the effects of customization of pricing, our practices used to establish pricing of bundled products, the expected technological life of the product, margins earned on similar contracts with different customers and other factors to determine the appropriate margin.
postretirement benefit plans certain of our current and former employees participate in defined benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans (collectively, referred to as "defined benefit plans") in the united states, canada, united kingdom and germany, which are sponsored by l3harris. the determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to defined benefit plans are dependent on various assumptions. these major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates, long-term expected rates of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, mortality, termination and other factors (some of which are disclosed in note 15: pension and other postretirement benefits in the notes). actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and generally amortized for each plan to the extent required over the estimated future life expectancy or, if applicable, the future working lifetime of the plan's active participants.
as part of our accounting for the l3harris merger, we completed a valuation and re-measurement of all l3 pension and other postretirement benefit ("opeb") plans as of the june 29, 2019 closing date of the l3harris merger and we recorded a $233 million increase to l3's pension and opeb liability as of june 29, 2019 based on the results of this valuation. the total l3 pension and opeb liability assumed by l3harris was $1.4 billion at june 29, 2019. the discount rate assumption used was a yield curve rather than a single interest rate. for the pension plans, the average june 29, 2019 discount rate used was 3.54 percent for u.s. plans and 2.95 percent for canadian plans. for opeb plans, the average june 29, 2019 discount rate used was 3.31 percent for u.s. plans and 2.92 percent for canadian plans.
significant assumptions. we develop assumptions using relevant experience, in conjunction with market-related data for each plan. assumptions are reviewed annually with third party consultants and adjusted as appropriate. the table included below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost as they pertain to our defined benefit pension plans.
cash balance interest crediting rate                               3.50%                   3.50%
cost assumptions for fiscal periods ended:               january 1, 2021         january 3, 2020
expected return on plan assets                                     7.68%                   7.68%
cash balance interest crediting rate                               3.50%                   3.50%
key assumptions for the salaried pension plan (our largest defined benefit plan, with 85% of the total projected benefit obligation as of january 1, 2021) included a discount rate for obligation assumptions of 2.32%, a cash balance interest crediting rate of 3.50% and expected return on plan assets of 7.75% for fiscal 2020, which is being decreased to 7.50% for fiscal 2021. there is also a frozen pension equity benefit that assumes a 3.25% interest crediting rate.
expected return on plan assets. substantially all of our plan assets are managed on a commingled basis in a master investment trust. we determine our expected return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns. specifically, we consider the plan's actual historical annual return on assets over the past 15, 20 and 25 years and historical broad market returns over long-term time frames based on our strategic allocation, which is detailed in note 15: pension and other postretirement benefits in the notes. future returns are based on independent estimates of long-term asset class returns. based on this approach, the weighted average long-term annual rate of return on assets was estimated to be 7.68% for fiscal 2020 and is estimated to be 25 basis points lower for fiscal 2021.
discount rate. the discount rate is used to calculate the present value of expected future benefit payments at the measurement date. a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and generally decreases pension expense. the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period. the pension discount rate is determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising aaa/aa bonds, with maturities between zero and thirty years, developed by the plan's actuaries. annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a single discount rate matching the plan's characteristics.
sensitivity analysis pension expense. a 25 basis point change in the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate would have the following effect on the combined u.s. defined benefit pension plans' pension expense for the next twelve months:
(in millions)                                                                          25 basis                            25 basis point increase                      point decrease long-term rate of return on assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost         $(20)                               $20
discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost                              $3                                  $(3)
projected benefit obligation. funded status is derived by subtracting the respective year-end values of the projected benefit obligations ("pbo") from the fair value of plan assets. the sensitivity of the pbo to changes in the discount rate varies depending on the magnitude and direction of the change in the discount rate. we estimate that a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate of the combined u.s. defined benefit pension plans would increase the pbo by approximately $320 million and an increase of 25 basis points would decrease the pbo by approximately $303 million.
fair value of plan assets. the plan assets of our defined benefit plans comprise a broad range of investments, including domestic and international equity securities, fixed income investments, interests in private equity and hedge funds and cash and cash equivalents.
a portion of our defined benefit plans asset portfolio is comprised of investments in private equity and hedge funds. the private equity and hedge fund investments are generally measured using the valuation of the underlying investments or at net asset value. however, in certain instances, the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date. consequently, we have estimated adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date. these adjustments consider information received from the asset managers, as well as general market information. asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices. see note 15: pension and other postretirement benefits in the notes for further information.
goodwill goodwill in our consolidated balance sheet as of january 1, 2021 and january 3, 2020 was $18.9 billion and $20.0 billion, respectively. goodwill is not amortized. we perform annual (or under certain circumstances, more frequent) impairment tests of our goodwill. we identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with its carrying amount, including goodwill, which is adjusted for allocations of corporate assets and liabilities as appropriate. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
l3harris merger goodwill allocation. as discussed in more detail in note 25: business segments in the notes, after the completion of the l3harris merger, we adjusted our segment reporting to reflect our new organizational structure effective june 29, 2019. immediately before and after our goodwill assignments, we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment under our former and new segment reporting structure and determined that no impairment existed. see note 5: business combination and note 10: goodwill in the notes for additional information.
airport security and automation business goodwill allocation. as described in more detail in note 3: business divestitures and asset sales in the notes, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our airport security and automation business on february 4, 2020 and completed the sale on may 4, 2020. because the divestiture of the airport security and automation business represented the disposal of a portion of a reporting unit within our aviation systems segment, we assigned $531 million of goodwill to the airport security and automation business disposal group on a relative fair value basis. in conjunction with the relative fair value allocation, we tested goodwill assigned to the airport security and automation business disposal group and goodwill assigned to the retained businesses of the reporting unit for impairment and concluded that no goodwill impairment existed at the time the held for sale criteria were met in late january 2020.
eotech business goodwill allocation. as described in more detail in note 3: business divestitures and asset sales in the notes, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our eotech business on march 20, 2020 and completed the sale on july 31, 2020. because the divestiture of the eotech business represented the disposal of a portion of a reporting unit within our communication systems segment, we assigned $9 million of goodwill to the eotech business disposal group on a relative fair value basis. in conjunction with the relative fair value allocation, we tested goodwill assigned to the eotech business disposal group and goodwill assigned to the retained businesses of the reporting unit for impairment and concluded that no goodwill impairment existed.
vse disposal group goodwill allocation and impairment. as described in more detail in note 3: business divestitures and asset sales in the notes, during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we determined the criteria to be classified as held for sale were met with respect to certain portions of our voice switch enterprise business that we planned to divest ("vse disposal group"). the income before income taxes of the vse disposal group was not material for fiscal 2020. because the divestiture of the vse disposal group represented the disposal of a portion of a reporting unit within our aviation systems segment, we assigned $14 million of goodwill to the vse disposal group on a relative fair value basis. in conjunction with the relative fair value allocation, we tested goodwill assigned to the vse disposal group and goodwill assigned to the retained businesses of the reporting unit for impairment and concluded that goodwill related to the vse disposal group was impaired. as a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $14 million, which is included in the "impairment of goodwill and other assets" line item in our consolidated statement of income for fiscal 2020.
harris night vision goodwill allocation. as described in more detail in note 3: business divestitures and asset sales in the notes, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the harris night vision business on april 4, 2019 and completed the sale on september 13, 2019. because the divestiture of the harris night vision business represented the disposal of a portion of a reporting unit within our former communication system segment, we assigned $30 million of goodwill to the harris night vision business disposal group on a relative fair value basis. in conjunction with the relative fair value allocation, we tested goodwill assigned to the harris night vision business disposal group and goodwill assigned to the retained businesses of the reporting unit for impairment and concluded that no goodwill impairment existed.
for purposes of allocating goodwill to the disposal groups above, we determined the fair value of each disposal group based on the respective negotiated selling price (or estimated net cash proceeds, in the case of no negotiated selling price), and the fair value of the retained businesses of the respective reporting unit based on a combination of market-based valuation techniques, utilizing quoted market prices and comparable publicly reported transactions, and projected discounted cash flows. these fair value determinations are categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to their use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. see note 1: significant accounting policies in the notes for additional information regarding the fair value hierarchy.
fiscal 2020 impairment tests. we perform an annual impairment test of our goodwill as of the first day of our fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. following our fiscal year end change, we made a corresponding change to our annual impairment assessment date and continued to perform our annual impairment test on the first day of our fourth quarter, which for the fiscal transition period was september 28, 2019 (the first day of the last quarter of the fiscal transition period) and was october 3, 2020 for fiscal 2020.
we test goodwill for impairment at a level within the company referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or one level below the business segment. some of our segments are comprised of several reporting units. allocation of goodwill to several reporting units could make it more likely that we will have an impairment charge in the future. an impairment charge to one of our reporting units could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. to test goodwill for impairment, we may perform both qualitative and quantitative assessments. if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment for a certain reporting unit, we evaluate events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the probability that goodwill is impaired. if we determine it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative assessment.
our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, whether performed annually or based on specific events or circumstances, considers various macroeconomic, industry-specific and company-specific factors. these factors include: (i) deterioration in the general economy; (ii) deterioration in the environment in which the company operates; (iii) increase in raw materials, labor or other costs; (iv) negative or declining cash flows; (v) changes in management, changes in strategy, or significant litigation; (vi) change in the composition or carrying amount of net assets or an expectation of disposing all or a portion of the reporting unit; or (vii) a sustained decrease in share price.
if we perform a quantitative assessment for a certain reporting unit, we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit's net book value. we estimate fair values of our reporting units based on projected cash flows, and sales and/or earnings multiples applied to the latest twelve months' sales and earnings of our reporting units. projected cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales, operating costs and balance sheet metrics reflecting our view of the financial and market conditions of the underlying business; and the resulting cash flows are discounted using an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk in the forecasted cash flows. the sales and earnings multiples applied to the sales and earnings of our reporting units are based on current multiples of sales and earnings for similar businesses, and based on sales and earnings multiples paid for recent acquisitions of similar businesses made in the marketplace. we then assess whether any implied control premium, based on a comparison of fair value based purely on our stock price and outstanding shares with fair value determined by using all of the above-described models, is reasonable.
indications of potential impairment of goodwill related to our commercial aviation solutions reporting unit (which is part of our aviation systems segment) were present at april 3, 2020 due to covid and its impact on global air traffic and customer operations, resulting in a decrease in fiscal 2020 outlook for the reporting unit, which we considered to be a triggering event requiring an interim impairment test. consequently, in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the quarter ended april 3, 2020, we performed a quantitative impairment test. to test for potential impairment of goodwill related to our commercial aviation solutions reporting unit, we prepared an estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit based on a combination of market-based valuation techniques, utilizing quoted market prices and comparable publicly reported transactions, and projected discounted cash flows. given the level of uncertainty in the outlook for the commercial aviation industry caused by the impact of covid on global air traffic, our methodology for determining the fair value of the reporting unit placed the greatest weight on the expected fair value technique, and was dependent on our best estimates of future sales, operating costs and balance sheet metrics under a range of scenarios for future economic conditions. we assigned a probability to each scenario to calculate a set of probability-weighted projected cash flows, and an appropriate discount rate reflecting the risk in the projected cash flows was used to discount the expected cash flows to present value.
as a result of this impairment test, we concluded that goodwill related to our commercial aviation solutions reporting unit was impaired as of april 3, 2020 and recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $296 million in the first quarter of 2020.
as adverse global economic and market conditions attributable to covid, including projected declines and subsequent recovery in commercial air traffic and original equipment manufacturer production volumes, continued to develop during fiscal 2020, we continued to monitor for facts and circumstances that could negatively impact key valuation assumptions in determining the fair value of our commercial aviation solutions reporting unit, including recent valuations, expectations regarding the timing of a return to pre-covid commercial flight activity and the associated level of uncertainty, long-term revenue and profitability projections, discount rates and general industry, market and macroeconomic conditions. as a result, we determined indications of further impairment of assets related to our commercial aviation solutions reporting unit existed as of july 3, 2020 and again as of early december 2020 and recorded $54 million and $368 million of additional non-cash charges for the impairment of goodwill and other assets during the second and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively. these charges are included in the "impairment of goodwill and other assets" line item in our consolidated statement of income for fiscal 2020 and are primarily not deductible for tax purposes.
we also performed our annual impairment test of all of our other reporting units goodwill as of october 3, 2020 and concluded that the estimated fair values for each of our other reporting units exceeded their carrying values by greater than 10 percent. as of january 1, 2021, the commercial aviation solutions reporting unit has $847 million of goodwill and the estimated fair value approximates the carrying value of the reporting unit.
we are continuing to monitor the impacts of covid on the fair value of our reporting units and do not currently anticipate any further material goodwill impairment charges as a result of covid. however, an impairment of goodwill could result from a number of circumstances, including different assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting units, future deterioration in the business, including from the impact of covid, or a sharp increase in interest rates without a corresponding increase in future revenue.

accounting for business combinations we follow the acquisition method of accounting to record identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests recognized in connection with acquired businesses at their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition.
identifiable intangible assets from business combinations are recognized at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition and generally consist of customer relationships, trade names, developed technology and in-process r&d. determination of the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets requires judgment. the fair value of customer contractual relationships is determined based on estimates and judgments regarding future after-tax earnings and cash flows arising from follow-on sales on contract renewals expected from customer contractual relationships over their estimated lives, including the probability of expected future contract renewals and sales, less a contributory asset charge, all of which is discounted to present value. the fair value of trade name identifiable intangible assets is determined utilizing the relief from royalty method. under this form of the income approach, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the trade name and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. identifiable intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. finite-lived identifiable intangible assets are amortized to expense over their useful lives, generally ranging from three to twenty years. the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the l3harris merger was $8.5 billion.
we assess the recoverability of finite-lived identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. we evaluate the recoverability of such assets based on the expectations of undiscounted cash flows of the assets. if the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss would be recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount. see note 5: business combination and note 11: intangible assets in the notes for additional information.
income taxes we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheet, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary valuation allowances as required. future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law. we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. we have not made any material changes in the methodologies used to determine our tax valuation allowances during fiscal 2020, the fiscal transition period or the previous two fiscal years.
our consolidated balance sheet as of january 1, 2021 included deferred tax assets of $119 million and deferred tax liabilities of $1.24 billion. this compares with deferred tax assets of $102 million and deferred tax liabilities of $1.48 billion as of january 3, 2020. for all jurisdictions for which we have net deferred tax assets, we expect that our existing levels of pre-tax earnings are sufficient to generate the amount of future taxable income needed to realize these tax assets. our valuation allowance related to deferred income taxes, which is reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, was $165 million as of january 1, 2021 compared with $185 million as of january 3, 2020. although we make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of our deferred tax assets, if we continue to operate at a loss in certain jurisdictions or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income, or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, or if the potential impact of tax planning strategies changes, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results.
the evaluation of tax positions taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim, involves inherent uncertainty and requires the use of judgment. we evaluate our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances as of the reporting date. for tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized, we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent probability of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority, assuming the taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant information. for income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized, we do not recognize a tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements.
as of january 1, 2021, we had $542 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $453 million would favorably impact our future tax rates in the event that the tax benefits are eventually recognized. as of january 3, 2020, we had $438 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $313 million would favorably impact our future tax rates in the event that the tax benefits are eventually recognized.
it is reasonably possible that there could be a significant decrease or increase to our unrecognized tax benefits during the course of the next twelve months as ongoing tax examinations continue, other tax examinations commence or various statutes of limitations expire. however, an estimate of the range of possible changes cannot be made for remaining unrecognized tax benefits because of the significant number of jurisdictions in which we do business and the number of open tax periods. see note 23: income taxes in the notes for additional information.
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements accounting pronouncements that have recently been issued but have not yet been implemented by us are described in note 2: accounting changes or recent accounting pronouncements in the notes, which describes the potential impact that these pronouncements are expected to have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or equity.

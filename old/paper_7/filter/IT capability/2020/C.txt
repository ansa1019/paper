management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary as described further throughout this executive summary, during 2020, citi demonstrated solid performance as well as financial strength and operational resilience, despite a significant deterioration in public health and economic conditions during the year due to the covid-19 pandemic:
•citi's earnings were substantially reduced by a higher allowance for credit loss (acl) build (approximately $9.8 billion) during the year under the cecl standard (see "cost of credit" below).
•despite the challenging environment, citi's revenues were largely unchanged from the prior year, as strong performance in fixed income markets, equity markets, investment banking and the private bank in institutional clients group (icg) offset the impact of lower interest rates across the company, as well as the impact of lower customer activity in global consumer banking (gcb), reflecting declines across all regions, and lower revenues in corporate/other.
•citi's expenses reflected continued investments in its transformation, including infrastructure supporting its risk and control environment, as well as a $400 million civil money penalty in the third quarter of 2020 in connection with a consent order citibank entered into with the office of the comptroller of the currency (occ) (for additional information on this consent order and the citigroup consent order with the federal reserve board, see "citi's consent order compliance" below).
•citi had broad-based deposit growth across icg and gcb, reflecting strong client engagement, as well as an elevated level of liquidity in the financial system, while loans declined reflecting lower levels of consumer and corporate activity.
•citi returned $7.2 billion of capital to its common shareholders in the form of dividends and common share repurchases.
•the federal reserve board authorized citi to take certain capital actions during the first quarter of 2021, which allows citi to return capital to common shareholders of up to $2.8 billion, including the previously announced common dividends of $0.51 per share in the quarter. citi commenced share repurchases in february 2021.
•citi continued to support its colleagues, customers, clients and communities as well as the broader economy during this challenging time (see "covid-19 pandemic overview" below), while maintaining a strong balance sheet.
the economic outlook for 2021 reflects continued challenges and uncertainties related to the pandemic, including, among others, the duration and severity of the public health crisis and associated economic impacts, which have created a more volatile operating environment that will continue to negatively impact citi's businesses and results.
as a result of new information citi received subsequent to december 31, 2020, citi adjusted downward its fourth quarter of 2020 financial results from those previously reported on january 15, 2021 (and filed on a form 8-k with the sec on such date), due to a $390 million increase in operating expenses ($323 million after-tax) recorded within icg, resulting from operational losses related to certain legal matters. for additional information on the impact to fourth quarter of 2020 financial results, see note 30 to the consolidated financial statements. citi's results of operations and financial condition for the full year 2020, as reported in this annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020, reflect the impact of this adjustment.
for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that will or could impact citi's businesses, results of operations and financial condition during 2021, see "covid-19 pandemic overview," "risk factors," each respective business's results of operations and "managing global risk" below.
2020 results summary citigroup citigroup reported net income of $11.0 billion, or $4.72 per share, compared to net income of $19.4 billion, or $8.04 per share, in the prior year. net income declined 43%, driven by significantly higher credit costs and higher expenses, while revenues remained largely unchanged. earnings per share decreased 41%, primarily driven by the decline in net income.
citigroup revenues of $74.3 billion were largely unchanged from the prior year, as higher revenues in icg offset lower revenues in gcb and corporate/other.
citigroup's end-of-period loans decreased 3% from the prior year to $676 billion. excluding the impact of foreign currency translation into u.s. dollars for reporting purposes (fx translation), citigroup's end-of-period loans declined 4%, driven by a 4% aggregate decline in gcb and icg, reflecting lower spend activity in gcb as well as a higher level of repayments in both gcb and icg. citigroup's end-of-period deposits increased 20% to $1.3 trillion. excluding the impact of fx translation, citigroup's end-of-period deposits increased 19%, primarily driven by 18% growth in gcb and 19% growth in icg. (citi's results of operations excluding the impact of fx translation are non-gaap financial measures. citi believes the presentation of its results of operations and financial condition excluding the impact of fx translation provides a meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses for investors, industry analysts and others.)
expenses citigroup operating expenses of $43.2 billion increased 3% versus the prior year, primarily driven by investments in citi's transformation, including infrastructure supporting its risk and control environment, higher compensation, the civil money penalty, operational losses related to certain legal matters and pandemic-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings and reductions in marketing and other discretionary spending. operating expenses in gcb declined 2%, while icg expenses increased 6% and corporate/other expenses increased 16%.
cost of credit citi's total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims of $17.5 billion increased significantly from $8.4 billion in the prior year, reflecting acl reserve increases across gcb, icg and corporate/other. citi's acl build of $9.8 billion was largely driven by builds during the first half of 2020. the reserve build in 2020 primarily reflected the impact of a deterioration in citi's macroeconomic outlook under the cecl standard and downgrades in the corporate loan portfolio, partially offset by lower loan volumes in gcb, all driven by the pandemic. the reserve build included an additional qualitative management adjustment to reflect the potential for a higher level of stress and a slower economic recovery. for further information on the drivers of citi's acl build, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates-allowance for credit losses" below. for information on the transition impact of the adoption of the cecl standard, see "covid-19 pandemic overview" below.
net credit losses of $7.6 billion declined 2% from the prior year. consumer net credit losses of $6.6 billion decreased 10%, primarily reflecting lower loan volumes given lower spending activity and higher payment rates, as well as the benefits of consumer relief programs (see "covid-19 pandemic overview" below). corporate net credit losses increased from $392 million to $1.0 billion, primarily driven by write-offs across various sectors, which were partially offset by the release of previously established acl reserves.
for additional information on citi's consumer and corporate credit costs and acl, see each respective business's results of operations and "credit risk" below.
capital citigroup's common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 11.7% as of december 31, 2020, based on the basel iii advanced approaches framework for determining risk-weighted assets, compared to 11.8% as of december 31, 2019, based on the basel iii standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. the decline in the ratio primarily reflected an increase in risk-weighted assets and the return of capital to common shareholders, partially offset by net income and beneficial net movements in accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci).
citigroup's supplementary leverage ratio was 7.0% as of december 31, 2020, compared to 6.2% as of december 31, 2019. the increase was primarily driven by a decrease in total leverage exposure, reflecting the benefit of temporary relief granted by the federal reserve board. for additional information on citi's capital ratios and related components, see "capital resources" below.
global consumer banking gcb net income of $878 million declined 85% from the prior year. excluding the impact of fx translation, net income declined 84%, reflecting lower revenues and higher cost of credit, partially offset by lower expenses. gcb operating expenses of $17.2 billion decreased 2%. excluding the impact of fx translation, expenses decreased 1%, as lower volume-
related expenses, reductions in marketing and other discretionary spending and efficiency savings were partially offset by increases in pandemic-related expenses and higher repositioning costs.
gcb revenues of $30.0 billion decreased 9%. excluding the impact of fx translation, revenues decreased 8%, as strong deposit growth and momentum in wealth management were more than offset by lower card volumes and lower interest rates across all regions, reflecting the impact of the pandemic.
north america gcb revenues of $19.1 billion decreased 6%, with lower revenues across citi-branded cards, citi retail services and retail banking. citi-branded cards revenues of $8.8 billion decreased 4%, reflecting lower purchase sales and higher payment rates driving lower average loans. citi retail services revenues of $5.9 billion decreased 12%, reflecting lower average loans as well as higher partner payments. retail banking revenues of $4.5 billion decreased 2%, as the benefit of stronger deposit volumes and an improvement in mortgage revenues were more than offset by lower deposit spreads.
north america gcb average deposits of $176 billion increased 15% year-over-year, average retail banking loans of $52 billion increased 8% year-over-year and assets under management of $80 billion increased 11%. average citi-branded cards loans of $85 billion decreased 6% and citi-branded cards purchase sales of $338 billion decreased 8%, while average citi retail services loans of $47 billion decreased 7% and citi retail services purchase sales of $78 billion decreased 11%. the decline in citi-branded cards and retail services loans and purchase sales were all driven by reduced customer activity related to the pandemic. for additional information on the results of operations of north america gcb in 2020, see "global consumer banking-north america gcb" below.
international gcb revenues (consisting of latin america gcb and asia gcb (which includes the results of operations in certain emea countries)) of $10.8 billion declined 14% versus the prior year. excluding the impact of fx translation, international gcb revenues declined 10%, largely reflecting the impact of the pandemic. on this basis, latin america gcb revenues decreased 8%, driven by lower average loans and lower interest rates, partially offset by strong deposit growth. asia gcb revenues decreased 11%, as lower card revenues and the impact of lower interest rates were partially offset by strong investment revenues and strong deposit growth. for additional information on the results of operations of latin america gcb and asia gcb in 2020, including the impact of fx translation, see "global consumer banking-latin america gcb" and "global consumer banking-asia gcb" below.
year-over-year, excluding the impact of fx translation, international gcb average deposits of $135 billion increased 11%, average retail banking loans of $72 billion increased 3% and assets under management of $141 billion increased 8%. on this basis, international gcb average card loans of $22 billion decreased 8% and card purchase sales of $88 billion decreased 16%, both driven by reduced customer activity related to the pandemic.
institutional clients group icg net income of $11.7 billion decreased 9%, as revenue growth was more than offset by higher cost of credit and higher expenses. icg operating expenses increased 6% to $23.5 billion, largely driven by investments in infrastructure and risk management and controls, higher compensation costs, operational losses related to certain legal matters and volume-driven growth, partially offset by efficiency savings.
icg revenues of $44.3 billion increased 13%, reflecting a 29% increase in markets and securities services revenues, partially offset by a 1% decline in banking revenues. the decrease in banking revenues included the impact of $51 million of losses on loan hedges related to corporate lending and the private bank, compared to losses of $432 million related to corporate lending in the prior year.
banking revenues of $21.2 billion (excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges) decreased 3%, as increases in investment banking and the private bank were more than offset by declines in treasury and trade solutions and corporate lending. investment banking revenues of $5.8 billion increased 11%, reflecting solid growth in capital markets, particularly in equity underwriting. advisory revenues decreased 20% to $1.0 billion, while equity underwriting revenues increased 64% to $1.6 billion and debt underwriting revenues increased 7% to $3.2 billion.
treasury and trade solutions revenues of $9.5 billion declined 7%, and 5% excluding the impact of fx translation, as strong client engagement and growth in deposits were more than offset by lower interest rates and reduced commercial card spend largely driven by the pandemic. private bank revenues of $3.8 billion increased 9%. excluding the impact of gains on loan hedges, private bank revenues of $3.7 billion, increased 8%, driven by increased capital markets activity and improved managed investments revenues, as well as higher lending and deposit volumes, partially offset by lower deposit spreads. corporate lending revenues of $2.1 billion declined 15%. excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, corporate lending revenues of $2.2 billion declined 25%, as higher average loan volumes were more than offset by lower spreads, higher hedging costs and an adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing asset.
markets and securities services revenues of $23.1 billion increased 29%. fixed income markets revenues of $17.3 billion increased 34%, reflecting strength in rates and currencies, spread products and commodities. equity markets revenues of $3.6 billion increased 25%, as solid performance in cash equities and derivatives was partially offset by lower revenues in prime finance. securities services revenues of $2.5 billion decreased 3%, and 1% excluding the impact of fx translation, as higher deposit volumes were more than offset by lower spreads. for additional information on the results of operations of icg in 2020, see "institutional clients group" below.
corporate/other corporate/other net loss was $1.6 billion, compared to net income of $801 million in the prior year, reflecting lower revenues, increased expenses, higher cost of credit, driven by an acl build on citi's residual legacy portfolio under the cecl standard, and lower tax benefits. operating expenses of
$2.5 billion increased significantly, as the wind-down of legacy assets was more than offset by investments in infrastructure, risk management and controls, the civil money penalty and incremental costs associated with the pandemic.
corporate/other revenues of $54 million compared to $2.0 billion in the prior year, reflecting the impact of lower interest rates, episodic gains in the prior year, the wind-down of legacy assets and marks on securities. for additional information on the results of operations of corporate/other in 2020, see "corporate/other" below.
citi's consent order compliance as previously disclosed, citi is embarking on a multiyear transformation, with the target outcome to change citi's business and operating models such that they simultaneously strengthen risk and controls and improve citi's value to customers, clients and shareholders.
one part of the broader transformation effort involves citi's compliance with the federal reserve board and occ consent orders issued with citigroup and citibank, respectively, in october 2020. the consent orders require that citigroup and citibank submit acceptable plans to the federal reserve board and the occ, on various timelines, relating principally to various aspects of risk management, compliance, data quality management and governance, and internal controls. the consent order with the occ also required citibank to pay a $400 million civil money penalty. as a part of its compliance actions, citi has centralized its program management under the leadership of a chief administrative officer organization and is making the strengthening of its risk and control environment a further strategic priority for the company. the citigroup and citibank boards of directors each formed a transformation oversight committee, an ad hoc committee of each board, to provide oversight of management's remediation efforts under the consent orders.
for additional information about the consent orders, see "risk factors-compliance risks" below and citi's current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on october 7, 2020.
covid-19 pandemic overview in addition to the widespread public health implications, the covid-19 pandemic has had an extraordinary impact on macroeconomic conditions in the u.s. and around the world. as discussed below and elsewhere throughout this form 10-k, citi's businesses, results of operations and financial condition have been impacted by economic dislocations and trends caused by the pandemic. citi had builds to its allowance for credit losses (acl) of approximately $9.8 billion during 2020, bringing its total acl to approximately $27.8 billion at december 31, 2020, with an allowance for credit losses on loans (acll) reserve ratio of 3.73% on funded loans. for additional information, see "impact of cecl on citi's allowance for credit losses" below.
despite these impacts, citi has maintained strong capital and liquidity positions with consistently strong business operations. at december 31, 2020, citi had a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 11.7%, a supplementary leverage ratio of 7.0% and a liquidity coverage ratio of 118%, each well above regulatory minimums, with approximately $972 billion of available liquidity resources (see "capital resources" and "managing global risk-liquidity risk" below).
governments and central banks globally have taken a series of aggressive actions to support their economies and mitigate the systemic impacts of the pandemic, and citi continues to proactively assess and utilize these measures where appropriate.
citi's covid-19 pandemic response-supporting colleagues, customers and communities the health and safety of citi's employees and their families, as well as citi's customers, clients and the communities it serves, are of the utmost importance. as the public health crisis has unfolded, citi has continued to take proactive measures to support colleagues' well-being while maintaining its ability to serve customers and clients.
citi colleagues
•the majority of citi colleagues-roughly 80%-around the world are working remotely, however this varies by country.
•citi is pursuing a slow and measured return in locations where local guidelines permit, beginning with only a small number of colleagues.
•citi's response teams continue to consult with health experts and follow local government guidelines in determining the safest return to office for each location.
•citi has reconfigured its sites and implemented new protocols to make work environments as safe as possible in offices, branches and atms.
•citi continues to provide additional health and well-being resources for colleagues, plus enhanced flexibility and paid time off for those impacted by covid-19.
•the company continues to monitor the situation as it evolves and will review and update operations as needed.
citi communities in addition to its business activities, including the consumer relief programs discussed below, citi is supporting those immediately impacted by the pandemic through philanthropic efforts around the world. citi and the citi foundation have committed more than $100 million to date in support of covid-19-related community relief and economic recovery efforts globally. these contributions include over $4 million raised through an employee donation matching program to further global relief efforts. additionally, citi has donated $50 million in proceeds from its participation in the u.s. small business administration's paycheck protection program (ppp) to the citi foundation, which deployed those proceeds to support community development financial institutions (cdfis) across the u.s.
citi consumer loan relief programs as previously disclosed, citi was one of the first banks in the u.s. to announce temporary assistance measures for pandemic-impacted consumer customers. in addition, citi has offered a wide array of short- and medium-term relief programs to customers across regions and products as a result of the pandemic. the relief has primarily been in the form of payment deferrals and fee waivers. these consumer relief programs have mainly been provided to gcb customers, with a small portion reported within corporate/other. to date, citi has provided assistance to approximately three million u.s. consumers and small businesses impacted by the pandemic.
in the fourth quarter of 2020, citi experienced a decline in enrollment of approximately 21% quarter-over-quarter in its formal covid-19 assistance programs. as a result of the significant and steady decline in enrollment, citi ended the programs as of december 31, 2020 for the majority of countries and products. continued covid-19 assistance programs through citi's subservicer include extended mortgage payment deferrals through 2021 and suspended foreclosures into the first quarter of 2021 for u.s. mortgages. citi remains committed to discussing assistance options with customers that continue to experience financial hardship on a case-by-case basis.
the table below provides information on the number of loan modifications, the associated enrollment and outstanding balances as of december 31, 2020, for citi's pandemic-related relief programs, excluding troubled debt restructurings (for additional information, see "troubled debt restructuring (tdr) relief" below).

as set forth in the table above, during the fourth quarter of 2020, citi modified approximately 0.4 million consumer loans, excluding tdrs, with associated enrollment balances of approximately $1.6 billion. for the year ended december 31, 2020, citi modified 5.1 million consumer loans, excluding tdrs, with associated enrollment balances of approximately $25.7 billion. as of december 31, 2020, citi had approximately $3.0 billion of loan balances outstanding under the consumer loan relief programs, representing approximately 1% of citi's total consumer loan balance.
as of december 31, 2020, citi had approximately $2.2 billion of loan balances outstanding under the consumer relief programs in north america.
citi's north america credit card programs had the largest number of loan modifications in 2020. as these credit card relief programs were introduced during the first half of 2020 and offered a deferral of minimum payments for two to four payment cycles, nearly all of the customers had rolled off the programs by year-end, of whom approximately 86% have continued to make payments.
for customers enrolled in mortgage forbearance programs in north america, citi's subservicer offered payment deferrals and suspended foreclosures, and by the end of 2020, approximately 63% of mortgage customers had rolled off the program, of whom approximately 72% have continued to make payments. as of december 31, 2020, citi had approximately $1.3 billion of mortgage loan balances outstanding under the programs.
as of december 31, 2020, citi had approximately $0.8 billion of loan balances outstanding under asia consumer relief programs. in asia, approximately 96% of customers had rolled off the consumer relief programs as of december 31, 2020, of whom approximately 83% have continued to make payments.
as of december 31, 2020, citi had no loan balances outstanding under the latin america consumer relief programs, as all the customers had rolled off the programs, of whom approximately 78% have continued to make payments.
citi corporate loan relief programs citi has modified the contractual terms of corporate loans to certain borrowers impacted by the pandemic, primarily commercial banking (small business) and private bank customers. these modifications consist primarily of deferrals in the payment of principal and/or interest that citi has provided during 2020 in response to borrower requests, as well as those provided pursuant to government-mandated relief programs.
the table below summarizes citi's outstanding active loan modifications, excluding tdrs as of december 31, 2020.

citi's management of covid-19 pandemic risks citi has responded on multiple fronts to the challenges of the pandemic to support the ongoing needs of its customers and clients, while concurrently maintaining safety and soundness standards.
citi's dedicated continuity of business and crisis management groups are managing citi's protocols in response to the pandemic. these protocols provide for the safety and well-being of citi's staff, while continuing to maintain high levels of client servicing across all of the markets in which citi operates. these protocols address the prioritization of critical processing; ability of staff and third parties to support these processes from remote work locations; deployment of new hardware to support technology needs; and ongoing monitoring to assess controls and service levels. planning for citi's return-to-office strategy is ongoing.
citi's organizational response to the pandemic has been governed by citi's executive management team, consisting of the citigroup ceo and certain direct reports of the ceo, and driven through regional task forces that were deployed in asia, emea, north america and latin america. led by regional ceos and their management teams, these groups focused on, and continue to manage, the pandemic responses, implementation of continuity of business plans, locational and staffing strategies and responses to customer and client needs.
throughout the crisis, citi has also worked closely with u.s. authorities and host governments on implementing immediate policy responses and financial assistance structures to mitigate the systemic impacts of the pandemic. citi also continues to engage closely with customers and clients, regulators and other relevant stakeholders to assure alignment on all pandemic-related matters.

certain key government actions in support of the economy u.s. government-sponsored liquidity programs during the first quarter of 2020, the federal reserve board (frb) introduced several liquidity facilities in response to the funding market volatility caused by the pandemic. citi has participated in several of the u.s. government-sponsored liquidity programs, including the money market mutual fund liquidity facility (mmlf), the primary dealer credit facility (pdcf) and discount window (dw) in order to facilitate client activity and support the frb actions to provide additional liquidity into the market. citi has also participated in the paycheck protection program lending facility (ppplf), which was established to facilitate lending under the small business administration's (sba's) paycheck protection program (see "small business administration's paycheck protection program" below). the amounts citi sourced from these facilities were not significant to citi's overall liquidity profile during 2020, which remains strong and highly liquid.
for additional information about citi's liquidity resources, see "managing global risk-liquidity risk" below.
u.s. banking agencies regulatory capital relief in response to the pandemic, throughout 2020, the u.s. banking agencies issued several final rules and interim final rules revising the current regulatory capital standards, to provide banking organizations with additional flexibility to support consumers and businesses. those rules applicable to citi include:
•easing of capital distribution limits in the event of regulatory capital buffer breaches, which provides some flexibility to continue distributing capital under certain circumstances.
•modification of the cecl transition provision to defer the january 1, 2020 capital impact to january 1, 2022 and to provide additional capital relief for ongoing increases in credit reserves. citi's reported common equity tier 1 capital ratio at december 31, 2020, reflecting the modified cecl transition provision, was 39 basis points higher than citi's common equity tier 1 capital ratio, reflecting the full impact of cecl on regulatory capital. excluding the modified cecl transition provision, citigroup's common equity tier 1 capital ratio would have been 11.34%, compared with a 10.0% effective minimum requirement.
•temporary supplementary leverage ratio (slr) relief for bank holding companies, commencing in the second quarter of 2020, allowing citigroup to temporarily expand its balance sheet by excluding u.s. treasury securities and deposits with the frb from the slr denominator. citigroup's reported supplementary leverage ratio of 7.00% benefited by 109 basis points during the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of the temporary relief. excluding the temporary relief, citigroup's supplementary leverage ratio would have been 5.91%, compared with a 5.0% effective minimum requirement.
for additional information about regulatory capital relief provided by the u.s. banking agencies, see "capital resources" below.
troubled debt restructuring (tdr) relief under u.s. gaap, banks are required to assess modifications to a loan's terms for potential classification as a tdr. a loan to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty is classified as a tdr when a lender grants a concession that it would otherwise not consider, such as a payment deferral or interest concession.
in order to encourage banks to work with impacted borrowers, the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act (cares act) and u.s. banking agencies have provided relief from tdr accounting. the main benefits of tdr relief include a capital benefit in the form of reduced risk-weighted assets, as tdrs are more heavily risk-weighted for capital purposes; aging of the loans is frozen, i.e., they will continue to be reported in the same delinquency bucket they were in at the time of modification; and the loans are generally not reported as non-accrual during the modification period. the loans included in citi's pandemic-related consumer relief programs are included in citi's reserving process under the cecl standard.
small business administration's paycheck protection program the paycheck protection program (ppp) authorizes the origination of forgivable loans for small businesses to pay their employees during the pandemic. loan terms are the same for all businesses. during the first round of ppp, which was launched in april 2020, citi funded over 30,000 loans totaling $3.8 billion as of december 31, 2020, with approximately $3.4 billion outstanding at december 31, 2020. the processing of loan forgiveness requests under ppp began during the third quarter of 2020 and citi received approximately $314 million of funds from the sba relating to forgiveness in the fourth quarter of 2020. citi is currently participating in the relaunch of ppp and remains committed to supporting small businesses.
pandemic and other impacts in 2021, citi expects overall revenues to decline from 2020, largely driven by normalization in the icg markets businesses. in addition, gcb, icg and corporate/other revenues will likely continue to be adversely impacted by the lower global interest rate environment, and gcb and icg revenues will be affected by the challenges and uncertainties in the macroeconomic and market environment, including as a result of the continued severity and duration of the pandemic. each gcb region is also expected to continue to experience the adverse impacts the pandemic has had on customer activity, while latin america gcb is also likely to continue to experience an impact from macroeconomic weakness in mexico.
citi also expects to incur higher expenses, as it continues to accelerate the transformation of its infrastructure, risk management and controls, including its efforts to improve the risk and control environment, as well as to comply with the consent orders (see "citi's consent order compliance" above).
moreover, based on its existing portfolios as of december 31, 2020, citi expects to experience higher net credit losses, which will vary by business and region and be dependent on future macroeconomic conditions. citi believes that these losses are adequately reserved for under the cecl standard at december 31, 2020. citi expects international consumer losses to peak during the first half of 2021, while in the u.s., losses could begin to rise in 2021 but peak afterward. if citi's fourth quarter of 2020 macroeconomic forecast assumptions are realized, citi would not expect additional reserve builds on its existing portfolios (for additional information, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates" below); however, the overall level of reserves remains dependent on the evolving economic and public health environments relative to this forecast, as well as new lending volumes.

net income decreased 66%, reflecting lower revenues, higher cost of credit and higher expenses.
retail banking revenues decreased 8%, driven by a decline in loan volumes and lower deposit spreads, partially offset by deposit growth and an increase in assets under management. average deposits were up 10%, while average loans decreased 5%, reflecting the impact of the pandemic on customer activity, as well as the ongoing economic slowdown. assets under management increased 12%, including the benefit of market movements.
cards revenues decreased 10%, primarily driven by lower purchase sales (down 17%) and lower average loans (down 8%), reflecting the impact of the pandemic on customer activity and the ongoing economic slowdown.
expenses increased 4%, as efficiency savings were more than offset by repositioning costs, pandemic-related expenses, and ongoing investment spending.
provisions of $1.3 billion increased 26% from the prior year, driven by a higher allowance for credit losses (acl) build, partially offset by lower net credit losses. net credit losses decreased 14%, primarily driven by lower average loans and the impact of consumer relief programs.

net income decreased 66%, as lower revenues and significantly higher cost of credit were partially offset by lower expenses.
retail banking revenues decreased 3%, as growth in deposits and higher fees on investments and foreign currency transactions due to higher volumes and volatility were more than offset by lower deposit spreads and lower insurance revenues. average deposits increased 11% and average loans increased 5%. assets under management increased 5% and investment sales increased 43%. retail lending revenues increased 4%, largely reflecting growth in mortgages and personal loans, partially offset by spread compression in personal loans.
cards revenues decreased 24%, primarily driven by lower purchase sales (down 16%) and lower average loans (down 8%), reflecting the impact of the pandemic on customer activity, including from lower travel spend in the region given citi's skew to an affluent client base and a greater proportion of fee revenues coming from travel-related interchange and foreign transaction fees.
expenses decreased 1%, as lower discretionary expenses and volume-related costs, as well as efficiency savings, were partially offset by ongoing investment spending.
provisions of $1.3 billion increased 90%, driven by a higher allowance for credit losses (acl) build as well as higher net credit losses. net credit losses increased 16%, as pandemic lockdowns and the deterioration in the macro-environment impacted credit performance.
the acl build of $520 million (compared to a build of $7 million in the prior year under prior accounting standards) was driven by builds during the first three quarters of 2020. the builds reflected the impact of a deterioration in citi's macroeconomic outlook under the cecl standard, including an increase in the qualitative management adjustment to reflect the potential for a higher level of stress and a slower economic recovery, partially offset by lower loan volumes, both primarily driven by the pandemic. for additional information on citi's acl, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates" below and notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements.

institutional clients group institutional clients group (icg) includes banking and markets and securities services (for additional information on these businesses, see "citigroup segments" above). icg provides corporate, institutional, public sector and high-net-worth clients around the world with a full range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, private banking, cash management, trade finance and securities services. icg transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products.
icg revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities. icg earns fee income for assisting clients with transactional services and clearing and providing brokerage and investment banking services and other such activities. such fees are recognized at the point in time when citigroup's performance under the terms of a contractual arrangement is completed, which is typically at the trade/execution date or closing of a transaction. revenue generated from these activities is recorded in commissions and fees and investment banking. revenue is also generated from assets under custody and administration, which is recognized as/when the associated promised service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the point in time the service is requested by the customer and provided by citi. revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in administration and other fiduciary fees. for additional information on these various types of revenues, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
in addition, as a market maker, icg facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. these price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in principal transactions. mark-to-market gains and losses on certain credit derivatives (used to hedge the corporate loan portfolio) are also recorded in principal transactions, (for additional information on principal transactions revenue, see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). other primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (afs) debt securities, gains and losses on equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and losses. interest income earned on assets held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt and to customers on deposits, is recorded as net interest revenue.
the amount and types of markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence and other macroeconomic conditions. assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. however, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product inventory. for example, a decrease in market liquidity may increase bid/offer spreads, decrease client activity levels and widen credit spreads on product inventory positions.
icg's management of the markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of the above factors at the trading desk as well as the country level. icg does not separately track the impact on total markets revenues of the volume of transactions, bid/offer spreads, fair value changes of product inventory positions and economic hedges because, as noted above, these components are interrelated and are not deemed useful or necessary to manage the markets businesses at an aggregate level.
in the markets businesses, client revenues are those revenues directly attributable to client transactions at the time of inception, including commissions, interest or fees earned. client revenues do not include the results of client facilitation activities (e.g., holding product inventory in anticipation of client demand) or the results of certain economic hedging activities.
icg's international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 96 countries and jurisdictions. at december 31, 2020, icg had $1.7 trillion in assets and $924 billion in deposits, while two of its businesses-securities services and issuer services-managed $24.0 trillion and $20.3 trillion in assets under custody as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. for additional information on these operations, see "administration and other fiduciary fees" in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

net income decreased 9%, as higher revenues were more than offset by significantly higher credit costs and higher expenses.
revenues increased 13%, driven by a 29% increase in markets and securities services revenues, partially offset by a 1% decrease in banking revenues (including the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges). excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, banking revenues declined 3%, as growth in investment banking and the private bank was more than offset by a decrease in treasury and trade solutions and corporate lending. excluding the pretax gain of approximately $350 million on citi's investment in tradeweb in the prior year, markets and securities services revenues increased 32%, primarily driven by growth in both fixed income markets and equity markets, partially offset by a decline in securities services.
within banking:
•investment banking revenues were up 11%, reflecting growth in overall market wallet as well as gains in wallet share. advisory revenues decreased 20%, primarily reflecting a decline in the market wallet largely due to the pandemic and a decline in wallet share. equity underwriting revenues increased 64%, reflecting growth in north america, emea and asia, driven by continued strength in the market wallet, reflecting improved market liquidity and investor sentiment as well as wallet share gains. debt underwriting revenues increased 7%, reflecting particular strength in north america, partially offset by latin america, primarily driven by an increase in the second quarter of 2020, as the business assisted clients with sourcing liquidity. the increase in revenues was largely driven by a higher market wallet in investment grade debt underwriting, as well as an increase in overall wallet share.
•treasury and trade solutions revenues decreased 7%. excluding the impact of fx translation, revenues decreased 5%, primarily driven by declines in emea and asia. the decline in revenues was driven by both the cash and trade businesses. in the cash business, the decline in revenues reflected lower interest rates and a slowdown in commercial cards spend driven by the pandemic, partially offset by strong deposit volumes. average deposit balances increased 23% (22% excluding the impact of fx translation), reflecting strong client engagement and solid growth across all regions. in trade, revenues were impacted by a decline in trade fees and trade loans, reflecting a slowdown in underlying trade flows related to the pandemic, partially offset by improved trade spreads.
•corporate lending revenues decreased 15%, including lower losses on loan hedges. excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, revenues decreased 25%, driven by lower loan spreads, an adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing asset and higher hedging costs, partially offset by higher average loan volumes. average loans were up 4%, reflecting higher volumes as the business assisted clients with sourcing liquidity in the evolving environment, primarily in the first half of 2020. end-of-period loans declined 9% in the current year, primarily reflecting repayments, as citi's clients accessed the capital markets, as well as lower loan demand in the second half of 2020, given more muted economic activity.
•private bank revenues increased 9%. excluding the impact of gains on loan hedges, revenues increased 8%, reflecting strength across all regions, driven by continued solid client engagement, in particular in capital markets, higher managed investments revenues and higher loan and deposit volumes, partially offset by lower deposit spreads due to the low interest rate environment.
within markets and securities services:
•fixed income markets revenues increased 34%. excluding the tradeweb gain in the prior year, revenues increased 38%, reflecting strength across all regions, driven by strong client activity in rates and currencies, spread products and commodities, due to the impact of market conditions, including elevated volatility related to the pandemic primarily in the first half of the year, and developments related to vaccines and the u.s. elections in the second half of the year. non-interest revenues increased, reflecting higher corporate and investor activity, given elevated volumes, spreads and volatility, primarily in the first half the year. net interest revenues also increased, largely reflecting a change in the mix of trading positions in support of client activity, as well as lower funding costs.

expenses increased 6%, reflecting investments in infrastructure, risk management and controls, higher compensation costs, operational losses related to certain legal matters and volume-driven growth, partially offset by efficiency savings.
provisions increased to $5.6 billion, driven by net credit losses of $987 million (compared to $394 million in the prior year), and an acl build of $4.6 billion (compared to a modest build in the prior year under prior accounting standards). the increase in net credit losses was largely driven by write-offs across various sectors in both north america and emea, primarily reflecting energy and energy-related exposures. the net credit losses were partially offset by the release of previously established acl reserves.
the increase in the acl build was driven by builds during the first half of 2020. the builds reflected the impact of a deterioration in citi's macroeconomic outlook under the cecl standard, driven by the impact of the pandemic across multiple sectors, as well as downgrades in the corporate portfolios. sectors significantly impacted by the pandemic (including transportation; commercial real estate; energy and energy-related; and consumer retail) drove approximately half of the acl reserve build during 2020. the reserve build also included an increase in the qualitative management adjustment to reflect the potential for a higher level of stress and a slower economic recovery. for additional information on citi's acl accounting, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates" below and notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
as of december 31, 2020, reserves held on citi's balance sheet represented 1.4% of funded loans, compared to 0.7% as of december 31, 2019, including 4.4% of reserves held against the non-investment grade portion.

net loss was $1.6 billion, compared to net income of $801 million in the prior year, largely driven by lower revenues, higher expenses, higher cost of credit and higher tax benefits in the prior year. the higher tax benefits in the prior year were primarily due to higher valuation allowance adjustments on citi's deferred tax assets.
revenues of $54 million decreased $2.0 billion, reflecting the impact of lower interest rates, episodic gains in the prior year, the wind-down of legacy assets and marks on securities.
expenses increased 16%, as the wind-down of legacy assets was more than offset by investments in infrastructure, risk management and controls, the $400 million civil money penalty (for additional information, see "executive summary" and "citi's consent order compliance" above) and incremental costs associated with the pandemic.
provisions increased $253 million to $178 million, primarily driven by acl builds of $199 million on legacy assets (versus a $67 million release in the prior year under prior accounting standards).
the acl build was driven by builds during the first half of 2020 and primarily reflected the impact of a deterioration in citi's macroeconomic outlook under the cecl standard, primarily due to the pandemic. for additional information on citi's acl, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates" below and notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements.

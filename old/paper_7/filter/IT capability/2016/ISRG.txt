item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview open surgery remains the predominant form of surgery and is used in almost every area of the body. however, the large incisions required for open surgery create trauma to patients, typically resulting in longer hospitalization and recovery times, increased hospitalization costs, and additional pain and suffering relative to mis, where mis is available. for over three decades, mis has reduced trauma to patients by allowing selected surgeries to be performed through small ports rather than large incisions. mis has been widely adopted for certain surgical procedures.
da vinci surgical systems enable surgeons to extend the benefits of mis to many patients who would otherwise undergo a more invasive surgery by using computational, robotic and imaging technologies to overcome many of the limitations of conventional mis. surgeons using a da vinci surgical system operate while seated comfortably at a console viewing a 3-d representation of a hd image of the surgical field. this immersive visualization connects surgeons to the surgical field and their instruments. while seated at the console, the surgeon manipulates instrument controls in a natural manner, similar to the open surgery technique. our technology is designed to provide surgeons with a range of motion of mis instruments in the surgical field analogous to the motions of a human wrist, while filtering out the tremor inherent in a surgeon's hand. in designing our products, we focus on making our technology easy and safe to use.
our products fall into four broad categories - the da vinci surgical systems, insite and firefly fluorescence imaging systems ("firefly"), instruments and accessories (e.g., endowrist, endowrist vessel sealer, da vinci single-site and endowrist stapler), and training technologies. we have commercialized four generations of da vinci surgical systems: the first is our da vinci standard surgical system, commercialized in 1999, the second is our da vinci s surgical system, commercialized in 2006, the third is our da vinci si surgical system, commercialized in 2009, and the fourth is our da vinci xi surgical system, commercialized in the second quarter of 2014. these systems include a surgeon's console (or consoles), imaging electronics, a patient-side cart, and computational hardware and software.
we offer over 65 different multiport da vinci instruments enabling surgeons' flexibility in choosing the types of tools needed in a particular surgery. these multiport instruments are generally robotically controlled versions of surgical tools that surgeons would use in either open or laparoscopic surgery. we offer advanced instrumentation for the da vinci si and da vinci xi platforms, including the endowrist vessel sealer and endowrist stapler products, to provide surgeons with sophisticated, computer-aided tools to precisely and efficiently interact with tissue. we offer our single-site instruments for use with the da vinci si and da vinci xi surgical systems in cholecystectomy, benign hysterectomy, and salpingo-oophorectomy procedures. single-site instruments enable surgeons to also perform surgery through a single port via the patient's belly button, resulting in the potential for virtually scarless results.
training technologies include our da vinci skills simulator, da vinci connect remote case observation and mentoring tool, and our dual console for use in surgeon proctoring and collaborative surgery.
procedures we model patient value as equal to procedure efficacy / invasiveness. in this equation procedure efficacy is defined as a measure of the success of the surgery in resolving the underlying disease and invasiveness is defined as a measure of patient pain and disruption of regular activities. when the patient value of a da vinci procedure is greater than that of alternative treatment options, patients may benefit from seeking out surgeons and hospitals that offer da vinci surgery, which could potentially result in a local market share shift. da vinci procedure adoption occurs procedure by procedure, market by market, and is driven by the relative patient value and total treatment costs of da vinci procedures as compared to alternative treatment options for the same disease state or condition.
worldwide procedures da vinci systems and instruments are regulated independently in various countries and regions of the world. the discussion of indications for use and representative or target procedures is intended solely to provide an understanding of the market for da vinci products and is not intended to promote for sale or use any intuitive surgical product outside of its licensed or cleared labeling and indications for use.
the adoption of da vinci surgery has the potential to grow for those procedures that offer greater patient value than non-da vinci alternatives, within the prevailing economics of healthcare providers. da vinci surgical systems are used primarily in gynecologic surgery, general surgery, urologic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and head and neck surgery. we focus our organization and investments on developing, marketing, and training for those products and targeted procedures where da vinci can bring patient value relative to alternative treatment options and/or economic benefit to healthcare providers. target procedures in gynecology include da vinci hysterectomy ("dvh"), for both cancer and benign conditions, and sacrocolpopexy. target procedures in general surgery include hernia repair (both ventral and inguinal), colorectal procedures, and cholecystectomy. target procedures in urology
include da vinci prostatectomy ("dvp") and partial nephrectomy. in cardiothoracic surgery, target procedures include da vinci lobectomy and da vinci mitral valve repair. in head and neck surgery, target procedures include certain procedures resecting benign and malignant tumors classified as t1 and t2. not all the indications, procedures, or products described may be available in a given country or region or on all generations of da vinci surgical systems. patients need to consult the product labeling in their specific country and for each product in order to determine the actual authorized uses, as well as important limitations, restrictions, or contraindications.
in 2016, approximately 753,000 surgical procedures were performed with the da vinci surgical system, compared with approximately 652,000 and 570,000 procedures performed in 2015 and 2014, respectively. the growth in our overall procedure volume in 2016 was driven by growth in u.s. general surgery procedures and worldwide urologic procedures.
u.s. procedures overall u.s. procedure volume grew to approximately 563,000 in 2016, compared with approximately 499,000 in 2015, and approximately 449,000 in 2014. gynecology is our largest u.s. surgical specialty and the procedure volume was approximately 246,000 in 2016, compared with 238,000 in 2015 and 235,000 in 2014. general surgery is our second largest and fastest growing specialty in the u.s. with procedure volume that grew to approximately 186,000 in 2016, compared with approximately 140,000 in 2015 and 107,000 in 2014. u.s. urology procedure volume was approximately 109,000 in 2016, compared with approximately 102,000 in 2015, and 91,000 in 2014.
overall ous procedures grew to approximately 190,000 in 2016, compared with approximately 153,000 in 2015 and approximately 121,000 in 2014. procedure growth in most ous markets was driven largely by urology procedure volume. dvp procedure volume grew to approximately 92,000 in 2016, compared with approximately 79,000 in 2015, and approximately 65,000 in 2014. partial nephrectomy, general surgery, and gynecologic oncology procedures also contributed to ous procedure growth.
see "recent business events and trends" for further discussion on u.s. and ous procedures.
business model overview we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da vinci surgical systems and from subsequent sales of instruments, accessories and service, as recurring revenue. the da vinci surgical system generally sells for approximately between $0.6 million and $2.5 million, depending upon the model, configuration and geography, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers. we generate recurring revenue as our customers purchase our endowrist and single-site instrument and accessory products used in performing procedures with the da vinci surgical system. our instruments and accessories have a limited life and will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery, at which point they need to be replaced. we typically enter into service contracts at the time systems are sold at an annual rate of approximately $80,000 to $170,000, depending upon the configuration of the underlying system and composition of the services offered under the contract. these service contracts have generally been renewed at the end of the initial contractual service periods.
recurring revenue recurring revenue has generally grown at a faster rate than system revenue in the last few fiscal years. recurring revenue increased to $1.9 billion, or 71% of total revenue in 2016, compared with $1.7 billion, or 70% of total revenue in 2015 and $1.5 billion, or 70% of total revenue in 2014. the growth of recurring revenue and its increasing proportion of total revenue largely reflect continued procedure adoption on a growing base of installed da vinci surgical systems. the installed base of da vinci surgical systems has grown to approximately 3,919 at december 31, 2016, compared with 3,597 at december 31, 2015, and 3,266 at december 31, 2014.
procedure mix / products our procedure business is primarily comprised of: (1) cancer and other highly complex procedures and (2) less complex procedures for benign conditions. cancer and other highly complex procedures tend to be reimbursed at higher rates than less complex procedures for benign conditions. thus, hospitals are more sensitive to the costs associated with treating less complex benign conditions. our strategy is to provide hospitals with attractive clinical and economic solutions in each of these procedure categories. our fully featured da vinci xi system with advanced instruments including the endowrist vessel sealer, endowrist stapler products, and our table motion product target the more complex procedure segment. lower priced products, including the three-arm da vinci si-e system, refurbished da vinci si, and single-site instruments, are targeted towards less complex procedures.
procedure seasonality more than half of da vinci procedures performed are for benign conditions, most notably benign hysterectomies, hernia repairs, and cholecystectomies. the proportion of these procedures for benign conditions has grown over time in relation to the total number of procedures performed. hysterectomies for benign conditions, hernia repairs, cholecystectomies, and other short-term elective procedures tend to be more seasonal than cancer operations and surgeries for other life threatening conditions. seasonality in the u.s. for these procedures for benign conditions typically results in higher fourth quarter procedure volume when more patients have met annual deductibles and lower first quarter procedure volume when deductibles are reset. seasonality outside the u.s. varies but is often more pronounced around local holidays and vacation periods.
distribution channels we provide our products through direct sales organizations in the u.s., japan, south korea, and europe, excluding spain, portugal, italy, greece, and eastern european countries. in the remainder of our ous markets, we provide our products through distributors.
intuitive surgical da vinci system leasing since 2013, we have entered into sales-type and operating lease arrangements directly with certain qualified customers as a way to offer customers flexibility in how they acquire da vinci systems and expand da vinci surgery availability while leveraging our balance sheet. the leases generally have commercially competitive terms as compared with other third party entities that offer equipment leasing. we include both operating and sales-type leases in our system shipment and installed base disclosures. we exclude operating leases from our system average selling price computations.
in the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we shipped 95, 63, and 41 systems under lease arrangements, respectively, of which 62, 43, and 14 were classified as operating leases, respectively. generally, the operating lease arrangements provide our customers with the right to purchase the leased system sometime during or at the end of the lease term. revenue generated from customer purchases of systems under operating lease arrangements ("lease buyouts") was $38.2 million, $9.4 million, and $0 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. we expect that revenue recognized from customer exercises of the buyout options will fluctuate based on the timing of when, and if, customers choose to exercise their buyout options. operating lease revenue for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, was $16.6 million, $7.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2016, 79 da vinci systems were installed at customers under operating lease arrangements. we believe our leasing program has been an effective and well-received, and we are willing to expand it based on customer demand.
regulatory activities clearances and approvals we have obtained the clearances required to market our multiport products associated with all generations of our da vinci surgical systems (standard, s, si, and xi systems) for our targeted surgical specialties within the u.s. and most of the european markets in which we operate.
in march 2014, we received fda clearance to market our da vinci xi surgical system in the u.s., our fourth generation da vinci surgical system (see the description of the da vinci xi surgical system in the new product introductions section below). in june 2014, we received ce mark clearance for our da vinci xi surgical system in europe. we received regulatory clearances for the da vinci xi surgical system in south korea in october 2014 and in japan in march 2015. the regulatory status of the da vinci xi surgical system in other ous markets varies by country.
we also received fda clearance on an initial set of instruments for the xi surgical system in early 2014.  later in 2014, we received fda clearances for xi versions of our endowrist vessel sealer, firefly, and endowrist stapler 45. in september 2014, we received fda clearance to market the wristed version of our single-site needle driver product for use on benign hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and salpingo oophorectomy procedures. in the second quarter of 2015, we received fda clearance for an additional set of da vinci xi instruments. in april 2015, we received ce mark status to sell the endowrist stapler for the si and xi surgical systems in european markets. in june 2015, we received ce mark clearance in europe and in january 2016 we received u.s. fda clearance for our integrated table motion product. in march 2016, we received fda 510(k) clearances in the u.s. for single-site instruments and the 30mm endowrist stapler products for the da vinci xi surgical system (see the description of the endowrist stapler 30 in the new product introductions section below). in march 2016, we also received ce mark clearances in europe for single-site instruments and the 30mm endowrist stapler products for the da vinci xi surgical system.
in april 2014, we received fda clearance to market our da vinci single port surgical system in the u.s. for single-port urologic surgeries. at the time, we decided not to market that version of the da vinci single port surgical system. we instead elected to pursue the necessary modifications to integrate it into the da vinci xi product family as a dedicated single port patient console compatible with the existing da vinci xi surgeon console, vision cart, and other equipment. we have since completed
these modifications and have begun clinical evaluations of the product. we plan to seek fda clearance(s) for this da vinci xi version of the da vinci single port surgical system for procedure(s) in which a single small entry point to the body and parallel delivery of instruments is important. such surgeries could include those performed through a natural orifice like the mouth for head and neck procedures or those performed through a single skin incision. we do not anticipate material revenue contribution from the da vinci single port surgical system in 2017.
we obtained approval from the japanese ministry of health, labor, and welfare ("mhlw") for our da vinci xi surgical system in march 2015. national reimbursement status was received for dvp procedures in japan effective april 2012 and for da vinci partial nephrectomy procedures in april 2016. with our support, japanese surgical societies are seeking reimbursement for additional procedures through the mhlw's senshin iryo processes as well as alternative reimbursement processes. senshin iryo approvals require in-country clinical data and are considered in april of even numbered years. there can be no assurance that we will gain additional reimbursements for the procedures or at the times we have targeted. if we are not successful in obtaining additional regulatory clearances, importation licenses, and adequate procedure reimbursements for future products and procedures, then the demand for our products in japan could be limited.
recalls and corrections medical device companies have regulatory obligations to correct or remove medical devices in the field that could pose a risk to health. the definition of "recalls and corrections" is expansive and includes repair, replacement, inspections, re-labeling, and issuance of new or additional instructions for use or reinforcement of existing instructions for use and training when such actions are taken for specific reasons of safety or compliance. these field actions require stringent documentation, reporting, and monitoring worldwide. there are other actions which a medical device manufacturer may take in the field without reporting, including routine servicing, the introduction of new products and new indications for use, and stock rotations.
as we determine whether a field action is reportable in any regulatory jurisdiction, we prepare and submit notifications to the appropriate regulatory agency for the particular jurisdiction. regulators can require the expansion, reclassification, or change in scope and language of the field action. in general, upon submitting required notifications to regulators regarding a field action which is a recall or correction, we will notify customers regarding the field action, provide any additional documentation required in their national language, and arrange, as required, return or replacement of the affected product or a field service visit to perform the correction.
field actions as well as certain outcomes from regulatory activities can result in adverse effects on our business, including damage to our reputation, delays by customers of purchase decisions, reduction or stoppage of the use of installed systems, and reduced revenue as well as increased expenses.
recent business events and trends procedures overall. during the year ended december 31, 2016, total da vinci procedures grew approximately 15% compared with 14% for the year ended december 31, 2015. u.s. procedure growth during the year ended december 31, 2016 was approximately 13%, compared with approximately 11% for the year ended december 31, 2015. the higher 2016 u.s. procedure growth was largely attributable to growth in general surgery procedures, most notably hernia repair and colorectal procedures, as well as moderate growth in more mature gynecologic and urologic procedure categories.
procedure volume ous for the year ended december 31, 2016, grew approximately 24% compared with approximately 26% growth for the year ended december 31, 2015, driven by continued growth in dvp procedures and earlier stage growth in kidney cancer procedures. we believe growth in these global markets is being driven by increased acceptance among surgeons and health systems, supported by expanded global evidence validating the clinical and economic value of dvp.
the 2016 ous procedure growth rate reflects continued da vinci adoption in european and asian markets. growth was strong in asia and variable by country in europe. we experienced strong procedure growth in china as systems sold under a previous public hospital quota system have been installed. however, procedure adoption in china, future system placements and our ability to sustain procedure growth are dependent on obtaining additional importation authorizations and hospitals completing a central purchasing tender process under the authorization. the most recent authorization expired at the end of 2015. the timing and magnitude of future authorizations, which may enable future system placements, is not certain. in japan, procedure growth rates are likely to be paced by the timing of procedure reimbursement approvals for procedures in addition to dvp and partial nephrectomy. we also experienced strong procedure growth in japan since receiving the national reimbursements, outlined above, for dvp and partial nephrectomy. however, as adoption for these procedures has progressed, procedure growth in japan is slowing.
u.s. gynecology. gynecology is our largest u.s. surgical specialty and the procedure volume was approximately 246,000 in 2016, compared with 238,000 in 2015 and 235,000 in 2014. we believe that overall u.s. gynecologic surgery volume for benign conditions (robotic and other modalities) has been pressured in recent years by factors including, but not limited to, a trend by payers toward encouraging conservative disease management, trends towards higher patient deductibles and co-pays, and fda actions regarding the use of power morcellation in uterine surgeries. combining robotic, laparoscopic, and vaginal approaches, mis represents about 80% of the u.s. hysterectomy market for benign conditions, and thus the rate of migration from open surgeries to mis has slowed. we believe that our modest growth in dvh procedures in 2015 and 2016 was driven by an increasing proportion of dvh procedures consolidating to gynecologic oncologists, a group of surgeons more aligned with da vinci surgical system utilization. total u.s. dvh procedure volume was approximately 204,000, 196,000, and 191,000 in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
u.s. general surgery. general surgery is our second largest and fastest growing specialty in the u.s. with procedure volume that grew to approximately 186,000 in 2016, compared with approximately 140,000 in 2015, and 107,000 in 2014. ventral and inguinal hernia, combined, contributed to the most incremental growth in u.s. general surgery procedures in 2015 and 2016. we believe that growth in da vinci hernia repair reflects improved clinical outcomes within certain patient populations, as well as potential cost benefits relative to certain alternative treatments. we believe hernia repair procedures represent a significant opportunity with the potential to drive growth in future periods, however, given the differences in complexity among hernia patient populations and varying surgeon opinion regarding optimal surgical technique, it is difficult to estimate the timing of and to what extent da vinci hernia repair procedure volume will grow in the future. we expect a large portion of hernia repairs will continue to be performed via different modalities of surgery.
adoption of da vinci for colorectal procedures, which includes several underlying procedures including low anterior resections for rectal cancers and certain colon procedures for benign and cancerous conditions, has been ongoing for several years, and is supported by our recently launched technologies such as the da vinci xi surgical system, endowrist stapler, endowrist vessel sealer, and integrated table motion.
dvp. u.s. dvp is the largest urology procedure in the u.s. with 70,000 dvps performed in 2016, compared with 66,000 in 2015, and 60,000 in 2014.
we believe the return to growth in u.s. dvp in 2014 and our subsequent growth rate reflects surgical procedures being performed for men who may have previously deferred screening or definitive treatment. we believe that our lower 2016 growth rate reflects surgical volumes coming into closer alignment with new diagnoses of prostate cancer. as the u.s. standard of care for the surgical treatment of prostate cancer, we expect that the number of dvp procedures performed in the u.s. will fluctuate with the overall prostatectomy market. dvp is the largest overall ous procedure with approximately 92,000 performed in 2016, compared with 79,000 in 2015, and 65,000 in 2014. dvp is at various stages of adoption in different areas of the world.
system demand future demand for da vinci surgical systems will be impacted by factors including hospital response to the evolving health care environment under the new u.s. administration, procedure growth rates, hospital consolidation trends, evolving system utilization and point of care dynamics, capital replacement trends, additional reimbursements in various global markets including japan, the timing around governmental tenders and authorizations, including china, and the timing of when we receive regulatory clearance in our other ous markets for our xi system and related instruments. demand may also be impacted by robotic surgery competition, including from companies that have introduced products in the field of robotic surgery or have made explicit statements about their efforts to enter the field, including but not limited to: auris surgical robotics, inc.; avatera medical gmbh; cambridge medical robotics ltd.; johnson & johnson and google inc. and their joint venture, verb surgical inc.; medicaroid inc.; medrobotics corp.; meerecompany inc.; medtronic plc.; olympus corp.; samsung corporation; smart robot technology group co. ltd.; titan medical, inc.; and transenterix, inc., as well as other economic and geopolitical factors.
new product introductions da vinci xi surgical system. during april 2014, we launched our newest da vinci model, the da vinci xi, in the u.s. the da vinci xi can be used across a wide spectrum of mis procedures, and has been optimized for multi-quadrant surgeries. the da vinci xi expands upon core da vinci features including wristed instruments, 3-d hd visualization, intuitive motion, and ergonomic design, while improving ease of use, and delivering several new features, including:
•   a new overhead instrument arm architecture designed to facilitate anatomical access from virtually any position.
•   a new digital endoscope architecture that creates a simpler, more compact design with improved vision definition and clarity.
•   an ability to attach the endoscope to any arm, providing flexibility for visualizing the surgical site.
•   smaller, thinner arms with newly designed joints that offer a greater range of motion than before.
•   ease of use enhancements, including automated pre-surgical deployment of the da vinci robot arms.
with the da vinci xi, we now offer hospitals a broader line of da vinci surgical systems to match their surgical profile and patient care requirements. these include the da vinci si-e, a lower price system suited for surgeries requiring two instrument arms; the da vinci si, which has the capability of controlling three instrument arms; and the da vinci xi, which has four universal instrument arms that attach to a rotating overhead platform. we separately applied for fda clearance for the da vinci xi firefly, vessel sealer, and stapler 45 products and received clearances for these products in 2014. see the clearances and approvals section above for more information on regulatory clearances of the da vinci xi platform products.
da vinci xi integrated table motion. integrated table motion coordinates the movements of the da vinci robot arms with an advanced operating room table, the trusystem® 7000dv sold by trumpf medicaltm, to enable shifting a patient's position in real-time while the da vinci surgical robotic arms remain docked. this gives operating room teams the capabilities to optimally position the operating table so that gravity exposes anatomy during multi-quadrant da vinci system procedures, maximize reach and access to target anatomy enabling surgeons to interact with tissue at an ideal working angle, and reposition the table during the procedure to enhance anesthesiologists' care of the patient.
endowrist stapler 45. in october 2012, we received fda clearance for the endowrist stapler 45 instrument with blue and green 45mm reloads for use with the da vinci si surgical system. the endowrist stapler 45 is a wristed, stapling instrument intended for resection, transection and/or creation of anastomoses in general, gynecologic, and urologic surgery. this instrument enables operators to precisely position and fire the stapler. its initial surgical use was directed towards colorectal procedures. in january 2015, we began to ship initial da vinci xi versions of the endowrist stapler 45, including blue, green, and white 45 mm reloads. the white reloads are only available on the da vinci xi platform.
endowrist stapler 30. in march 2016, we received  fda clearance in the u.s. for the endowrist stapler 30 instrument with blue, green, white, and gray 30mm reloads for use with the da vinci xi surgical system. it is intended to deliver particular utility with fine tissue interaction in lobectomy and other thoracic procedures. the endowrist stapler 30 is a wristed, stapling instrument intended for resection, transection and/or creation of anastomoses.
intuitive surgical-fosun medical technology (shanghai) co., ltd.
in september 2016, we agreed to establish a joint venture with shanghai fosun pharmaceutical (group) co., ltd. "fosun pharma", a subsidiary of fosun international limited, to research, develop, manufacture, and sell robotic-assisted catheter-based medical devices. the joint venture will initially produce products targeting early diagnosis and cost-effective treatment of lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in the world. the technology will be used in robotic-assisted medical devices based on catheters and incorporates proprietary intellectual property developed or owned by us. the joint venture will be

total revenue total revenue was $2.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016, and increased by 13% compared with $2.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015. total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015, increased by 12% compared with $2.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase in total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2016, reflects 15% higher recurring revenue driven by approximately 15% higher procedure volume, and 10% higher systems revenue. the increase in total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015, reflects 14% higher systems revenue and 11% higher recurring revenue driven by approximately 14% higher procedure volume.
we sell our products and services in euros and british pounds in those european markets where we have direct distribution channels, and in japanese yen and korean won in japan and south korea, respectively. foreign currency did not have a material impact on total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2016, as compared with 2015. revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015, as compared with 2014, was negatively impacted by the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against these other currencies. we hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated revenue and those hedges partially offset the negative impact of the strengthened u.s. dollar on revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015. revenue denominated in foreign currencies was approximately 19%, 19%, and 16% of total revenue for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. the u.s. dollar generally has strengthened against the other currencies that we transaction our sales in during latter half of 2016. if the u.s. dollar continues to remain as strong or strengthens further against the other currencies we transact our sales in, and we are not able to adjust our foreign currency denominated pricing, our revenue may be negatively impacted in 2017.
revenue generated in the u.s. accounted for 72%, 71%, and 70% of total revenue during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. we believe that u.s. revenue has accounted for the large majority of total revenue due to patients' ability to choose their provider and method of treatment in the u.s., reimbursement structures supportive of innovation and minimally invasive surgery, and initial investments focused on u.s. infrastructure. we have been investing in our business in the ous market and our ous procedures have grown faster in proportion to u.s. procedures. we expect that our ous procedures and revenue will make up a greater portion of our business in the long term.

product revenue increased by 14% to $2.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared with $1.9 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015.
instrument and accessory revenue increased by 17% to $1.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared with $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase in instrument and accessory revenue was driven by procedure growth of approximately 15% and higher sales of our advanced instruments, partially offset by customer buying patterns. 2016 u.s. procedure growth was approximately 13% compared with 11% in 2015 and was largely attributable to growth in general
surgery procedures, most notably hernia repair and colorectal procedures, as well as moderate growth in more mature gynecologic and urologic procedure categories. ous procedure growth was approximately 24% for 2016, compared with 26% for 2015, driven by continued growth in dvp and earlier stage growth in kidney cancer procedures.
systems revenue increased by 10% to $791.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared with $721.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. higher systems revenue was driven by higher system shipments, higher number of lease buyouts, and higher revenue from our integrated table motion product. revenue from lease buyouts was $38.2 million for year ended december 31, 2016, compared with $9.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. we expect revenue from lease buyouts to fluctuate period to period based on the timing of when, and if, customers choose to exercise the buyout options embedded in their leases.
during 2016, a total of 537 systems were shipped compared with 492 systems in 2015. by geography, 338 systems were shipped into the u.s., 96 into asia, 79 into europe, and 24 into other markets, compared with 298 systems shipped into the u.s., 77 into asia, 90 into europe, and 27 into other markets in 2015. during 2016, 62 of the 537 systems were shipped under operating lease arrangements compared with 43 of 492 systems shipped during 2015. operating lease revenue was $16.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared with $7.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase in systems shipments was primarily driven by procedure growth in 2016.
the da vinci surgical system average selling price ("asp"), excluding the impact of systems shipped under operating leases, was approximately $1.52 million and $1.54 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. asps fluctuate period to period based on geographic and product mix, product pricing, systems shipped involving trade-ins, and changes in foreign exchange rates.
instrument and accessory revenue increased by 12% to $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared with $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase in instrument and accessory revenue was driven by an approximate 14% increase in procedure volume, reflecting approximately 11% u.s. procedure growth and 26% ous procedure growth as well as a higher product mix of advanced instruments, partially offset by an unfavorable impact of weakening foreign currencies.
systems revenue increased by 14% to $721.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2015, compared with $632.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2014, driven by higher da vinci surgical systems shipped in 2015. we shipped 492 da vinci surgical systems in 2015, compared with 431 in 2014, primarily reflecting higher system sales into the u.s. during 2015, 298 systems were shipped into the u.s., 90 into europe, 77 into asia, and 27 into other markets, compared with 238 systems shipped into the u.s., 97 into europe, 67 into asia, and 29 into other markets in 2014. the increase in u.s. systems sales was driven by higher procedure growth in 2015 and a favorable market response to the da vinci xi system that was launched in the second quarter of 2014.
the da vinci surgical system asp, excluding the impact of systems shipped under operating leases, was approximately $1.54 million and $1.50 million for 2015 and 2014. the systems asp reflected a higher proportion of da vinci xi and dual console systems sold in 2015, partially offset by the negative impact of weaker foreign currencies.
service revenue service revenue increased by 11% to $517.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared with $464.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. service revenue increased by 8% to $464.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared with $429.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. higher service revenue in 2016 and 2015 was primarily driven by a larger installed base of da vinci surgical systems producing service revenue.
gross profit product gross profit increased by 20% for the year ended december 31, 2016, to $1.5 billion, representing 69.7% of product revenue, compared with $1.3 billion, representing 66.3% of product revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2015. the higher 2016 product gross profit was primarily driven by higher product revenue and higher gross profit margin.
the higher product gross profit margin for the year ended december 31, 2016, as compared with the year ended december 31, 2015, was driven by product cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies on our da vinci xi system and other newer products, the mdet impact described below, and favorable product mix, including higher sales of our da vinci xi integrated table motion product.
in september 2016 the internal revenue service approved a $7.1 million refund claim that we submitted in connection with mdet filings for the periods from the first quarter of 2013 to the third quarter of 2014. product gross profit included a $7.1 million benefit related to the mdet refund for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared with $17.0 million expense for the year
product gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2015, increased by 12% to $1.3 billion, or 66.3% of product revenue, compared with $1.1 billion, or 66.5% of product revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2014. the lower 2015 product gross profit margin was driven by a higher sales mix of recently introduced products that yield lower gross profit margins, including the da vinci xi surgical system and endowrist one vessel sealer and stapler, and an unfavorable foreign currency impact related to ous sales.
margins on newly launched products will typically be lower than that of our more mature products reflecting vendor pricing on lower volumes and temporary tooling costs. over time, as volumes increase and we refine our manufacturing processes and products, we expect to see improvement in the margins of these newly launched products as realized and described above in the 2016 results. however, gross margins may ultimately differ for these newly launched products relative to previously launched products based on market conditions, volume, and complexity of the product.
product gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, included share-based compensation expense of $25.2 million, $22.8 million, and $19.1 million, respectively. product gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 included amortization expense of intangible assets of $7.8 million, $12.7 million, and $10.8 million, respectively.
service gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2016, increased to $366.0 million, or 70.8% of service revenue, compared with $305.5 million, or 65.7% of service revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015. the higher 2016 service gross profit was driven by higher service revenue, reflecting a larger installed base of da vinci surgical systems, and higher service gross profit margin. the higher service gross profit margin for the year ended december 31, 2016, as compared with the year ended december 31, 2015, was primarily driven by improved efficiency and gains made in servicing the da vinci xi surgical system. during the year ended december 31, 2016, particularly during the second quarter, we were generally able to utilize lower cost refurbished endoscopes to meet customer service and replacement needs. our ability to utilize lower cost refurbished endoscopes to meet service needs may vary period to period. as our installed base of da vinci xi surgical system increases, we will need to expand our service pool with new endoscopes, which is expected to result in higher field replacement costs.
service gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2015, increased to $305.5 million, or 65.7% of service revenue, compared with $281.0 million, or 65.5% of service revenue for the year ended december 31, 2014. the higher 2015 service gross profit was driven by higher service revenue, reflecting a larger installed base of da vinci surgical systems.
service gross profit for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, included share-based compensation expense of $12.4 million, $12.9 million and $13.5 million, respectively.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, sales and marketing activities, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees and general corporate expenses.
selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016, increased by 10% to $705.3 million, compared with $640.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily due to higher ous expenses associated with our expanded asian and european teams, infrastructure, higher headcount, and higher legal fees. selling, general and administrative expenses also included pre-tax litigation charges of $12.1 million and $13.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, and 2015 respectively.
selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015, decreased by 7% to $640.5 million compared with $691.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease was primarily due to lower pre-tax litigation charges of $13.2 million in 2015, compared with $82.4 million in 2014, and to a lesser extent, the impact of the stronger u.s. dollar on expenses denominated in foreign currencies. these decreases were partially offset by increased costs associated with the expansion of our japanese and other organizations ous, as well as higher regulatory compliance costs and higher incentive compensation costs.
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred. research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing and significant enhancement of our products.
research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016, increased by 21% to $239.6 million, compared with $197.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily due to higher personnel and other project costs to support a broader set of product development initiatives, including additional da vinci xi platform products, our da vinci
single port surgical system, robotic-assisted catheter-based medical devices, advanced imaging and analytics, advanced instrumentation, and next generation robotics.
research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015, increased by 11% to $197.4 million compared with $178.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was driven primarily by growth in our product development organization, including development in advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation, and next generation robotics, and higher incentive compensation costs.
share-based compensation expense charged to research and development expense during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, was $43.0 million, $37.7 million and $37.5 million, respectively. amortization expense related to intangible assets for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, was $10.4 million, $11.7 million and $11.6 million, respectively.
research and development expenses fluctuate with project timing. based upon our broader set of product development initiative and the stage of the underlying projects, we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future.
operating expenses we plan to make substantial investments in several strategic areas to advance several key product development innovations in research, development, and clinical investment into 2017. we anticipate that we will invest up to $80 million more in 2017 in these areas than our typical growth rate.
interest and other income, net interest and other income, net, was $35.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared with $18.5 million for 2015 and $4.2 million for 2014. the increase in interest and other income, net for the year ended december 31, 2016, was primarily driven by higher interest earned during the year ended december 31, 2016, on higher cash and investment balances. the increase in interest and other income, net for the year ended december 31, 2015, was partly due to higher 2015 interest income as compared with 2014 and the $8.5 million impairment charges recorded in 2014 related to two equity investments.
income tax expense our income tax expense was $244.9 million, $169.7 million, and $130.2 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. the effective tax rate for 2016 was approximately 25.0% compared with 22.4% for 2015, and 23.7% for 2014. our tax rates for these periods differ from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the effect of income earned by certain of our overseas entities being taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate and reversal of certain unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by state income taxes net of federal benefit. we intend to indefinitely reinvest outside the u.s. all of our undistributed foreign earnings that were not previously subject to u.s. tax.
our 2016, 2015, and 2014 tax provision reflected tax benefits of $15.8 million, $6.4 million, and $20.3 million, respectively, associated with the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits and interests resulting from expiration of statutes of limitations in multiple jurisdictions and certain audit settlements. our 2015 tax provision also reflected a $29.3 million tax benefit resulting from a recent u.s. tax court opinion involving an independent third party, issued in the third quarter of 2015. based on the findings of the u.s. tax court, we were required to, and did, refund to our foreign subsidiaries the share-based compensation element of certain intercompany charges made in prior periods. starting from 2015, share-based compensation has been excluded from intercompany charges.
we file federal, state, and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the u.s. and abroad. years prior to 2013 are considered closed for most significant jurisdictions. certain of our unrecognized tax benefits could reverse based on the normal expiration of various statutes of limitations, which could affect our effective tax rate in the period in which they reverse.
we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities and the outcome of these audits cannot be predicted with certainty. management regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. if any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and issuance of common stock through exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase program. cash and cash equivalents plus short and long-term investments increased by $1.5 billion to $4.8 billion at december 31, 2016, from $3.3 billion at december 31, 2015, and $2.5 billion at december 31, 2014. cash generation is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting our operating, investing, and financing needs.
on january 27, 2017, we made a payment of $2.0 billion related to an accelerated share repurchase program that we entered into with goldman, sachs & co. to repurchase our common stock. we made that payment using part of our cash and investments held in the u.s. at december 31, 2016. for further details of the accelerated share repurchased program, see "note 8. stockholders' equity" to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data".
as of december 31, 2016, $1,309.5 million of our cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to u.s. income tax on repatriation to the u.s. we currently have no plans to repatriate any foreign earnings back to the u.s. our intent is to reinvest these funds outside of the u.s. indefinitely, and we believe our cash flows provided by our u.s. operations will meet our u.s. liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.
see "item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for discussion on the impact of interest rate risk and market risk on our investment portfolio.

operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2016, cash provided by our operating activities of $1,042.9 million exceeded our net income of $735.9 million primarily due certain to non-cash charges as outlined below:
1.   our net income included non-cash charges including in the form of share-based compensation of $177.6 million; depreciation and loss of disposal of property, plant, and equipment of $73.9 million; investment related non-cash charges of $35.9 million; deferred income tax of $18.7 million; amortization of intangible assets of $18.2 million; partly offset by tax benefits from employee stock plans of $14.3 million.
2.   the non-cash charges outlined above were partly offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in $3.0 million of cash used by operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2016. operating assets and liabilities are primarily comprised of accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses, deferred revenue, and other accrued liabilities. inventory, including the transfer of equipment from inventory to property, plant and equipment, increased by $46.7 million. accounts receivable increased $35.9 million primarily driven by higher revenue and timing of collections. prepaids and other assets increased $28.7 million primarily driven by higher lease receivable balances resulting from sales-type lease arrangement transactions entered into during year ended december 31, 2016. the unfavorable impact of these items on cash provided by operating activities was partly offset by a $53.8 million increase in other liabilities, primarily due to higher income tax payable, a $19.9 million increase in deferred revenue, an $18.7 million increase in accrued compensation and employee benefits, and a $15.9 million increase in accounts payable. deferred revenue, which includes deferred service revenue that is being recognized as revenue over the service contract period, increased primarily due to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts existed.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, cash provided by our operating activities of $771.9 million exceeded our net income of $588.8 million for two primary reasons:
1.   our net income included non-cash charges primarily in the form of share-based compensation of $167.9 million, depreciation and loss of disposal of property, plant, and equipment of $65.1 million, income tax benefits from employee
stock plans of $21.5 million, amortization of intangible assets of $24.4 million, and accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on investments of $26.4 million.
2.   the non-cash charges outlined above were partly offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in $92.5 million of cash used by operating activities.
operating assets and liabilities are primarily comprised of accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue, other accrued liabilities, and prepaid expenses. accounts receivable increased $79.2 million in 2015 reflecting higher sales in 2015 and timing of sales and collections. prepaids and other assets increased $10.5 million primarily driven by higher lease receivable balances resulting from sales-type lease arrangements entered into in 2015. accrued liabilities decreased by $10.5 million mainly due to settlement payments made related to accrued product liability litigation. other changes in operating assets and liabilities include an inventory increase of $10.7 million, net of equipment transfers from inventory to property, plant and equipment, and a decrease in accounts payable of $11.3 million also resulted in cash used by operating activities. the unfavorable impact of these items on cash provided by operating activities was partly offset by a $21.5 million increase in accrued compensation and employee benefits and an $8.2 million increase of deferred revenue.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, cash flow from operations of $665.1 million exceeded our net income of $418.8 million for two primary reasons:
1.   our net income included substantial non-cash charges primarily in the form of share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes, and depreciation. these non-cash charges totaled $232.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2014.
2.   changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in approximately $14.2 million in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2014.
accrued liabilities increased $63.4 million, mainly driven by an increase in product liability accruals. deferred revenue increased by $19.8 million in 2014 primarily due to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts existed. also, accrued compensation and accounts payable increased $39.1 million. the favorable impact of these items on cash provided by operating activities was partly offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $13.7 million in 2014 reflecting timing of our system sales and related collections, a net increase in inventory of $26.8 million primarily due to expanded product offerings, and an increase in prepaids and other assets of $67.6 million, primarily driven by timing of tax payments and an increase in lease receivables relating to sales-type lease arrangements entered into during 2014.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2016, consisted of purchases of investments (net of the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments) of $1.2 billion and purchases of property, plant and equipment $53.9 million.
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2015, consisted of purchases of investments (net of the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments) of $768.5 million and purchases of property and equipment $81.0 million.
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014, consisted primarily of cash used for purchases of property and equipment of $105.6 million and purchases of businesses of $84.3 million, partially offset by the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments (net of purchases of investments) of $36.0 million. purchases of property included the acquisition of approximately 15 acres of land in sunnyvale, california for future expansion in 2014. for the year ended december 31, 2014, we acquired certain intellectual property, know-how, fixed assets, and employees from luna innovations, inc. and we reacquired the distribution rights from our former japanese distributor, adachi co, ltd.
we invest predominantly in high quality, fixed income securities. our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in u.s. treasury and u.s. government agency securities, taxable and/or tax exempt municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, cash deposits, and money market funds.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $580.9 million and excess tax benefits of $44.1 million, partly offset by $42.5 million used for the repurchase of 0.1 million shares of our common stock through open market transactions and taxes paid on behalf of employees related to net share settlement of vested employee equity awards of $24.0 million.
net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $361.1 million and excess tax benefits of $34.3 million, partly offset by $183.7 million used for the repurchase of 0.4 million shares of our common stock through open market transactions and taxes paid on behalf of employees related to net share settlement of vested employee equity awards of $11.0 million.
net cash used in financing activities in 2014 consisted primarily of $1.0 billion used for the repurchase of 2.5 million shares of our common stock through an accelerated share repurchase program, offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $283.6 million and excess tax benefits of $24.0 million.
our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of our products, the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products and other factors. we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to expand procedure adoption and acceptance of our products. we have made substantial investments in our commercial operations, product development activities, facilities, and intellectual property. based upon our business model, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to fund future growth through cash provided from operations. we believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, together with income to be derived from the sale of our products, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements beyond one year and for the foreseeable future.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2016 (in millions):
purchase commitments and obligations       345.8       342.7                       3.1                                    -              -
operating leases. we lease spaces for operations in the u.s. as well as in japan, south korea, mexico, and other foreign countries. we also lease automobiles for certain sales and field service employees. operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our non-cancellable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year.
purchase commitments and obligations. these amounts include an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services and acquisition and licensing of intellectual property. a majority of these purchase obligations are due within a year. although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. in addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and have not been included in the table above.
other commitments. we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when payments may occur for our unrecognized tax benefits. therefore, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2016, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k promulgated under the exchange act.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap"), which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions. see "note 2. summary of significant accounting policies," in notes to the consolidated financial statements, which is included in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data," which describes our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. the methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. our most critical accounting estimates include:
•   the valuation and recognition of investments, which impacts our investment portfolio balance when we assess fair value, and interest and other income, net, when we record impairments;
•   the valuation of revenue and allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts, which impacts revenue;
•   the estimation of transactions to hedge, which impacts revenue and other expense;
•   the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross profit margins;
•   the assessment of recoverability of intangible assets and their estimated useful lives, which primarily impacts gross profit margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their amortization;
•   the valuation and recognition of share-based compensation, which impacts gross profit margin and operating expenses;
•   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; and
•   the estimate of probable loss associated with product liability claims, which impacts accrued liabilities and operating expenses.
investments valuation fair value our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in u.s. treasury and u.s. government agency securities, non-u.s. government securities, taxable and/or tax exempt municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, cash deposits, and money market funds. in the current market environment, the assessment of the fair value of investments can be difficult and subjective. u.s. gaap establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value. valuation of level 1 and 2 instruments generally do not require significant management judgment and the estimation is not difficult. level 3 instruments include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. the determination of fair value for level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. there were no level 3 securities for the periods presented.
other-than-temporary impairment after determining the fair value of our available-for-sales instruments, gains or losses on these securities are recorded to other comprehensive income, until either the security is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other-than-temporary. the primary differentiating factors we considered in classifying impairments as either temporary or other-than-temporary impairments are our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, the length of the time and the extent to which the market value of the investment has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. given the current market conditions, these judgments could prove to be wrong, and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations.
no impairment charges were recorded during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded pre-tax losses of $8.5 million related to a decline in the value of two equity investments that we concluded were other-than-temporary. as of december 31, 2016, and 2015, net unrealized losses on investments of $8.6 million and $4.2 million, net of tax, respectively, were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts. we record estimated reductions in revenue for potential returns of products by customers and other allowances. as a result, management must make estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue. in making such estimates, management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products. if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of reported revenue could result.
similarly, we make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable, especially analyzing the aging and nature of accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends, and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sale transactions before shipment is authorized. on a quarterly basis, we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide an allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts. if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result.
hedge accounting for derivatives. we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency sales transactions. when specific criteria required by relevant accounting standards have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income ("oci") rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. by their nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. when we determine that the transactions are no longer probable within a certain time-frame, we are required to reclassify the cumulative changes in the fair values of the related hedge contracts from oci to net income.
inventory valuation. inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates actual costs, or market, on a first-in, first-out basis. the cost basis of our inventory is reduced for any products that are considered excessive or obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.
intangible assets. our intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill. identifiable intangibles include developed technology, patents, distribution rights, customer relationships, and licenses. all of our identifiable intangibles have finite lives. goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment review (or more frequent if impairment indicators arise) by applying a fair-value based test. there have been no impairments from the analysis required by u.s. gaap.
identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are subject to impairment testing and are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of these identifiable intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets. if the cash flow estimates or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based change in the future, we may be required to record additional impairment charges.
the valuation and classification of intangible assets and goodwill and the assignment of useful lives for purposes of amortization involves judgments and the use of estimates. the evaluation of these intangibles and goodwill for impairment under established accounting guidelines is required on a recurring basis. changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to the assumptions made. when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization over the assets' new, shorter useful lives. no impairment charge or accelerated amortization was recorded for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing impairment, which includes financial forecasts. if conditions are different from management's current estimates, material write-downs of long-lived assets may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results.
revenue recognition. our system sale arrangements contain multiple elements, including system(s), system accessories, instruments, accessories, and system service. we generally deliver all of the elements, other than service, within days of entering into the system sale arrangement. each of these elements is a separate unit of accounting. system accessories, instruments, accessories, and service are also sold on a stand-alone basis.
for multiple-element arrangements, revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting based on their relative selling prices. relative selling prices are based first on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value ("vsoe"), then on third-party evidence of selling price ("tpe") when vsoe does not exist, and then on management's best estimate of the selling price ("esp") when vsoe and tpe do not exist.
our system sales arrangements generally include a one-year period of free service and four additional years of service that are generally billed for separately on an annual basis at a contractually stated price. the revenue allocated to the free service period is deferred and recognized ratably over the free service period. amounts billed for the additional years of service are recorded into deferred revenue when they are billed and recognized ratably over the service period.
because we have neither vsoe nor tpe for our systems, the allocation of revenue is based on esp for the systems sold. the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale, had the product been sold on a stand-alone basis. we determine esp for our systems by considering multiple factors, including, but not limited to, features and functionality of the system, geographies, type of customer, and market conditions. we regularly review esp and maintain internal controls over establishing and updating these estimates.
accounting for stock options. we account for share-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of u.s. gaap. we use the black-scholes-merton option-pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term, and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements. the assumptions for expected volatility and expected term are the two assumptions that most significantly affect the grant date fair value of stock options. changes in expected risk-free rate of return do not significantly impact the calculation of fair value, and determining this input is not highly subjective.
we use implied volatility based on freely traded options in the open market, as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. in determining the appropriateness of relying on implied volatility, we considered the following:
•   the sufficiency of the trading volume of freely traded options;
•   the ability to reasonably match the terms, such as the date of the grant and the exercise price of the freely traded options to options granted; and
•   the length of the term of the freely traded options used to derive implied volatility.
the expected term represents the weighted-average period that our stock options are expected to be outstanding. the expected term is based on the observed and expected time to exercise. we determine expected term based on historical exercise patterns and our expectation of the time it will take for employees to exercise options still outstanding.
u.s. gaap requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover. adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on our reported share-based compensation, as we recognize the cumulative effect of the rate adjustments for all expense amortization in the period the estimated forfeiture rates were adjusted. we estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a periodic review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover. if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than previously estimated forfeiture rate, we may make an adjustment that will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the period when the rate was changed. adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates could also cause changes in the amount of expense that we recognize in future periods.
changes in these subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock options and, consequently, the related amount of share-based compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income.
accounting for income taxes. significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in accordance with u.s. gaap. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in the current or subsequent period.
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. if recovery is less than a 50% likelihood, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be recoverable. as of december 31, 2016, we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets ultimately will be recovered with the exception of our california deferred tax assets. we believe that due to the computation of california taxes under the single sales factor, it is more likely than not that our california deferred tax assets will not be realized. should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be affected in the period in which such change takes place.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, then the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effective settlement of audit issues, and new audit activity. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
accounting for legal contingencies. we are involved in a number of legal proceedings involving product liability, intellectual property, shareholder derivative actions, securities class actions, insurance, employee related, and other matters. we record a liability and related charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements for legal contingencies when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. our assessment is reevaluated each accounting period and is based on all available information, including discussion with any outside legal counsel that represents us. if a reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss cannot be made, but a range of probable losses can be estimated, the low-end of the range of losses is recognized if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other. if a loss is reasonably possible, but not probable and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
when determining the estimated probable loss or range of losses, significant judgment is required to be exercised in order to estimate the amount and timing of the loss to be recorded. estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation are inherently difficult to make, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete facts and information. the final outcome of legal proceedings is dependent on many variables difficult to predict, and therefore, the ultimate cost to entirely resolve such matters may be materially different than the amount of current estimates. consequently, new information or changes in judgments and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows.
recent accounting pronouncements see "note 2. summary of significant accounting policies" of the notes to consolidated financial statements in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any on our consolidated financial statements.

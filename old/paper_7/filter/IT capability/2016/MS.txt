$17,953 million in 2015, primarily as a result of lower investment banking and sales and trading revenues, partially offset by higher other revenues.
                     wealth management net revenues of $15,350 million in 2016 increased 2% from $15,100 million in 2015, primarily as a result of growth in net interest income, partially offset by lower commissions and fees and investment banking revenues.
                                                         investment management net revenues of $2,112 million in 2016 decreased 9% from $2,315 million in
2015, primarily reflecting weaker investment performance compared with 2015. this was partially offset by carried interest losses in 2015 associated with asia private equity that did not re-occur in 2016.
asset management fees in 2016 were relatively unchanged from 2015.
business segment net revenues: 2015 compared with 2014

2014, primarily reflecting the reversal of previously accrued carried interest, reduction in revenues attributable to non-controlling interests and markdowns on principal investments.
consolidated non-interest expenses: 2016 compared with 2015
                                                                  compensation and benefits expenses of $15,878 million in 2016 decreased 1% from $16,016 million in
2015, primarily due to a decrease in salaries, severance costs, discretionary incentive compensation and employer taxes, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments.
                                 non-compensation expenses were $9,905 million in 2016 compared with $10,644 million in 2015, representing a 7% decrease, primarily due to lower litigation costs and expense management.

2014, primarily as a result of the 2014 compensation actions, and a decrease in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments, related carried interest, and the level of discretionary incentive compensation in 2015 (see also
supplemental financial information and disclosuresdiscretionary incentive compensation herein).

managements discussion and analysis return on equity target we are aiming to improve our return to shareholders and, accordingly, have established a target return on average common equity (return on equity target) of 9% to 11%, excluding dva to be achieved by 2017, subject to the successful execution of our strategic objectives. we plan to progress toward achieving our return on equity target through the following key elements of our strategy:
   revenue and profitability growth:
                          wealth management pre-tax margin improvement to approximately 23% to
25% through net interest income growth via continued high-quality lending, expense efficiency and business growth;
   continued strength in investment banking and equity sales and trading results;
   stable performance in fixed income sales and trading and investment management;
   expense efficiency:
                                     successful completion of project streamline, our expense savings program launched in 2016 to reduce expenses by $1 billion by 2017 (not including any outsized litigation expense or penalties) assuming a flat revenue environment, resulting in an expense efficiency target ratio of 74%;
   sufficient capital:
   increasing capital returns to shareholders, subject to regulatory approval.
our return on equity target and the related strategies and goals are forward-looking statements that may be materially affected by many factors, including, among other things: macroeconomic and market conditions; legislative and regulatory developments; industry trading and investment banking volumes; equity market levels; interest rate environment; legal expenses and the ability to reduce expenses in general; capital levels; and discrete tax items. given the uncertainties surrounding these and other factors, there are significant risks that our return on equity target and the related strategies and goals may not be realized. actual results may differ from our goals and targets, and the differences may be material and adverse. accordingly, we caution that undue reliance should not be placed on any of these forward-looking statements. see forward-looking statements immediately preceding part i, item 1 and risk factors in part i, item 1a for additional information regarding these forward-looking statements.
return on average common equity and pre-tax margin are non-gaap financial measures that we consider to be a useful measure to us, investors and analysts to assess operating performance. see selected non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-gaap) financial information herein. our expense efficiency ratio represents total non-interest expenses as a percentage of net revenues. for 2016, our expense efficiency ratio was 74.5%, which was calculated as non-interest expenses of $25,783 million divided by net revenues of $34,631 million.
business segments substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures.
as a result of treating certain intersegment transactions as transactions with external parties, we include an intersegment eliminations category to reconcile the business segment results to our consolidated results.
net revenues investment banking.    investment banking revenues are composed of fees from advisory services and revenues from the underwriting of securities offerings and syndication of loans, net of syndication expenses.
trading.    trading revenues include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments in which we act as a market maker, as well as gains and losses on our related positions and other positions carried at fair value. trading revenues include the realized gains and losses from sales of cash instruments and derivative settlements, unrealized gains and losses from ongoing fair value changes of our positions related to market-making activities, and gains and losses related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans and other positions carried at fair value. in many markets, the realized and unrealized gains and losses from the purchase and sale transactions will include any spreads between bids and offers. certain fees received on loans carried at fair value and dividends from equity securities are also recorded in trading revenues since they relate to positions carried at fair value.
as a market maker, we stand ready to buy, sell or otherwise transact with customers under a variety of market conditions and to provide firm or indicative prices in response to customer requests. our liquidity obligations can be explicit in some cases, and in others, customers expect us to be willing to transact with them. in order to most effectively fulfill our
37      december 2016 form 10-k managements discussion and analysis market-making function, we engage in activities across all of our trading businesses that include, but are not limited to:
(i)       taking positions in anticipation of, and in response to, customer demand to buy or sell anddepending on the liquidity of the relevant market and the size of the positionto hold those positions for a period of time;
(ii)   managing and assuming basis risk (risk associated with imperfect hedging) between customized customer risks and the standardized products available in the market to hedge those risks;
(iii)   building, maintaining and rebalancing inventory, through trades with other market participants, and engaging in accumulation activities to accommodate anticipated customer demand;
(iv)   trading in the market to remain current on pricing and trends; and
(v)   engaging in other activities to provide efficiency and liquidity for markets.
although not included in trading revenues, interest income and expense are also impacted by market-making activities, as debt securities held by us earn interest and securities are loaned, borrowed, sold with agreement to repurchase and purchased with agreement to resell.
we often invest in investments or other financial instruments to economically hedge our obligations under certain deferred compensation plans. changes in the value of such investments are recorded in either trading revenues or investments revenues. expenses associated with the related deferred compensation plans are recorded in compensation and benefits. generally, changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in fair value of the referenced investment will be offset by changes in fair value of the investments made by us.
investments.    our investments generally are held for long-term appreciation, or as discussed above, for hedging purposes and generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. estimates of the fair value of the investments may involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions. in some cases, such investments are required or are a necessary part of offering other products.
the revenues recorded are the result of realized gains and losses from sales and unrealized gains and losses from ongoing fair value changes of our holdings, as well as from investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans.
typically, there are no fee revenues from these investments. the sales restrictions on the investments relate primarily to redemption and withdrawal restrictions on investments in certain investment management funds, which include investments made in connection with certain employee deferred compensation plans (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8). restrictions on interests in exchanges and clearinghouses generally include a requirement to hold those interests for the period of time where we are clearing trades on that exchange or clearinghouse. additionally, there are certain sponsored investment management funds consolidated by us primarily related to holders of noncontrolling interests.
commissions and fees.    commission and fee revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and over-the-counter (otc) equity securities, services related to sales and trading activities, and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options. commissions received for purchasing and selling listed equity securities and options are recorded separately in commissions and fees. other cash and derivative instruments typically do not have fees associated with them, and fees for any related services are recorded in commissions and fees.
asset management, distribution and administration fees.    asset management, distribution and administration fees include fees associated with the management and supervision of assets, account services and administration, performance-based fees relating to certain funds, separately managed accounts, shareholder servicing and the distribution of certain open-ended mutual funds.
asset management, distribution and administration fees in the wealth management business segment also include revenues from individual and institutional investors electing a fee-based pricing arrangement and fees for investment management. mutual fund distribution fees in the wealth management business segment are based on either the average daily fund net asset balances or average daily aggregate net fund sales and are affected by changes in the overall level and mix of assets under management or supervision.
asset management fees in the investment management business segment arise from investment management services we provide to investment vehicles pursuant to various contractual arrangements. we receive fees primarily based upon mutual fund daily average net assets or based on monthly or quarterly invested equity for other vehicles. performance-based fees in the investment management business segment are earned on certain products as a percentage of appreciation earned by those products and, in certain cases, are based upon the achievement of performance criteria. these fees are normally earned annually and are recognized on a monthly or quarterly basis.
managements discussion and analysis net interest.    interest income and interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including trading assets and trading liabilities; investment securities, which include available-for-sale (afs) securities and held-to-maturity (htm) securities; securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell; securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase; loans; deposits; other short-term borrowings; long-term borrowings; trading strategies; customer activity in the prime brokerage business; and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest rates.
other.    other revenues include revenues from equity method investments, realized gains and losses on afs securities, gains and losses on loans held for sale, provision for loan losses, and other miscellaneous revenues.
net revenues by segment institutional securities.    net revenues are composed of investment banking revenues, sales and trading net revenues, investments and other revenues.
for information about the composition of investment banking revenues, see net revenues herein.   sales and trading net revenues are composed of trading revenues; commissions and fees; asset management, distribution and administration fees; and net interest. in assessing the profitability of our sales and trading activities, we view these net revenues in the aggregate. in addition, decisions relating to trading are based on an overall review of aggregate revenues and costs associated with each transaction or series of transactions. this review includes, among other things, an assessment of the potential gain or loss associated with a transaction, including any associated commissions and fees, dividends, the interest income or expense associated with financing or hedging our positions and other related expenses.
sales and trading revenues are broken down into major business lines as follows: equity, fixed income and other. see sales and trading activitiesequity and fixed income for a description of the activities within equity and fixed income. other sales and trading revenues include impacts from certain central treasury functions, such as liquidity costs and gains (losses) on economic hedges related to long-term borrowings, as well as certain activities associated with corporate lending activities.
for information about revenue from investments, see net revenues herein.
other revenues include revenues from equity method investments, gains and losses on loans held for sale, provision for loan losses, and other miscellaneous revenues.
wealth management.    net revenues are composed of transactional, asset management, net interest and other revenues.
transactional revenues include investment banking, trading, and commissions and fees. investment banking revenues include revenues from the distribution of equity and fixed income securities, including initial public offerings, secondary offerings, closed-end funds and unit trusts. trading revenues include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments, in which we act as principal, and gains and losses associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans. revenues from commissions and fees primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and otc equity securities and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options.
asset management revenues include asset management, distribution and administration fees, and referral fees related to the bank deposit program.
net interest income includes interest related to the bank deposit program, interest on afs securities and htm securities, interest on lending activities and other net interest. interest income and interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities. net interest is driven by securities-based lending, mortgage lending, margin loans, securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions, and bank deposit program activity.
other revenues include revenues from realized gains and losses on afs securities, provision for loan losses, referral fees and other miscellaneous revenues.
investment management.    investments revenue is primarily earned on investments in certain closed-end funds that generally are held for long-term appreciation and generally subject to sales restrictions. estimates of the fair value of the investments involve significant judgment and may fluctuate materially over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions.
for information about the composition of asset management, distribution and administration fees, see net revenues herein.   compensation expense compensation and benefits expense includes accruals for base salaries and fixed allowances, formulaic programs, discretionary incentive compensation, amortization of deferred cash and equity awards, changes in fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments, carried interest, severance costs, and other items such as health and welfare benefits. the factors that drive compensation for our employees vary from quarter to quarter, from segment to segment and within a segment. for certain revenue-producing employees in the wealth management and investment management business segments, compensation is largely paid
39      december 2016 form 10-k managements discussion and analysis on the basis of formulaic payouts that link employee compensation to revenues. compensation for certain employees, including revenue-producing employees in the institutional securities business segment, may also include incentive compensation that is determined following the assessment of the firm, business unit and individual performance. compensation for our remaining employees is largely fixed in nature (e.g., base salary, benefits, etc.).
compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation plans is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for upward and downward changes in fair value of the referenced investment, and is recognized ratably over the prescribed vesting period for the award. however, there may be a timing difference between the immediate revenue recognition of gains and losses on our investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period.
income taxes the income tax provision for our business segments is generally determined based on the revenues, expenses and activities directly attributable to each business segment. certain items have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues or other relevant measures.

2016 compared with 2015
investment banking revenues of $4,476 million in 2016 decreased 11% from 2015 due to lower underwriting revenues, partially offset by an increase in advisory revenues in 2016.

         equity underwriting revenues decreased as a result of lower equity-related offerings in 2016 (see investment banking volumes table). fixed income underwriting revenues decreased in 2016, primarily due to lower bond and loan fees.
2015 compared with 2014
investment banking revenues of $5,008 million in 2015 decreased 4% from 2014 due to lower underwriting revenues, partially offset by higher advisory revenues.
                        equity underwriting revenues decreased on reduced volumes driven by lower initial public offerings (see investment banking volumes table). fixed income underwriting revenues decreased primarily driven by lower non-investment grade bond and loan fees.

equitiesexecution services.    we make markets for our clients in equity-related securities and derivative products, including providing liquidity and hedging products. a significant portion of the results for this business is generated by commissions and fees from executing and clearing client transactions on major stock and derivative exchanges as well as from otc transactions. market-making also generates gains and losses on inventory, which are reflected in trading revenues.

2.   funding costs are allocated to the businesses based on funding usage and are included in net interest in the previous tables. such allocations were estimated for prior periods to conform to the current presentation.
3.                                                                  in 2016, in accordance with the early adoption of a provision of the accounting update recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, unrealized dva gains (losses) are recorded within oci in the consolidated comprehensive income statements. in 2015 and 2014, the dva gains (losses) were recorded within trading revenues in the consolidated income statements. see notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further information.
as discussed in net revenues by segment herein, we manage each of the sales and trading businesses based on its aggregate net revenues, which are comprised of the consolidated income statement line items quantified in the previous table. trading revenues are affected by a variety of market dynamics, including volumes, bid-offer spreads, and inventory prices, as well as impacts from hedging activity, which are interrelated. we provide qualitative commentary in the discussion of results that follow on the key drivers of period over period variances, as the quantitative impact of the various market dynamics typically cannot be disaggregated.
for additional information on total trading revenues, see the table trading revenues by product type in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8.
2016 compared with 2015
equity excluding the $163 million positive impact of dva on 2015 results, equity sales and trading net revenues of $8,037 million in 2016 were lower than 2015, reflecting lower results in both financing and execution services revenues.
                                    financing revenues were in line with the results from 2015 as net interest revenues declined from higher net interest costs, reflecting the business increased portion of global liquidity reserve requirements, offset by increased client activity in equity swaps reflected in trading.
$196 million due to reduced client activity.
fixed income excluding the $455 million positive impact of dva on 2015 results, fixed income net revenues of $5,117 million in 2016 were 19% higher than 2015, primarily due to improved results in credit products.
                        credit products trading revenues were the primary driver for the overall increase in fixed income trading revenues of $782 million, reflecting an improved credit market environment that resulted in gains on inventory in 2016 compared with losses in 2015.
                                                                          overall results from other fixed income businesses were relatively unchanged. there was a net increase in trading revenues from global macro products, reflecting gains on inventory in interest rate products, offset by declines in commodities activities, primarily due to the absence of revenues from the global oil merchanting business, which was sold on november 1, 2015. for more information on the sale of the global oil merchanting business, see investments, other revenues, non-interest expenses, income tax items, dispositions and other items2015 compared with 2014dispositions herein.
   other sales and trading net losses of $853 million in 2016 increased from 2015, primarily reflecting losses in 2016 associated with corporate loan hedging activity.

2015 compared with 2014
equity equity sales and trading net revenues, excluding the impact of dva and the implementation of fva, increased reflecting higher results in financing and execution services revenues.
                              financing revenues increased 19% from 2014 with an increase in client balances and derivative activity reflected in the $457 million increase in trading revenues primarily from equity swaps and a $103 million increase in net interest revenues for securities.
      execution services increased 17% from 2014, primarily due to the $587 million increase in trading revenues from client activity in derivatives and reduced inventory losses compared with the prior year.
fixed income excluding the $455 million positive impact of dva on 2015 results, and the $419 million positive impact of dva and the $466 million negative impact from the implementation of fva on 2014 results, fixed income net revenues of $4,303 million in 2015 were 1% higher than 2014 due to improved results in global macro and commodities products, offset by lower results in credit products.
              global macro products results increased from 2014, primarily due to an increase in trading revenues due to improved results in interest rate products as a result of inventory gains and improved performance in foreign exchange products
                                                                       credit products decreased, primarily driven by a decrease in trading revenues from lower results in credit and securitized products from a widening credit spread environment, which led to inventory losses. this decrease was partially offset by an increase in net interest revenues, driven primarily by a change in the product mix in the securitized products group assets.
                                                                 commodities products net revenues increased, primarily reflecting higher revenues from the global oil merchanting business, which was sold on november 1, 2015. the increase was partially offset by credit-driven losses and the absence of revenues from transmontaigne inc., which was sold on july 1, 2014 (see investments, other revenues, non-interest expenses, income tax items, dispositions and other items2015 compared with 2014dispositions herein).

2016 compared with 2015
investments
                    net investment gains of $147 million in 2016 decreased from 2015 as a result of lower gains on real estate and business-related investments and losses on investments associated with our compensation plans compared with gains in 2015.
                          other revenues of $535 million in 2016 increased from 2015, primarily reflecting mark-to-market gains on loans held for sale in 2016 compared with mark-to-market losses in
2015, partially offset by lower results related to our 40% stake in mitsubishi ufj morgan stanley securities co., ltd. (mumss) (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further information).
non-interest expenses non-interest expenses of $12,336 million in 2016 decreased from 2015, primarily reflecting a 3% reduction in compensation and benefits expenses and an 11% reduction in non-compensation expenses in 2016.
                                   compensation and benefits expenses decreased in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in salaries, severance costs, discretionary incentive compensation and employer taxes, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments.
                                                                    non-compensation expenses decreased in 2016, primarily due to lower litigation costs and professional services expense. in 2015, non-compensation expenses included increases to reserves for the settlement of a credit default swap (cds) antitrust litigation matter and legacy residential mortgage-backed securities matters.
2015 compared with 2014
investments
   net investment gains of $274 million in 2015 increased 14% from 2014 driven by gains on business-related investments.
                                    other revenues of $221 million in 2015 decreased 68% from 2014 due to the absence of gains realized on certain assets sold in 2014 (see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8) and markdowns and provisions on loans held for sale and held for investment.
managements discussion and analysis non-interest expenses non-interest expenses of $13,282 million in 2015 decreased 22% from 2014 driven by a 25% reduction in non-compensation expenses and a 17% reduction in compensation and benefits expenses.

   non-compensation expenses decreased, primarily due to lower litigation costs.
income tax items in 2016, we recognized in provision for (benefit from) income taxes net discrete tax benefits of $83 million. these net discrete tax benefits were primarily related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination, partially offset by adjustments for other tax matters.
in 2015, we recognized in provision for (benefit from) income taxes net discrete tax benefits of $564 million. these net discrete tax benefits were primarily associated with the repatriation of non-u.s. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated due to an internal restructuring to simplify our legal entity organization in the united kingdom (u.k.).
in 2014, we recognized in provision for (benefit from) income taxes net discrete tax benefits of $839 million. this included net discrete tax benefits of $612 million principally associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination and $237 million primarily associated with the repatriation of non-u.s. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated. in addition, our provision for (benefit from) income taxes was impacted by approximately $900 million of tax provision as a result of non-deductible expenses related to litigation and regulatory matters.

on march 27, 2014, we completed the sale of canterm canadian terminals inc., a public storage terminal operator for refined products with two distribution terminals in canada. the gain on sale was approximately $45 million and was recognized in other revenues.
other items japanese securities joint venture we hold a 40% voting interest and mitsubishi ufj financial group, inc. (mufg) holds a 60% voting interest in mumss.
to the extent that losses incurred by mumss result in a requirement to restore its capital level, mufg is solely responsible for providing this additional capital to a minimum level, whereas we are not obligated to contribute additional capital to mumss. to the extent that mumss is required to increase its capital level due to factors other than losses, such as changes in regulatory requirements, both mufg and we are required to contribute the necessary capital based upon the economic interest as set forth above.

managements discussion and analysis
2016 compared with 2015
net revenues transactional revenues transactional revenues of $3,090 million in 2016 decreased 7% from the prior year, primarily reflecting lower revenues related to commissions and fees and investment banking revenues, partially offset by higher trading revenues.
   investment banking revenues decreased in 2016, primarily due to lower revenues from the distribution of unit investment trusts, equity and structured products.
   trading revenues increased in 2016, primarily due to gains related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans compared with losses in 2015.
                        commissions and fees decreased in 2016 reflecting lower daily average commissions, primarily due to reduced client activity in equity, annuity and mutual fund products. this decrease was partially offset by increased fees due to the fixed income integration.
asset management asset management, distribution and administration fees of $8,454 million in 2016 decreased 1% from the prior year, primarily due to the decrease in mutual fund fees. revenues from fee-based accounts were relatively flat with decreased client fee rates, partially offset by positive flows. see fee-based client assets activity and average fee rate by account type herein for more details.
net interest net interest of $3,529 million in 2016 increased 19% from the prior year, primarily due to higher loan balances and investment portfolio yields.
other other revenues of $277 million in 2016 increased 9% from the prior year due to the combination of higher referral fees in 2016 and a decrease in provision for loan losses in 2016.
   compensation and benefits expenses increased in 2016, primarily due to an increase in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments.
   non-compensation expenses increased in 2016, primarily as a result of a $70 million provision related to certain brokerage service reporting activities. see other items herein.
2015 compared with 2014
net revenues transactional revenues transactional revenues of $3,335 million in 2015 decreased 14% from the prior year due to lower revenues in each of trading, investment banking, and commissions and fees.
   investment banking revenues decreased, primarily due to lower revenues from the distribution of underwritten offerings.
   trading revenues decreased, primarily due to losses related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans and lower revenues from fixed income products.
   commissions and fees decreased, primarily due to lower revenues from equity, mutual fund and annuity products, partially offset by higher revenues from alternative asset classes.
asset management asset management, distribution and administration fees of $8,536 million in 2015 increased 2% from the prior year, primarily due to higher fee-based revenues that resulted from positive flows and higher average market values over 2015 as compared with the average market values during 2014. the increase in fee-based revenues was partially offset by lower referral fees from the bank deposit program, reflecting the completion of the transfer of deposits from citigroup inc. (citi) to us in connection with the former retail securities joint venture between the firm and citi. see fee-based client assets activity and average fee rate by account type herein for more details.
net interest net interest of $2,956 million in 2015 increased 26% from the prior year, primarily due to higher balances in the bank deposit program and growth in loans and lending commitments.
other other revenues of $255 million in 2015 decreased 20% from the prior year, primarily due to a $40 million gain on sale of a retail property space in the prior year and an increase in the provision for loan losses in 2015.
47      december 2016 form 10-k managements discussion and analysis non-interest expenses non-interest expenses of $11,768 million in 2015 decreased 1% from the prior year, primarily due to lower compensation and benefit expenses, partially offset by higher non-compensation expenses.
                                                                compensation and benefits expenses decreased, primarily due to the 2014 compensation actions, a decrease in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments and a decrease in the level of discretionary incentive compensation in 2015 (see also supplemental financial information and disclosuresdiscretionary incentive compensation herein).
                                                                                         non-compensation expenses increased, primarily due to an increase in professional services, resulting from increased consulting and legal fees, partially offset by a provision related to a rescission offer in the prior year. other expenses in 2014 included $50 million related to a rescission offer to wealth management clients who may not have received a prospectus for certain securities transactions, for which delivery of a prospectus was required.
income tax items in 2014, we recognized in provision for (benefit from) income taxes net discrete tax benefits of $1,390 million due to the release of a deferred tax liability as a result of an internal restructuring to simplify our legal entity organization. for a further discussion of these net discrete tax benefits, see supplemental financial information and disclosuresincome tax matters herein.
other items the firm has identified operational issues that resulted in the reporting of incorrect cost basis tax information to the internal revenue service (irs) and retail brokerage clients for tax years 2011 through 2016. most of our clients are not impacted by these issues. however, these issues have affected a significant number of client accounts. in the case of clients for whom the firm has determined that there have been tax underpayments to the irs as a result of these issues, the firm is in advanced discussions with the irs to resolve client tax underpayments to the irs caused by these issues at no expense to our clients. in the case of clients for whom the firm has determined that there have been tax overpayments to the irs as a result of these issues, the firm plans to notify them and to offer to pay them an amount equivalent to their overpayment to the irs. the $70 million provision referred to above is based on currently available information and analyses, and our review of these issues is continuing.
fee-based client assets activity and average fee rate by account type wealth management earns fees based on a contractual percentage of fee-based client assets related to certain account types that we offer. these fees, which we record in the asset management, distribution and administration fees line on its income statement, are earned based on the client assets in the specific account types in which the client participates and are generally not driven by asset class. for most account types, fees are billed in the first month of each quarter based on the related client assets as of the end of the prior quarter. across the account types, fees will vary based on both the distinct services provided within each account type and on the level of household assets under supervision in wealth management.

2016 compared with 2015
net revenues investments
                                    investments gains of $13 million in 2016 decreased 95% from the prior year reflecting weaker investment performance compared with the prior year. this was partially offset by carried interest losses in 2015 associated with asia private equity that did not re-occur in 2016.
asset management, distribution and administration fees
                                                                        asset management, distribution and administration fees of $2,063 million in 2016 were relatively unchanged from the prior year, as increases in management fees resulting from higher assets under management or supervision (aum) and average fee rates in certain products were offset by lower performance fees (see aum and average fee rate by asset class herein).
non-interest expenses non-interest expenses of $1,825 million in 2016 were relatively unchanged from the prior year, primarily due to higher non-compensation expenses offset by lower compensation and benefits expenses.
   compensation and benefits expenses decreased, primarily due to a decrease in salaries.
               non-compensation expenses increased, primarily due to higher brokerage clearing and exchange fees, partially offset by lower litigation costs and expense management.
2015 compared with 2014
net revenues investments
               investments gains of $249 million in 2015 decreased 58% from the prior year reflecting the reversal of previously accrued carried interest associated with asia private equity and additional net markdowns on principal investments.
asset management, distribution and administration fees
                                        asset management, distribution and administration fees were unchanged from the prior year as the impact of positive net flows was offset by a shift in the asset class mix from equity and fixed income products to liquidity products (see aum and average fee rate by asset class herein).
   other revenues of $32 million in 2015 decreased 70% from the prior year due to lower revenues associated with our minority investment in certain third-party investment managers.
non-interest expenses non-interest expenses of $1,823 million in 2015 decreased 11% from the prior year, primarily due to lower compensation and benefit expenses, partially offset by higher non-compensation expenses.
                                                              compensation and benefits expenses decreased, primarily due to the 2014 compensation actions, a decrease in deferred compensation associated with carried interest and a decrease in the level of incentive compensation in 2015 (see also supplemental financial information and disclosuresdiscretionary incentive compensation herein).
                                               non-compensation expenses increased, primarily due to higher brokerage clearing and exchange fees, and professional services resulting from higher consulting and legal fees and information processing and communications expenses.

legal expenses incurred in 2015 were primarily related to increases in reserves for the settlement of a credit default swap antitrust litigation matter and for legacy residential mortgage-backed securities matters. the legal expenses incurred in 2014 were principally due to reserve additions and settlements related to legacy residential mortgage-backed securities and credit crisis related matters, including our $2,600 million agreement with the united states department of justice, civil division, which was reached on february 25, 2015 and finalized on february 10, 2016 (see contingencieslegal in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8).

included in the effective tax rate for 2016 were net discrete tax benefits of $68 million, primarily related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination, partially offset by adjustments for other tax matters. excluding these net discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2016 would have been 31.6%, which is generally reflective of the geographic mix of earnings.
included in the effective tax rate for 2015 were net discrete tax benefits of $564 million, primarily associated with the repatriation of non-u.s. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated due to an internal restructuring to simplify the legal entity organization in the u.k. excluding these net discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2015 would have been 32.5%.
included in the effective tax rate for 2014 were net discrete tax benefits of $2,226 million. these net discrete tax benefits consisted of: $1,380 million primarily due to the release of a deferred tax liability, previously established as part of the acquisition of smith barney in 2009 through a charge to additional paid-in capital, as a result of the legal entity restructuring that included a change in tax status of morgan stanley smith barney holdings llc from a partnership to a corporation; $609 million principally associated with the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination; and $237 million primarily associated with the repatriation of non-u.s. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated. excluding these net discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2014 would have been 59.5%, which is primarily attributable to approximately $900 million of tax provision from non-deductible expenses for litigation and regulatory matters.
discretionary incentive compensation on december 1, 2014, the compensation, management development and succession committee (cmds committee) of our board of directors (the board) approved an approach for awards of discretionary incentive compensation for the 2014 performance year that were granted in 2015, which reduced the average deferral of such awards to an approximate baseline of 50%. additionally, the cmds committee approved the acceleration of vesting for certain outstanding deferred cash-based incentive compensation awards. the deferred cash-based incentive compensation awards subject to accelerated vesting will be distributed on their regularly scheduled future distribution dates and will continue to be subject to cancellation and clawback provisions. the following table presents the increase in compensation and benefits expense for the firm and each of the business segments as a result of these actions in 2014 (2014 compensation actions).

accounting development updates the financial accounting standards board issued the following accounting updates that apply to us.
we consider the applicability and impact of all accounting updates. accounting updates not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
                                                                                        improvements to employee share-based payment accounting. this accounting update simplifies the accounting for employee share-based payments, including the recognition of forfeitures, the classification of income tax consequences, and the classification within the cash flow statements. this guidance became effective for us as of january 1, 2017, and the transition impact was not significant. with this update, the income tax consequences for these payments are required to be recognized in provision for income taxes in the consolidated income statements instead of additional paid-in capital. the impact of the income tax consequences may be either a benefit or a provision, and will primarily occur in the first quarter of each year as share-based awards to employees are
53      december 2016 form 10-k managements discussion and analysis converted to morgan stanley shares. the impact of recognizing excess tax benefits upon conversion of awards in january 2017 was an approximate $110 million benefit to the provision for income taxes.
the following accounting updates are currently being evaluated to determine the potential impact of adoption:
                                                                                         revenue from contracts with customers. this accounting update aims to clarify the principles of revenue recognition, to develop a common revenue recognition standard across all industries for u.s. gaap and international financial reporting standards, and to provide enhanced disclosures for users of the financial statements.
the core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenues to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. we will adopt the guidance on january 1, 2018 and are currently evaluating the method of adoption.
we expect this accounting update to potentially change the timing and presentation of certain revenues, as well as the timing and presentation of certain related costs, for investment banking fees and asset management, distribution and administration fees. outside of investment management performance fees in the form of carried interest, discussed further in the following paragraph, these changes are not expected to be significant.
regarding the recognition of performance fees from fund management activities in the form of carried interest that are subject to reversal, there are alternative views in the industry which include consideration as to whether these arrangements are in the scope of the new revenue guidance or are financial instruments under the scope of equity method of accounting. if we follow the equity method of accounting principles, the current recognition of such fees would remain essentially unchanged. if the fees are deemed in the scope of the new revenue guidance, we would defer recognition until such fees are no longer subject to reversal, which would cause a significant delay in the recognition of these fees as revenue. we are currently assessing the alternative accounting approaches and continue to closely monitor developments in this still-evolving area.
we will continue to assess the impact of the new rule as we progress through the implementation of the new standard; therefore, additional impacts may be identified prior to adoption.
                                          financial instrumentscredit losses. this accounting update impacts the impairment model for certain financial assets measured at amortized cost such as loans held for investment and htm securities. the amendments in this
update will accelerate the recognition of credit losses by replacing the incurred loss impairment methodology with a current expected credit loss (cecl) methodology that requires an estimate of expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial asset. additionally, although the cecl methodology will not apply to afs debt securities, the update will require establishment of an allowance to reflect impairment of these securities, thereby eliminating the concept of a permanent write-down. this update is effective as of january 1, 2020.
                                                                                         leases. this accounting update requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet all leases with terms exceeding one year, which results in the recognition of a right of use asset and corresponding lease liability, including for those leases that we currently classify as operating leases. the right of use asset and lease liability will initially be measured using the present value of the remaining rental payments. the accounting for leases where we are the lessor is largely unchanged. this update is effective as of january 1, 2019.
                                                                                       gains and losses from the derecognition of nonfinancial assets. this accounting update clarifies the guidance on how to account for the derecognition of nonfinancial assets and in substance nonfinancial assets and also provides guidance on the accounting for partial sales of nonfinancial assets. this update is effective as of january 1, 2018.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, which require us to make estimates and assumptions (see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8). we believe that of our significant accounting policies (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8), the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.
fair value financial instruments measured at fair value a significant number of our financial instruments are carried at fair value. we make estimates regarding valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the consolidated financial statements. these assets and liabilities include, but are not limited to:
   trading assets and trading liabilities;
   investment securitiesafs securities;
   certain securities purchased under agreements to resell;
   certain deposits, primarily structured certificates of deposits;
managements discussion and analysis
   certain securities sold under agreements to repurchase;
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
in determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches. a hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when available. the hierarchy is broken down into three levels, wherein level 1 represents quoted prices in active markets, level 2 represents valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, and level 3 consists of valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs and, therefore, require the greatest use of judgment. in periods of market disruption, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. this condition could cause an instrument to be recategorized from level 1 to level 2 or from level 2 to level 3. in addition, a downturn in market conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of many instruments. for further information on the valuation process, fair value definition, level 1, level 2, level 3 and related valuation techniques, and quantitative information about and sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs used in level 3 fair value measurements, see notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8.
where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty and concentration risk in order to arrive at fair value. for a further discussion of valuation adjustments that we apply, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8.
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, certain of our assets and liabilities were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, primarily relating to loans, other investments, premises, equipment and software costs, intangible assets, other assets and other liabilities, and accrued expenses. we incur losses or gains for any adjustments of these assets to fair value. a downturn in market conditions could result in impairment charges in future periods.
for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, fair value is determined by using various valuation approaches. the same hierarchy as described above, which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by generally requiring that the observable inputs be used when available, is used in measuring fair value for these items.
see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further information on assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
fair value control processes we employ control processes designed to validate the fair value of our financial instruments, including those derived from pricing models. these control processes are designed to ensure that the values used for financial reporting are based on observable inputs wherever possible. in the event that observable inputs are not available, the control processes are designed to ensure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable.
see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information regarding our valuation policies, processes and procedures.
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on july 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. we test for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below its business segments. goodwill no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a reporting unit. as such, all the activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically developed, are available to support the value of the goodwill. for both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is not required. however, if we conclude otherwise, then we are required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test. goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying value. if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value,
55      december 2016 form 10-k managements discussion and analysis goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired. if the estimated fair value is below carrying value, however, further analysis is required to determine the amount of the impairment.
the estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each of the reporting units. the estimated fair value is generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology or methodologies that incorporate price-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable companies. at each annual goodwill impairment testing date, each of our reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value.
intangible assets amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life and are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. an impairment exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. an impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows.
for both goodwill and intangible assets, to the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. for amortizable intangible assets, the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset. adverse market or economic events could result in impairment charges in future periods.
see notes 2, 3 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information about goodwill and intangible assets.
legal and regulatory contingencies in the normal course of business, we have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our activities as a global diversified financial services institution.
certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. in some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress.
we are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business and involving, among other matters, sales and trading activities, wealth and investment management services, financial products or offerings sponsored, underwritten or sold by us, and accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.
accruals for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on a case-by-case basis. where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and we can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, we accrue the estimated loss by a charge to income. in many proceedings, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss.
for certain legal proceedings and investigations, we can estimate possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued. for certain other legal proceedings and investigations, we cannot reasonably estimate such losses, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question.
significant judgment is required in deciding when and if to make these accruals, and the actual cost of a legal claim or regulatory fine/penalty may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals.
see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information on legal proceedings.
managements discussion and analysis tax jurisdictions. disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. we periodically evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each taxing jurisdiction resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and unrecognized tax benefits related to potential losses that may arise from tax audits are established in accordance with the guidance on accounting for unrecognized tax benefits. once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change.
our provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. our deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. our deferred tax balances also include deferred assets related to tax attribute carryforwards, such as net operating losses and tax credits that will be realized through reduction of future tax liabilities and, in some cases, are subject to expiration if not utilized within certain periods. we perform regular reviews to ascertain whether deferred tax assets are realizable. these reviews include managements estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income and incorporate various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to tax attribute carryforwards before they expire. once the deferred tax asset balances have been determined, we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset balances to reflect the amount of these balances (net of valuation allowance) that we estimate it is more likely than not to realize at a future date. both current and deferred income taxes could reflect adjustments related to our unrecognized tax benefits.
significant judgment is required in estimating the consolidated provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including valuation allowance, if any), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. revisions in estimates and/or the actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any.
see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information on our significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes and note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information on our tax examinations.
57      december 2016 form 10-k managements discussion and analysis liquidity and capital resources senior management establishes liquidity and capital policies. through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. the treasury department, firm risk committee, asset and liability management committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our consolidated balance sheets, liquidity and capital structure. liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the board and the boards risk committee.
the balance sheet we monitor and evaluate the composition and size of our balance sheet on a regular basis. our balance sheet management process includes quarterly planning, business-specific thresholds, monitoring of business-specific usage versus key performance metrics and new business impact assessments.
we establish balance sheet thresholds at the consolidated, business segment and business unit levels. we monitor balance sheet utilization and review variances resulting from business activity or market fluctuations. on a regular basis, we review current performance versus established thresholds and assess the need to re-allocate our balance sheet based on business unit needs. we also monitor key metrics, including asset and liability size and capital usage.

a substantial portion of total assets consists of liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from sales and trading activities in the institutional securities business segment. total assets increased to $815 billion at december 31, 2016 from $787 billion at december 31, 2015, primarily due to increases in trading assets within institutional securities, including increases in highly liquid u.s. government and agency securities and corporate equities. these increases were partially offset by a reduction in securities borrowed driven by a decrease in trading liabilities. cash and cash equivalent balances resulting from bank deposits continued to be redeployed into investment securities and lending activity primarily within the wealth management business segment.
securities repurchase agreements and securities lending securities borrowed or securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financings (see notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8).

customer securities financing the customer receivable portion of the securities financing transactions primarily includes customer margin loans, collateralized by customer-owned securities, which are segregated in accordance with regulatory requirements. the customer payable portion of the securities financing transactions primarily includes payables to our prime brokerage customers. our risk exposure on these transactions is mitigated by collateral maintenance policies that limit our credit exposure to customers and liquidity reserves held against this risk exposure.
liquidity risk management framework the primary goal of our liquidity risk management framework is to ensure that we have access to adequate funding across a wide range of market conditions and time horizons. the framework is designed to enable us to fulfill our financial obligations and support the execution of our business strategies.
the following principles guide our liquidity risk management framework:
   sufficient liquid assets should be maintained to cover maturing liabilities and other planned and contingent outflows;
   maturity profile of assets and liabilities should be aligned, with limited reliance on short-term funding;
   liquidity stress tests should anticipate, and account for, periods of limited access to funding.
the core components of our liquidity risk management framework are the required liquidity framework, liquidity stress tests and the global liquidity reserve (as defined below), which support our target liquidity profile.
required liquidity framework our required liquidity framework reflects the amount of liquidity we must hold in both normal and stressed environments to ensure that our financial condition and overall soundness are not adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet our financial obligations in a timely manner. the required liquidity framework considers the most constraining liquidity requirement to satisfy all regulatory and internal limits at a consolidated and legal entity level.
liquidity stress tests we use liquidity stress tests to model external and intercompany liquidity flows across multiple scenarios and a range of time horizons. these scenarios contain various combinations of idiosyncratic and systemic stress events of different severity and duration. the methodology, implementation, production and analysis of our liquidity stress tests are important components of the required liquidity framework.
the scenarios or assumptions used by us in our liquidity stress tests include, but are not limited to, the following:
   no government support;
   no access to equity and unsecured debt markets;
   repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within the stress horizon;
   higher haircuts for and significantly lower availability of secured funding;
   additional collateral that would be required by trading counterparties, certain exchanges and clearing organizations related to credit rating downgrades;
   additional collateral that would be required due to collateral substitutions, collateral disputes and uncalled collateral;
   drawdowns on lending commitments provided to third parties;
59      december 2016 form 10-k managements discussion and analysis
   client cash withdrawals and reduction in customer short positions that fund long positions;
   limited access to the foreign exchange swap markets; and
   maturity roll-off of outstanding letters of credit with no further issuance.
liquidity stress tests are produced for the parent company and major operating subsidiaries, as well as at major currency levels, to capture specific cash requirements and cash availability across the firm, including a limited number of asset sales in a stressed environment. the liquidity stress tests assume that subsidiaries will use their own liquidity first to fund their obligations before drawing liquidity from the parent company and that the parent company will support its subsidiaries and will not have access to subsidiaries liquidity reserves. in addition to the assumptions underpinning the liquidity stress tests, we take into consideration settlement risk related to intraday settlement and clearing of securities and financing activities.
at december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, we maintained sufficient liquidity to meet current and contingent funding obligations as modeled in our liquidity stress tests.
global liquidity reserve we maintain sufficient liquidity reserves to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets sized by the required liquidity framework and liquidity stress tests. the size of the global liquidity reserve is actively managed by us considering the following components: unsecured debt maturity profile; balance sheet size and composition; funding needs in a stressed environment, inclusive of contingent cash outflows; legal entity, regional and segment liquidity requirements; regulatory requirements; and collateral requirements. in addition, our global liquidity reserve includes a discretionary surplus based on risk tolerance and is subject to change dependent on market and firm-specific events. the global liquidity reserve is held within the parent company and its major operating subsidiaries.

regulatory liquidity framework liquidity coverage ratio the basel committee on banking supervisions (basel committee) liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) standard is designed to ensure that banking organizations have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover net cash outflows arising from significant stress over 30 calendar days. the standards objective is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banking organizations.
we and our u.s. bank subsidiaries are subject to the lcr requirements issued by u.s. banking regulators (u.s. lcr), which are based on the basel committees lcr, including a requirement to calculate each entitys u.s. lcr on each business day. as of january 1, 2017, we and our u.s. bank subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum of 100% of the fully phased-in u.s. lcr. in addition, effective april 1, 2017, we will be required to disclose certain quantitative and qualitative information related to our u.s. lcr calculation after each calendar quarter. we and our u.s. bank subsidiaries are compliant with the minimum required u.s. lcr based on current interpretations.
net stable funding ratio the objective of the net stable funding ratio (nsfr) is to reduce funding risk over a one-year horizon by requiring banking organizations to fund their activities with sufficiently stable sources of funding in order to mitigate the risk of future funding stress.
managements discussion and analysis the basel committee finalized the nsfr framework in 2014. in may 2016, the u.s. banking regulators issued a proposal to implement the nsfr in the u.s. the proposal would require a covered company to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is measured with reference to sources of funding, including deposit and debt liabilities, that is no less than the amount of its required stable funding, which is measured by applying standardized weightings to its assets, derivatives exposures and certain other items.
if adopted as proposed, the requirements would apply to us and our u.s. bank subsidiaries beginning january 1, 2018. we continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposal, which is subject to further rulemaking procedures following the closing of the public comment period. our preliminary estimates, based on the current proposal, indicate that actions will be necessary to meet the requirement, which we expect to accomplish by the effective date of the final rule. our preliminary estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results based on the final rule to differ materially from estimates. for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results, see risk factors in part i, item 1a.
funding management we manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to our operations. we pursue a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed.
we fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. these sources may include our equity capital, long-term borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements), securities lending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. we have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies.
secured financing a substantial portion of our total assets consist of liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from sales and trading activities in the institutional securities business. the liquid nature of these assets provides us with flexibility in managing the composition and size of our balance sheet. our goal is to achieve an optimal mix of durable secured and unsecured financing. secured financing investors principally focus on the quality of the eligible collateral posted. accordingly, we actively manage the secured financing book based on the quality of the assets being funded.
we utilize shorter-term secured financing only for highly liquid assets and have established longer tenor limits for less liquid asset classes, for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption. we define highly liquid assets as government-issued or government-guaranteed securities with a high degree of fundability and less liquid assets as those that do not meet these criteria. at december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, the weighted average maturity of our secured financing of less liquid assets was greater than 120 days. to further minimize the refinancing risk of secured financing for less liquid assets, we have established concentration limits to diversify our investor base and reduce the amount of monthly maturities for secured financing of less liquid assets. furthermore, we obtain term secured funding liabilities in excess of less liquid inventory as an additional risk mitigant to replace maturing trades in the event that secured financing markets, or our ability to access them, become limited. as a component of the liquidity risk management framework, we hold a portion of our global liquidity reserve against the potential disruption to our secured financing capabilities.
we also maintain a pool of liquid and easily fundable securities, which provide a valuable future source of liquidity. with the implementation of liquidity standards, we have also incorporated high-quality liquid asset classifications that are consistent with the u.s. lcr definitions into our encumbrance reporting, which further substantiates the demonstrated liquidity characteristics of the unencumbered asset pool and our ability to readily identify new funding sources for such assets.
unsecured financing we view long-term debt and deposits as stable sources of funding. unencumbered securities and non-security assets are financed with a combination of long-term and short-term debt and deposits. our unsecured financings include structured borrowings, whose payments and redemption values are based on the performance of certain underlying assets, including equity, credit, foreign exchange, interest rates and commodities. when appropriate, we may use derivative products to conduct asset and liability management and to make adjustments to our interest rate and structured borrowings risk profile (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8).
deposits available funding sources to our u.s. bank subsidiaries include demand deposit accounts, money market deposit accounts, time deposits, repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased and federal home loan bank advances. the vast majority of deposits in our u.s. bank subsidiaries are
61      december 2016 form 10-k managements discussion and analysis sourced from our retail brokerage accounts and are considered to have stable, low-cost funding characteristics. at december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, deposits were $155,863 million and $156,034 million, respectively (see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8).
short-term borrowings our unsecured short-term borrowings may primarily consist of structured notes, bank loans and bank notes with original maturities of 12 months or less. at december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, we had approximately $941 million and $2,173 million, respectively, in short-term borrowings.
long-term borrowings we believe that accessing debt investors through multiple distribution channels helps provide consistent access to the unsecured markets. in addition, the issuance of long-term borrowings allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments. long-term borrowings are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types. availability and cost of financing to us can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit.
we may engage in various transactions in the credit markets (including, for example, debt retirements) that we believe are in our investors best interests.
long-term borrowings by maturity profile
subsequent to december 31, 2016 and through february 21, 2017, long-term borrowings increased by approximately $7.1 billion, net of maturities. this amount includes the issuances of senior debt; $7.0 billion on january 20, 2017 and $3.0 billion on february 17, 2017.
trust preferred securities during 2016, morgan stanley capital trust iii, morgan stanley capital trust iv, morgan stanley capital trust v and morgan stanley capital trust viii redeemed all of their issued and outstanding capital securities pursuant to the optional redemption provisions provided in the respective governing documents. in the aggregate, $2.8 billion was redeemed. we concurrently redeemed the related underlying junior subordinated debentures.
for further information on long-term borrowings, see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8.
credit ratings we rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our day-to-day operations. the cost and availability of financing generally are impacted by our credit ratings, among other things. in addition, our credit ratings can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as otc derivative transactions, including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps. rating agencies consider company-specific factors; other industry factors such as regulatory or legislative changes and the macroeconomic environment, among other things.
our credit ratings do not include any uplift from perceived government support from any rating agency given the significant progress of the u.s. financial reform legislation and regulations. meanwhile, some rating agencies have stated that they currently incorporate various degrees of credit rating uplift from non-governmental third-party sources of potential support.

managements discussion and analysis additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties or pledge additional collateral to certain exchanges and clearing organizations in the event of a future credit rating downgrade irrespective of whether we are in a net asset or net liability position.
the additional collateral or termination payments that may be called in the event of a future credit rating downgrade vary by contract and can be based on ratings by either or both of moodys investors service, inc. (moodys) and standard & poors global ratings (s&p). the following table shows the future potential collateral amounts and termination payments that could be called or required by counterparties or exchanges and clearing organizations in the event of one-notch or two-notch downgrade scenarios, from the lowest of moodys or s&p ratings, based on the relevant contractual downgrade triggers.
downgrade while certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions, the impact it would have on our business and results of operations in future periods is inherently uncertain and would depend on a number of interrelated factors, including, among others, the magnitude of the downgrade, the rating relative to peers, the rating assigned by the relevant agency pre-downgrade, individual client behavior and future mitigating actions we might take. the liquidity impact of additional collateral requirements is included in our liquidity stress tests.
capital management we view capital as an important source of financial strength and actively manage our consolidated capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, risks, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines and, therefore, in the future may expand or contract our capital base to address the changing needs of our businesses. we attempt to maintain total capital, on a consolidated basis, at least equal to the sum of our operating subsidiaries required equity.
common stock we repurchased approximately $3,500 million of our outstanding common stock as part of our share repurchase program during 2016 and $2,125 million during 2015 (see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8). pursuant to the share repurchase program, we consider, among other things, business segment capital needs, as well as stock-based compensation and benefit plan requirements. share repurchases under our program will be exercised from time to time at prices we deem appropriate subject to various factors, including our capital position and market conditions. the share repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through rule 10b5-1 plans, and may be suspended at any time. share repurchases by us are subject to regulatory approval (see market for registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities in part ii, item 5).

1.                    tangible morgan stanley shareholders equity and tangible common equity are non-gaap financial measures that we and investors consider to be a useful measure to assess capital adequacy.
regulatory requirements regulatory capital framework we are a financial holding company under the bank holding company act of 1956, as amended (the bhc act), and are subject to the regulation and oversight of the board of governors of the federal reserve system (the federal reserve). the federal reserve establishes capital requirements for us, including well-capitalized standards, and evaluates our compliance with such capital requirements. the office of the comptroller of the currency (occ) establishes similar capital requirements and standards for our u.s. bank subsidiaries. the regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the basel iii capital standards established by the basel committee and also implement certain provisions of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the dodd-frank act).
the basel committee has recently published revisions to certain standards in its capital framework, including with respect to counterparty credit risk exposures in derivatives transactions, market risk, interest rate risk in the banking book, and securitization capital standards, although these revisions have not yet been adopted by the u.s. banking agencies. in addition, the basel committee is actively considering other potential revisions to other capital standards that would substantially change the framework. the impact on us of any revisions to the basel committees capital standards could be substantial but is uncertain and depends on future rulemakings by the u.s. banking agencies.
managements discussion and analysis regulatory capital requirements we are required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage capital ratios under the regulatory capital requirements. a summary of the calculations of regulatory capital, risk-weighted assets (rwas) and transition provisions follows.
regulatory capital. minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital. certain adjustments to and deductions from capital are required for purposes of determining these ratios, such as goodwill, intangibles, certain deferred tax assets, other amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (aoci) and investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions. certain of these adjustments and deductions are also subject to transitional provisions.
in addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements, on a fully phased-in basis by 2019, we will be subject to:
   a greater than 2.5% common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer;
   the common equity tier 1 global systemically important bank
(g-sib) capital surcharge, currently at 3%; and
   up to a 2.5% common equity tier 1 countercyclical capital buffer (ccyb), currently set by banking regulators at zero (collectively, the buffers).
in 2017, the phase-in amount for each of the buffers is 50% of the fully phased-in buffer requirement. failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. for a further discussion of the g-sib capital surcharge, see g-sib capital surcharge herein.
risk-weighted assets. rwas reflect both our on- and off-balance sheet risk as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following:
   credit risk: the failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligations to us;
   market risk: adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, implied volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and
   operational risk: inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or from external events
(e.g., fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets).
for a further discussion of our market, credit and operational risks, see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a.
our binding risk-based capital ratios for regulatory purposes are the lower of the capital ratios computed under (i) the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk rwas (the standardized approach) and (ii) the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk rwas (the advanced approach). at december 31, 2016, our binding ratios are based on the advanced approach transitional rules.
the methods for calculating each of our risk-based capital ratios will change through january 1, 2022 as aspects of the capital rules are phased in. these changes may result in differences in our reported capital ratios from one reporting period to the next that are independent of changes to our capital base, asset composition, off-balance sheet exposures or risk profile.

the fully phased-in pro forma estimates in the previous tables are based on our current understanding of the capital rules and other factors, which may be subject to change as we receive additional clarification and implementation guidance from the federal reserve and as the interpretation of the regulations evolves over time. these fully phased-in pro forma estimates are non-gaap financial measures that we consider to be useful measures for us, investors and analysts in evaluating compliance with new regulatory capital requirements that were not yet effective at december 31, 2016. these preliminary estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially and should not be taken as a projection of what our capital, capital ratios, rwas, earnings or other results will actually be at future dates. for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results, see risk factors in part i, item 1a.
well-capitalized minimum regulatory capital ratios for u.s. bank subsidiaries at december 31, 2016
common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio                      6.5%
tier 1 risk-based capital ratio                                    8.0%
total risk-based capital ratio                                    10.0%
tier 1 leverage ratio                                              5.0%
for us to remain a financial holding company, our u.s. bank subsidiaries must qualify as well-capitalized by maintaining the minimum ratio requirements set forth in the previous table. the federal reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for financial holding companies to reflect the higher capital standards required for us under the capital rules. assuming that the federal reserve would apply the same or very similar well-capitalized standards to financial holding companies, each of our risk-based capital ratios and tier 1 leverage ratio at december 31, 2016 would have exceeded the revised well-capitalized standard. the federal reserve may require us to maintain risk- and leverage-based capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a financial holding companys particular condition, risk profile and growth plans.

based on our current understanding of the rules and other factors, we estimate our pro forma fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio to be approximately 6.2% at december 31, 2016 and 5.8% at december 31, 2015. these estimates utilize a fully phased-in tier 1 capital numerator and a fully phased-in denominator of approximately $1,061.5 billion at december 31, 2016 and $1,095.6 billion at december 31, 2015, which takes into consideration the tier 1 capital deductions that would be applicable in 2018 after the phase-in period has ended.

the pro forma supplementary leverage exposures and pro forma supplementary leverage ratios, both on transitional and fully phased-in bases, are non-gaap financial measures that we consider to be useful measures for us, investors and analysts in evaluating prospective compliance with new regulatory capital requirements that have not yet become effective. our estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from estimates based on these regulations. further, these expectations should not be taken as projections of what our supplementary leverage ratios, earnings, assets or exposures will actually be at future dates. for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results, see risk factors in part i, item 1a.
69      december 2016 form 10-k managements discussion and analysis g-sib capital surcharge we and other u.s. g-sibs are subject to a risk-based capital surcharge. a g-sib must calculate its g-sib capital surcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges. the first method considers the g-sibs size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability and complexity, which is generally consistent with the methodology developed by the basel committee (method 1). the second method uses similar inputs, but replaces substitutability with the use of short-term wholesale funding (method 2) and generally results in higher surcharges than the first method. the g-sib capital surcharge must be satisfied using common equity tier 1 capital and functions as an extension of the capital conservation buffer. our current g-sib surcharge is 3%. the surcharge is being phased in between january 1, 2016 and january 1, 2019, and the phase-in amount for 2017 is 50% of the applicable surcharge (see minimum risk-based capital ratios: transitional provisions herein).
total loss-absorbing capacity, long-term debt and clean holding company requirements on december 15, 2016, the federal reserve adopted a final rule for top-tier bank holding companies of u.s. g-sibs (covered bhcs), including the parent company, that establishes external tlac, long-term debt (ltd) and clean holding company requirements. the final rule contains various definitions and restrictions, such as requiring eligible ltd to be issued by the covered bhc and be unsecured, have a maturity of one year or more from the date of issuance and not have certain derivative-linked features, typically associated with certain types of structured notes. covered bhcs must comply with all requirements under the rule by january 1, 2019, which we expect to accomplish.
the main purpose of the federal reserves minimum external tlac and ltd requirements is to ensure that covered bhcs, including the parent company, will have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of eligible ltd to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible ltd or other forms of tlac where a single point of entry (spoe) resolution strategy is used (see businesssupervision and regulationfinancial holding companyresolution and recovery planning in part i, item 1 and risk factorslegal, regulatory and compliance risk in part i, item 1a).
under the final rule, a covered bhc is required to maintain minimum external tlac equal to the greater of 18% of total rwas and 7.5% of its total leverage exposure (the denominator of its supplementary leverage ratio). in addition, covered bhcs must meet a separate external ltd requirement equal to the greater of 6% of total rwas plus the greater of the method 1 and method 2 g-sib capital surcharge applicable to the parent company and 4.5% of its total leverage exposure.
in addition, the final rule imposes tlac buffer requirements on top of both the risk-based and leverage-exposure-based external tlac minimum requirements. the risk-based tlac buffer is equal to the sum of 2.5%, the covered bhcs method 1 g-sib surcharge and the countercyclical capital buffer, if any, as a percentage of total rwas. the leverage-exposure-based tlac buffer is equal to 2% of the covered bhcs total leverage exposure. failure to maintain the tlac buffers would result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.
the final rule provides permanent grandfathering for debt instruments issued prior to december 31, 2016 that would be eligible ltd but for having impermissible acceleration clauses or being governed by foreign law.
furthermore, under the clean holding company requirements of the final rule, a covered bhc is prohibited from incurring any external short-term debt or certain other liabilities, regardless of whether the liabilities are fully secured or otherwise senior to eligible ltd, or entering into certain other prohibited transactions. certain other external liabilities, including structured notes, are subject to a cap equal to 5% of the covered bhcs outstanding external tlac amount.
capital plans and stress tests pursuant to the dodd-frank act, the federal reserve has adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large bank holding companies, including us, which form part of the federal reserves annual comprehensive capital analysis and review (ccar) framework.
we must submit an annual capital plan to the federal reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by us and the federal reserve, so that the federal reserve may assess our systems and processes that incorporate forward-looking projections of revenues and losses to monitor and maintain our internal capital adequacy.
managements discussion and analysis addition, the federal reserve has issued guidance setting out its heightened expectations for capital planning practices at certain large financial institutions, including us.
in november 2015, the federal reserve amended its capital plan and stress test rules to delay until 2017 the use of the supplementary leverage ratio requirement, defer indefinitely the use of the advanced approach risk-based capital framework in capital planning and company-run stress tests, and incorporate the tier 1 capital deductions for certain investments in volcker rule covered funds into the pro forma minimum capital requirements for capital plan and stress testing purposes.
the capital plan rule requires that large bank holding companies receive no objection from the federal reserve before making a capital distribution. in addition, even with an approved capital plan, the bank holding company must seek the approval of the federal reserve before making a capital distribution if, among other reasons, the bank holding company would not meet its regulatory capital requirements after making the proposed capital distribution. a bank holding companys ability to make capital distributions (other than scheduled payments on additional tier 1 and tier 2 capital instruments) is also limited if its net capital issuances are less than the amount indicated in its capital plan.
in addition, we must conduct semiannual company-run stress tests and are subject to an annual dodd-frank act supervisory stress test conducted by the federal reserve.
on april 5, 2016, we submitted our 2016 ccar capital plan, and summary results of the ccar and dodd-frank act supervisory stress tests were published by the federal reserve in june. we exceeded all stressed capital ratio minimum requirements in the federal reserve severely adverse scenario, and our quantitative capital results improved from our prior-year submission. in june 2016, we received a conditional non-objection from the federal reserve to our 2016 capital plan (see capital management herein). on december 29, 2016, we resubmitted our capital plan, as required by the federal reserve, to address weaknesses identified in our capital planning process.
future capital distributions may be restricted if these identified weaknesses are not satisfactorily addressed when the federal reserve reviews our resubmitted capital plan. pursuant to the conditional non-objection, we are able to execute the capital actions set forth in our 2016 capital plan, which included increasing our common stock dividend to $0.20 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2016 and executing share repurchases of $3.5 billion during the period july 1, 2016 through june 30, 2017. in addition, we submitted the results of our mid-cycle company-run stress test to the federal reserve on october 5, 2016, and we disclosed a summary of the results on october 31, 2016.
for the 2017 capital planning and stress test cycle, we are required to submit our capital plan and company-run stress test results to the federal reserve by april 5, 2017. we expect that the federal reserve will provide its response to our 2017 capital plan by june 30, 2017. the federal reserve is expected to publish summary results of the ccar and dodd-frank act supervisory stress tests of each large bank holding company, including us, by june 30, 2017. we are required to disclose a summary of the results of our company-run stress tests within 15 days of the date the federal reserve discloses the results of the supervisory stress tests. in addition, we must submit the results of our mid-cycle company-run stress test to the federal reserve by october 5, 2017 and disclose a summary of the results between october 5, 2017 and november 4, 2017.
in january 2017, the federal reserve adopted revisions to the capital plan and stress test rules that, among other things, reduce the de minimis threshold for additional capital distributions that a firm may make during a capital plan cycle without seeking the federal reserves prior approval. the final rule also establishes a blackout period beginning in march of each year while the federal reserve is conducting ccar reviews during which firms are not permitted to submit de minimis exception notices or prior approval requests for additional capital distributions. the federal reserve is currently considering making further changes to ccar requirements, which may increase minimum capital requirements for the firm.
the dodd-frank act also requires each of our u.s. bank subsidiaries to conduct an annual stress test. msbna and mspbna submitted their 2016 annual company-run stress tests to the occ on april 5, 2016 and published a summary of their stress test results on june 23, 2016. for the 2017 stress test cycle, msbna and mspbna must submit their 2017 annual company-run stress tests to the occ by april 5, 2017 and publish the summary results between june 15, 2017 and july 15, 2017.
attribution of average common equity according to the required capital framework our required capital (required capital) estimation is based on the required capital framework, an internal capital adequacy measure. common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated by the required capital framework, as well as each business segments relative contribution to our total required capital. required capital is assessed for each business segment and further attributed to product lines. this process is intended to align capital with the
71      december 2016 form 10-k managements discussion and analysis risks in each business segment in order to allow senior management to evaluate returns on a risk-adjusted basis.
the required capital framework is a risk-based and leverage use-of-capital measure, which is compared with our regulatory capital to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from stress events, where applicable, at a point in time. we define the difference between our total average common equity and the sum of the average common equity amounts allocated to our business segments as parent company equity. we generally hold parent company equity for prospective regulatory requirements, organic growth, acquisitions and other capital needs.
effective january 1, 2016, the common equity estimation and attribution to the business segments are based on our pro forma fully phased-in regulatory capital, including supplementary leverage and stress losses (which results in more capital being attributed to the business segments), whereas prior periods were attributed based on transitional regulatory capital provisions. also, beginning in 2016, the amount of capital allocated to the business segments will be set at the beginning of each year and will remain fixed throughout the year until the next annual reset. differences between available and required capital will be attributed to parent company equity during the year. periods prior to 2016 have not been recast under this new methodology.
the required capital framework is expected to evolve over time in response to changes in the business and regulatory environment, for example, to incorporate stress testing or enhancements in modeling techniques. we will continue to evaluate the framework with respect to the impact of future regulatory requirements, as appropriate.

regulatory developments resolution and recovery planning pursuant to the dodd-frank act, we are required to submit to the federal reserve and the federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic) an annual resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the u.s. bankruptcy code in the event of our material financial distress or failure.
our preferred resolution strategy, which is set out in our 2015 resolution plan, is an spoe strategy. on september 30, 2016, we submitted a status report to the federal reserve and the fdic in respect of certain shortcomings identified in our 2015 resolution plan. pursuant to the status report, we indicated that the parent company will amend and restate its support agreement with its material subsidiaries that is designed to ensure that such subsidiaries have sufficient capital and liquidity as and when needed throughout a resolution scenario.
under the amended and restated support agreement, upon the occurrence of a resolution scenario, the parent company will be obligated to contribute or loan on a subordinated basis all of its material assets, other than shares in subsidiaries of the parent company and certain intercompany receivables, to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to our material subsidiaries.
the obligations of the parent company under the amended and restated support agreement will be secured on a senior basis by the assets of the parent company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the parent company). as a result, claims of our material subsidiaries against the assets of the parent company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the parent company) will be effectively senior to unsecured obligations of the parent company.
our next full resolution plan submission will be on july 1, 2017. if the federal reserve and the fdic were to jointly determine that our 2017 resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution, and if we were unable to address any deficiencies identified by the regulators, we or any of our subsidiaries may be subject to more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations, or, after a two-year period, we may be required to divest assets or operations.
in september 2016, the occ issued final guidelines that establish enforceable standards for recovery planning by national banks and certain other institutions with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, calculated on a rolling four-quarter average basis, including msbna. the guidelines were effective on january 1, 2017, and msbna must be in compliance by january 1, 2018.
managements discussion and analysis including us, and their subsidiaries are parties. in august 2016, the occ proposed a rule that would subject national banks that are subsidiaries of u.s. g-sibs, including our u.s. bank subsidiaries, as well as certain other institutions (collectively with u.s. g-sibs and their other subsidiaries, covered entities), to substantively identical requirements.
under the proposals, covered qfcs must expressly provide that transfer restrictions and default rights against a covered entity are limited to the same extent as provided under the federal deposit insurance act and title ii of the dodd-frank act and their implementing regulations. in addition, covered qfcs may not permit the exercise of cross-default rights against a covered entity based on an affiliates entry into insolvency, resolution or similar proceedings. if adopted as proposed, the requirements would take effect at the start of the first calendar quarter that begins at least one year after the final rules are issued. we continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposals, which are subject to public comment and further rulemaking procedures.
for more information about resolution and recovery planning requirements and our activities in these areas, see businesssupervision and regulationfinancial holding companyresolution and recovery planning in part i, item 1.
legacy covered funds under the volcker rule the volcker rule prohibits banking entities, including us and our affiliates, from engaging in certain proprietary trading activities, as defined in the volcker rule, subject to exemptions for underwriting, market-making-related activities, risk-mitigating hedging and certain other activities. the volcker rule also prohibits certain investments and relationships by banking entities with covered funds, with a number of exemptions and exclusions.
banking entities were required to bring all of their activities and investments into conformance with the volcker rule by july 21, 2015, subject to certain extensions. the federal reserve has extended the conformance period until july 21, 2017 for investments in, and relationships with, covered funds that were in place before december 31, 2013, referred to as legacy covered funds. the volcker rule also permits the federal reserve to provide an additional transition period of up to five years for banking entities to conform investments in certain legacy covered funds that are also illiquid funds.
on december 12, 2016, the federal reserve issued a policy statement with information about how banking entities may seek this further statutory extension. additionally, the federal reserve stated that it expects the illiquid funds of banking entities to generally qualify for extensions, although they may not be granted if the banking entity has not demonstrated meaningful progress to conform or divest its illiquid funds, or has a deficient compliance program under the volcker rule, or if the federal reserve has concerns about evasion. we submitted our application for illiquid funds extension in january 2017, covering essentially all of our approximately $1.9 billion of non-conforming investments in, and relationships with, legacy covered funds subject to the volcker rule.
off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off-balance sheet arrangements we enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements, including through unconsolidated special purpose entities (spes) and lending-related financial instruments (e.g., guarantees and commitments), primarily in connection with the institutional securities and investment management business segments.
we utilize spes primarily in connection with securitization activities. for information on our securitization activities, see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8.
for information on our commitments, obligations under certain guarantee arrangements and indemnities, see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8. for further information on our lending commitments, see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskrisk managementcredit risklending activities in item 7a.
contractual obligations in the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. contractual obligations include long-term borrowings, other secured financings, contractual interest payments, contractual payments on time deposits, operating leases and purchase obligations.

6.   amounts exclude unrecognized tax benefits, as the timing and amount of future cash payments are not determinable at this time (see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further information).
effects of inflation and changes in interest and foreign exchange rates to the extent that an increased inflation outlook results in rising interest rates or has negative impacts on the valuation of financial instruments that exceed the impact on the value of our liabilities, it may adversely affect our financial position and profitability. rising inflation may also result in increases in our non-interest expenses that may not be readily recoverable in higher prices of services offered. other changes in the interest rate environment and related volatility as well as expectations about the level of future interest rates could also impact our results of operations.
a significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar, therefore, can affect the value of non-u.s. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored, and, where cost-justified, strategies are adopted that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on our financial performance. these strategies may include the financing of non-u.s. dollar assets with direct or swap-based borrowings in the same currency and the use of currency forward contracts or the spot market in various hedging transactions related to net assets, revenues, expenses or cash flows. for information about cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8.

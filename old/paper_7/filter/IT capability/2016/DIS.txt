revenues for fiscal 2016 increased 6%, or $3.2 billion, to $55.6 billion; net income attributable to disney increased 12%, or $1.0 billion, to $9.4 billion; and diluted earnings per share attributable to disney (eps) for the year increased 17%, or $0.83 to $5.73. the eps increase in fiscal 2016 was due to segment operating income growth driven by studio entertainment, parks and resorts and consumer products & interactive media, a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program, a decrease in our effective income tax rate, which reflected a deferred tax asset write-off in the prior year, and the benefit of the vice gain (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). these increases were partially offset by higher net interest expense, the infinity charge (see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements) and higher restructuring and impairment charges in the current year. segment operating results benefited from growth in services, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation due to the movement of the u.s. dollar against major currencies including the impact of our hedging program (fx impact).
fiscal 2016 included fifty-two weeks of operations, while fiscal 2015 results included the benefit from a fifty-third week of operations (fiscal period impact) due to the timing of our fiscal period end. the estimated eps impact of the additional week of operations in the prior year was approximately $0.13 and the majority of the impact was at our cable networks business, followed by our parks and resorts and, to a lesser extent, consumer products businesses.
revenues service revenues for fiscal 2016 increased 7%, or $3.2 billion, to $47.1 billion, due to higher theatrical distribution revenues. the increase in service revenue was also driven by higher merchandise and game licensing revenue, average guest spending and attendance growth at our domestic parks and resorts, higher affiliate fees, growth in tv/ subscription video on demand (svod), revenues from the opening of shanghai disney resort, growth in digital distribution of film content and higher advertising revenue. these increases were partially offset by lower attendance at disneyland paris. service revenue growth reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to an unfavorable fx impact.
product revenues for fiscal 2016 decreased 1%, or $69 million, to $8.5 billion, due to the discontinuation of the infinity business and lower retail store volumes, partially offset by higher average guest spending at our domestic parks and resorts, higher net effective pricing at home entertainment and revenues from the opening of shanghai disney resort. lower product revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decline due to an unfavorable fx impact.
costs and expenses cost of services for fiscal 2016 increased 6%, or $1.5 billion, to $24.7 billion, due to higher film cost amortization and distribution expense, increased media programming and production costs, the impact of the opening of shanghai disney resort and cost inflation and higher infrastructure and labor costs at our domestic parks and resorts. these increases were partially offset by efficiency initiatives at our domestic parks and resorts. cost of services reflected an approximate 1 percentage point benefit due to a favorable fx impact.
table of contents cost of products for fiscal 2016 increased 3%, or $167 million, to $5.3 billion, due to the infinity charge, higher guest spending and cost inflation at our domestic parks and resorts and higher film cost amortization due to home entertainment revenue growth, partially offset by lower costs from the discontinuation of the infinity business.
selling, general, administrative and other costs for the fiscal year increased 3%, or $231 million, to $8.8 billion, driven by increased marketing costs at our studio entertainment segment, partially offset by lower marketing spend at our media networks segment. selling, general, administrative and other costs reflected an approximate 1 percentage point benefit due to a favorable fx impact.
depreciation and amortization costs increased 7%, or $173 million, to $2.5 billion due to the opening of shanghai disney resort and depreciation of new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts.
restructuring and impairment charges the company recorded $156 million and $53 million of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. charges in fiscal 2016 were due to asset impairments and severance and contract termination costs. charges in fiscal 2015 were primarily due to a contract termination and severance costs.

interest and investment income            94               148       (36        )%
the increase in interest expense was due to higher average debt balances and an increase in our effective interest rate, partially offset by higher capitalized interest.
the decrease in interest and investment income was due to lower gains on sales of publicly traded investments.
equity in the income of investees equity in the income of investees increased 14% or $112 million, to $0.9 billion due to the $332 million vice gain (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). the benefit of the vice gain was partially offset by a higher loss at hulu and lower operating results at a+e. the increased equity loss at hulu was due to higher programming, marketing and labor costs, partially offset by growth in subscription and advertising revenues. the decrease at a+e was due to lower advertising revenue and the impact of the conversion of the h2 channel to viceland.

revenues service revenues for fiscal 2015 increased 9%, or $3.7 billion, to $43.9 billion, primarily due to higher affiliate fees, volume growth and higher average guest spending at our domestic parks and resorts, higher svod sales of our television and film properties, an increase in merchandise licensing and advertising revenue growth. service revenue growth reflected an approximate 2 percentage point decrease due to an unfavorable fx impact.
product revenues for fiscal 2015 were comparable to fiscal 2014 as higher food, beverage and merchandise volumes and average guest spending at our domestic parks and resorts and increased revenues at our retail business were offset by lower worldwide home entertainment and console game volumes. product revenue growth reflected an approximate 2 percentage point decrease due to an unfavorable fx impact.
costs and expenses cost of services for fiscal 2015 increased 9%, or $1.8 billion, to $23.2 billion primarily due to higher sports programming costs and inflation and operations support cost growth at our domestic parks and resorts. cost of services reflected an approximate 1 percentage point benefit due to a favorable fx impact.
cost of products for fiscal 2015 increased 2%, or $109 million, to $5.2 billion, driven by volume growth at domestic parks and resorts and our retail business and inflation at our domestic parks and resorts. these increases were partially offset by lower home entertainment and console game unit sales. cost of products reflected an approximate 2 percentage point benefit due to a favorable fx impact.

depreciation and amortization costs increased 3%, or $66 million, to $2.4 billion, driven by new theme park attractions and, to a lesser extent, new broadcast facilities and equipment. depreciation and amortization costs reflected an approximate 2 percentage point benefit due to a favorable fx impact.

the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the overall performance of the operating businesses. aggregate segment operating income is not a financial measure defined by gaap, should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant gaap financial measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. the company believes that information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the company's portfolio of businesses separate from factors other than business operations that affect net income. the following table reconciles segment operating income to income before income taxes.

pension and postretirement medical benefit costs pension and postretirement medical benefit plan costs affect results in all of our segments, with approximately 40% of these costs being borne by the parks and resorts segment. the company recognized pension and postretirement medical benefit plan expenses of $319 million, $457 million and $309 million for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the decrease in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a change in our approach to measuring service and interest costs (see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of plan assumptions). this change does not affect the measurement of our plan obligations nor the funded status of our plans.
in fiscal 2017, we expect pension and postretirement medical costs to increase by $68 million to $387 million due to the impact of a lower assumed discount rate, partially offset by higher estimated investment income, which is driven by higher plan assets in fiscal 2017.
in fiscal 2016, the underfunded status of our plans increased from $4.0 billion to $5.2 billion and the unrecognized expense increased from $3.9 billion ($2.5 billion after tax) to $5.8 billion ($3.6 billion after tax) due to a lower assumed discount rate. if discount rates do not increase and/or our future investment returns do not exceed our long-term expected returns, a significant portion of the unrecognized expense will be recognized as a net actuarial loss in our income statement over approximately the next 9 years. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the impacts of our pension and postretirement medical plans on our financial statements.
during fiscal 2016, the company contributed $900 million to its pension and postretirement medical plans. in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we contributed $1.3 billion and do not expect to make any additional material contributions for the remainder of fiscal 2017. however, final minimum funding requirements for fiscal 2017 will be determined based on our january 1, 2017 funding actuarial valuation, which will be available in late fiscal 2017. see "item 1a - risk factors" for the impact of factors affecting pension and postretirement medical costs.

investing activities investing activities consist principally of investments in parks, resorts and other property and acquisition and divestiture activity. the company's investments in parks, resorts and other property for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:
media networks cable networks                                        $86                $127                $172
consumer products &amp; interactive media              53                  87                  48
capital expenditures for the parks and resorts segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion, new attractions, cruise ships, capital improvements and systems infrastructure. the increase at our domestic parks and resorts in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was due to spending on new attractions at walt disney world resort and disneyland resort, while the increase in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was driven by spending on new attractions at walt disney world resort. the decrease in capital expenditures at our international parks and resorts in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was due to lower spending at shanghai disney resort, which opened in june 2016, partially offset by higher spending at hong kong disneyland resort, while the increase in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was due to higher spending for the shanghai disney resort.
capital expenditures at media networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities and television station facilities.
capital expenditures at corporate primarily reflect investments in corporate facilities, information technology infrastructure and equipment.
table of contents the company currently expects its fiscal 2017 capital expenditures will be approximately $0.5 billion higher than fiscal 2016 capital expenditures of $4.8 billion due to increased investments at our domestic parks and resorts partially offset by decreased investments at our international parks and resorts.
other investing activities during fiscal 2016, acquisitions totaled $850 million due to the acquisition of a 15% interest in bamtech and an 11% interest in vice. in addition, the company made $109 million of contributions to joint ventures and investment purchases and paid $74 million in premiums for foreign currency option contracts in connection with our commitment to acquire two new cruise ships.
during fiscal 2015, contributions to joint ventures totaled $151 million and proceeds from the sale of investments and dispositions totaled $166 million.
during fiscal 2014, acquisitions totaled $402 million due to the acquisition of maker studios, and proceeds from the sales of investments and dispositions of assets totaled $395 million.
financing activities cash used in financing activities was $7.0 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $5.5 billion in fiscal 2015. the net use of cash in the current year was due to $7.5 billion of common stock repurchases and $2.3 billion in dividends, partially offset by net borrowings of $2.9 billion.
cash used in financing activities of $7.0 billion was $1.5 billion more than the cash used in fiscal 2015. the increase in cash used in financing activities was driven by:
•   lower contributions from non-controlling interest holders (zero in fiscal 2016 compared to $1.0 billion in fiscal 2015)
•   lower dividend payments of $0.8 billion as a result of moving from an annual dividend to a semi-annual dividend. in fiscal 2015, we paid our full year fiscal year 2014 dividend and the first half of the fiscal 2015 dividend. in the current year, we paid the dividend for the second half of fiscal 2015 and the first half of fiscal 2016.
cash used in financing activities was $5.5 billion in fiscal 2015 compared to $6.7 billion in fiscal 2014. the net use of cash in fiscal 2015 was due to $6.1 billion of common stock repurchases and $3.1 billion in dividends, partially offset by net borrowings of $2.7 billion and contributions from noncontrolling interest holders of $1.0 billion.
cash used in financing activities of $5.5 billion in fiscal 2015 was $1.2 billion lower than cash used in fiscal 2014. the decrease in cash used in financing activities was driven by:
•   higher contributions from non-controlling interest holders ($1.0 billion in fiscal 2015 compared to $0.6 billion in fiscal 2014)
table of contents during the year ended october 1, 2016, the company's borrowing activity was as follows:

(2)   the other activity is primarily the conversion of hong kong disneyland resort debt into equity and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this transaction.
(3)   the other activity is primarily market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges.
see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company's bank facilities. the company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities, in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due.
see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the company's dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014.
we believe that the company's financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. however, the company's operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. see "item 1a - risk factors". in addition to macroeconomic factors, the company's borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the company's performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. as of october 1, 2016, moody's investors service's long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a2 and p-1, respectively, with stable outlook; standard & poor's long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a and a-1, respectively, with stable outlook; and fitch's long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a and f-1, respectively, with stable outlook. the company's bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the company met on october 1, 2016, by a significant margin. the company's bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the international theme parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default.
contractual obligations, commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the company has various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. for example, the company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.
table of contents the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at october 1, 2016 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. in addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings based on their contractual maturities. additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, as referenced in the table:
operating lease commitments (note 14)                              3,106                     477                     705                  505                    1,419

(1)   amounts exclude market value adjustments totaling $146 million, which are recorded in the balance sheet. amounts include interest payments based on contractual terms for fixed rate debt and on current interest rates for variable rate debt. in 2023, the company has the ability to call a debt instrument prior to its scheduled maturity, which if exercised by the company would reduce future interest payments by $1.1 billion.
(2)   other commitments primarily comprise contractual commitments for the construction of two new cruise ships, creative talent and employment agreements and unrecognized tax benefits. creative talent and employment agreements include obligations to actors, producers, sports, television and radio personalities and executives.
(3)   contractual commitments include the following:
liabilities recorded on the balance sheet         $20,807
commitments not recorded on the balance sheet      67,542
the company also has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement medical benefit plans. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
contingent commitments and contractual guarantees see notes 3, 6 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company's contingent commitments and contractual guarantees.
legal and tax matters as disclosed in notes 9 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the company has exposure for certain tax and legal matters.
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. for a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
film and television revenues and costs we expense film and television production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (ultimate revenues) for each production. if our estimate of ultimate revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. conversely, if our estimate of ultimate revenues increases, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. for film productions, ultimate revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release.
table of contents for television series, ultimate revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.
with respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is theatrical performance. revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release (e.g., the home entertainment or television markets) have historically been highly correlated with the theatrical performance. theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. upon a film's release and determination of the theatrical performance, the company's estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for released films is the level of expected home entertainment sales. home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home entertainment products, as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products.
with respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of ultimate revenues are program ratings and the strength of the advertising market. program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the company's ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program. in addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the licensing of program rights worldwide to television distributors, svod services and in home entertainment formats. alternatively, poor ratings may result in cancellation of the program, which would require an immediate write-down of any unamortized production costs. a significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates.
we expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired series, movies and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life, as appropriate. amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. the number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program's ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. we amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. the estimated value of each year is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. if the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season's estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. if planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.
costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments, which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. the net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. the company's dayparts are: primetime, daytime, late night, news and sports (includes broadcast and cable networks). the net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable network. individual programs are written off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program. estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required.
revenue recognition the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies.
we reduce home entertainment and game revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives. these estimates are based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products. if we underestimate the level of returns or sales incentives in a particular period, we may record less revenue in later periods when returns or sales incentives exceed the estimated amount. conversely, if we overestimate the level of returns or sales incentives for a period, we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns or sales incentives are less than estimated.
table of contents usage patterns. if actual usage is different than our estimated usage, revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered. in addition, a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition.
pension and postretirement medical plan actuarial assumptions the company's pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. the guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. we decreased our discount rate to 3.73% at the end of fiscal 2016 from 4.47% at the end of fiscal 2015 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2016 year end measurement date. the company's discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of plans' liability cash flows to the yield curves. a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2017 by approximately $271 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at october 1, 2016 by approximately $2.9 billion. a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $235 million and $2.4 billion, respectively.
to determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. our expected return on plan assets is 7.50%. a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense. a one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2017 annual benefit expense by approximately $123 million.
for fiscal 2016, we changed the approach we used to determine the service and interest cost components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our pension and postretirement medical plans.
goodwill, other intangible assets, long-lived assets and investments the company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment. if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwill.
to determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. the discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. we include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value. these amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results. we believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.
in times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the company's long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.
the company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.
the company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. the impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying value of the asset group. an asset group is established by identifying the lowest
table of contents level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. if the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group's long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group's long-lived assets. the impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. for assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset's fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. if we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.
the company has cost and equity investments. the fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. in assessing the potential impairment of these investments, we consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and market values, where available. if these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value, impairment charges may be required.
the company tested its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, investments and long-lived assets for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $7 million, $10 million and $46 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the fiscal 2014 impairment charges related to radio fcc licenses held by businesses in the media networks segment. the fair values of the radio fcc licenses were derived from market transactions. these impairment charges were recorded in "restructuring and impairment charges" in the consolidated statements of income.
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. in times of domestic or global economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods.
contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings. these estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate. from time to time, we may also be involved in other contingent matters for which we have accrued estimates for a probable and estimable loss. it is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.
income tax audits as a matter of course, the company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. the tax benefits ultimately realized by the company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the company's decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the company's success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.
new accounting pronouncements see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.
forward-looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. we may from time to time make written or oral statements that are "forward-looking," including statements contained in this report and other filings with the sec and in reports to our shareholders. such statements may, for
table of contents example, express expectations or projections about future actions that we may take, including restructuring or strategic initiatives, or about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions. these statements are made on the basis of management's views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements. there can be no assurance, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass. significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under item 1a - risk factors of this report on form 10-k.

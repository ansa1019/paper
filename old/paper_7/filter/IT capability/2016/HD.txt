item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
executive summary and selected consolidated statements of earnings data net sales increased 6.9% to $94.6 billion for the fiscal year ended january 29, 2017 ("fiscal 2016") from $88.5 billion for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2016 ("fiscal 2015"). our total comparable store sales increased 5.6% in fiscal 2016, driven by a 2.8% increase in our comparable store customer transactions and a 2.7% increase in our comparable store average ticket. comparable store sales for our u.s. stores increased 6.2% in fiscal 2016.
for fiscal 2016, we reported net earnings of $8.0 billion and diluted earnings per share of $6.45 compared to net earnings of $7.0 billion and diluted earnings per share of $5.46 for fiscal 2015.
the results for fiscal 2016 included $37 million of pretax expenses related to the data breach that we discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to $128 million of pretax net expenses for fiscal 2015. these charges resulted in decreases of $0.02 and $0.06 to diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. since the data breach occurred, we have recorded $198 million of pretax net expenses related to the data breach. the data breach is discussed further in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
the results for fiscal 2015 included a $144 million pretax gain related to the sale of our remaining equity ownership in hd supply holdings, inc. ("hd supply"). this gain contributed $0.07 to diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015.
in fiscal 2016, we continued to focus on the following:
customer experience - customer experience is anchored on the principles of putting customers first and taking care of our associates, and our commitment to customer service remains strong. we have taken a number of steps to provide our customers with a seamless and frictionless shopping experience in our stores, online, on the job site and in their homes. in fiscal 2016, we rolled out a redesign of our home depot website to provide our customers with better search capabilities and a faster checkout experience, and we updated our mobile app.
in fiscal 2016, we continued to invest in our interconnected capabilities to more effectively meet customers' demands for increased fulfillment options. we completed the deployment of our new com platform in all of our u.s. stores in fiscal 2016. we also completed the roll out of our bodfs program, which was built on the foundation of com and complements our existing interconnected retail programs. in fiscal 2016, approximately 45% of our online u.s. orders were picked up in our stores through our bopis and boss offerings. sales from our online channels increased 19.3% for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, and represented 5.9% of our total net sales for fiscal 2016. also in fiscal 2016, we enabled a dynamic eta feature for online orders, which provides our customers with a faster and more accurate delivery date based on their location. we believe this will continue to increase conversion rates and improve customer satisfaction. we will continue to blend our physical and digital assets in a seamless and frictionless way to enhance the end-to-end customer experience.
product authority - product authority is facilitated by our merchandising transformation and portfolio strategy, which is focused on delivering product innovation, assortment and value. in fiscal 2016, we continued to introduce a wide range of innovative new products to our do-it-yourself, do-it-for-me and professional customers, while remaining focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online. we also continued to leverage our merchandising assortment planning and pricing tools to better understand customer preferences and to refine our online and in-store product assortment in particular stores and geographic areas.
productivity and efficiency driven by capital allocation - our approach to driving productivity and efficiency is advanced through continuous operational improvement in our stores and supply chain, disciplined capital allocation, and building shareholder value through higher returns on invested capital and total value returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. in fiscal 2016, we continued to optimize our supply chain through our multi-year program called project sync. we rolled out the first phase of project sync to all of our u.s. stores, and we continue to onboard new suppliers. this program will allow us to significantly reduce our average lead time from supplier to shelf, reduce transportation expenses and improve inventory turns. as we continue to roll out project sync, we plan to create an end-to-end solution that benefits all participants in our supply chain, from our suppliers to our transportation providers, to our rdcs and store associates, and to our customers.
we repurchased a total of 53 million shares of our common stock for $7.0 billion through the open market during fiscal 2016. in addition, in february 2017, our board of directors authorized a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaces the previous authorization, and we announced a 29% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.89 per share.
in fiscal 2016, we opened four new stores in mexico, for a total store count of 2,278 at the end of fiscal 2016. as of the end of fiscal 2016, a total of 301 of our stores, or 13.2%, were located in canada and mexico.
in august 2015, we completed the acquisition of interline for $1.7 billion. this acquisition allowed us to establish a platform in the mro market where we serve primarily institutional customers, such as educational and healthcare institutions, hospitality businesses, and national apartment complexes.
we generated $9.8 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2016. this cash flow, along with $5.0 billion of long-term debt issued in fiscal 2016 and $360 million of short-term borrowings in fiscal 2016, was used to repay $3.0 billion of 5.40% senior notes that matured on march 1, 2016, fund cash payments of $6.9 billion for share repurchases, pay $3.4 billion of dividends and fund $1.6 billion in capital expenditures.
our inventory turnover ratio was 4.9 times at the end of both fiscal 2016 and 2015. our return on invested capital (defined as net operating profit after tax, a non-gaap financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by the average of beginning and ending long-term debt, including current installments, and equity for the most recent twelve-month period) was 31.4% at the end of fiscal 2016 compared to 28.1% at the end of fiscal 2015. for a reconciliation of net operating profit after tax to net earnings, the most comparable gaap financial measure, and our calculation of return on invested capital, see "non-gaap financial measures" below.
we believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the consolidated statements of earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented below are important in evaluating the performance of our business operations.

results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this report.
net sales net sales for fiscal 2016 increased 6.9% to $94.6 billion from $88.5 billion for fiscal 2015. the increase in net sales for fiscal 2016 primarily reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket growth, as well as sales from interline, which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. the increase in net sales was partially offset by pressure from the strengthening u.s. dollar, which negatively impacted total sales growth by $549 million in fiscal 2016.
total comparable store sales increased 5.6% for fiscal 2016, which reflects a number of factors, including the execution of our strategy, continued strength across our business, and an improved u.s. home improvement market. all of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2016. comparable store sales for our appliances, tools, lumber, lighting, décor, building materials and indoor garden product categories were above the company average for fiscal 2016. further, our comparable store customer transactions increased 2.8% for fiscal 2016 and comparable store average ticket increased 2.7% for fiscal 2016, due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases such as appliances, flooring and roofing, offset in part by the strength of the u.s. dollar.
gross profit gross profit increased 6.8% to $32.3 billion for fiscal 2016 from $30.3 billion for fiscal 2015. gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 34.2% for both fiscal 2016 and 2015. gross profit margin for fiscal 2016 reflects the impact of product mix changes, offset by benefits from our supply chain driven by increased productivity and benefits from reaching higher levels of co-op allowances and rebates in certain category classes.
operating expenses selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") increased 2.0% to $17.1 billion for fiscal 2016 from $16.8 billion for fiscal 2015. sg&a for fiscal 2016 included $37 million of pretax expenses related to the data breach compared to $128 million of pretax net expenses for fiscal 2015. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 18.1% for fiscal 2016 compared to 19.0% for fiscal 2015. the decrease in sg&a as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2016 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment and strong expense controls.
depreciation and amortization increased 3.8% to $1.8 billion for fiscal 2016 from $1.7 billion for fiscal 2015. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 1.9% for both fiscal 2016 and 2015. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2016 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment.
operating income operating income increased 14.0% to $13.4 billion for fiscal 2016 from $11.8 billion for fiscal 2015. operating income as a percent of net sales was 14.2% for fiscal 2016 compared to 13.3% for fiscal 2015.
interest and other, net in fiscal 2016, we recognized $936 million of interest and other, net, compared to $753 million for fiscal 2015. interest and other, net, for fiscal 2015 included a $144 million pretax gain related to the sale of our remaining equity ownership in hd supply. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 1.0% for fiscal 2016 compared to 0.9% for fiscal 2015 due primarily to the anniversary of the pretax gain related to the sale of our remaining equity ownership in hd supply in fiscal 2015 and higher long-term debt balances in fiscal 2016.
provision for income taxes our combined effective income tax rate was 36.3% for fiscal 2016 and 36.4% for fiscal 2015.
diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share were $6.45 for fiscal 2016 compared to $5.46 for fiscal 2015. expenses related to the data breach resulted in decreases of $0.02 and $0.06 to diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. the gain on the
sale of our remaining equity ownership in hd supply contributed a benefit of $0.07 to diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015.
net sales net sales for fiscal 2015 increased 6.4% to $88.5 billion from $83.2 billion for fiscal 2014. the increase in net sales for fiscal 2015 reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket growth, partially offset by pressure from the strengthening u.s. dollar. total comparable store sales increased 5.6% for fiscal 2015.
the positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2015 reflect a number of factors, including the execution of our key initiatives, an improved u.s. home improvement market and broad-based growth across our stores. all of our departments posted positive comparable store sales for fiscal 2015. comparable store sales for our tools, appliances, plumbing, décor, lighting, indoor garden, building materials and hardware product categories were above the company average for fiscal 2015. further, our comparable store customer transactions increased 4.0% for fiscal 2015 and comparable store average ticket increased 1.6% for fiscal 2015, due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases such as appliances, roofing and several installation service categories, offset in part by the strength of the u.s. dollar.
gross profit gross profit increased 6.6% to $30.3 billion for fiscal 2015 from $28.4 billion for fiscal 2014. gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 34.2% for fiscal 2015 compared to 34.1% for fiscal 2014, an increase of 6 basis points. the increase in gross profit margin for fiscal 2015 reflects benefits from our supply chain driven by lower fuel costs and increased productivity, partially offset by a change in the mix of products sold and the impact of interline, which has a lower gross profit margin.
operating expenses sg&a increased 3.2% to $16.8 billion for fiscal 2015 from $16.3 billion for fiscal 2014. sg&a for fiscal 2015 included $128 million of pretax net expenses related to the data breach compared to $33 million of pretax net expenses for fiscal 2014. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 19.0% for fiscal 2015 compared to 19.6% for fiscal 2014. the decrease in sg&a as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2015 reflects strong expense controls and expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment, partially offset by expenses related to the data breach.
depreciation and amortization increased 3.0% to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2015 from $1.6 billion for fiscal 2014. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 1.9% for fiscal 2015 compared to 2.0% for fiscal 2014. the decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2015 reflects expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable store sales environment.
operating income operating income increased 12.5% to $11.8 billion for fiscal 2015 from $10.5 billion for fiscal 2014. operating income as a percent of net sales was 13.3% for fiscal 2015 compared to 12.6% for fiscal 2014.
interest and other, net in fiscal 2015, we recognized $753 million of interest and other, net, compared to $493 million for fiscal 2014. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 0.9% for fiscal 2015 compared to 0.6% for fiscal 2014. these results include a $144 million pretax gain in fiscal 2015 related to the sale of our remaining equity ownership in hd supply compared to a pretax gain of $323 million in fiscal 2014 related to the sales of portions of our equity ownership in hd supply. interest and other, net, for fiscal 2015 also reflects additional interest expense associated with $4.0 billion of long-term debt issued in fiscal 2015.
provision for income taxes our combined effective income tax rate was 36.4% for both fiscal 2015 and 2014.
diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share were $5.46 for fiscal 2015 compared to $4.71 for fiscal 2014. expenses related to the data breach had a negative impact of $0.06 to diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 compared to a negative impact of $0.02 for fiscal 2014. the gains on the sales of our equity ownership in hd supply contributed a benefit of $0.07 to diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 compared to a benefit of $0.15 for fiscal 2014.
non-gaap financial measures to provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-gaap financial measures. however, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures. non-gaap financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies.
return on invested capital we believe return on invested capital ("roic") is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. we define roic as net operating profit after tax ("nopat"), a non-gaap financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by the average of beginning and ending long-term debt, including current installments, and equity for the most recent twelve-month period.
the following table provides our roic calculation and reconciles nopat to net earnings, the most comparable gaap financial measure, for the twelve months ended january 29, 2017 and january 31, 2016 (amounts in millions):
for the twelve months ended january 29,             january 31,

(2)   average debt and equity is defined as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt, including current installments, and equity for the most recent twelve-month period.
liquidity and capital resources cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. for fiscal 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $9.8 billion compared to $9.4 billion for fiscal 2015. this increase was primarily due to a $948 million increase in net earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense leverage partially offset by a $442 million decrease in cash flows from accounts payable and accrued expenses related to the timing of purchases and payments, and a $223 million increase in merchandise inventories as a result of increased inventory purchases in support of increased sales.
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2016 was $1.6 billion compared to $3.0 billion for fiscal 2015. this change was primarily due to $1.7 billion in payments for businesses acquired, net, in fiscal 2015 related to the acquisition of interline.
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2016 was $7.9 billion compared to $5.8 billion for fiscal 2015. this change was primarily due to $2.0 billion less in net incremental long-term debt issued in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.
in fiscal 2016, we repurchased 53 million shares of our common stock for $7.0 billion through the open market. since the inception of our initial share repurchase program in 2002 and through fiscal 2016, we have repurchased 1.3 billion shares of our common stock for a total of $67.1 billion. in february 2017, our board of directors authorized a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaces the previous authorization.
in september 2016, we issued $1.0 billion of 2.125% senior notes due september 15, 2026 (the "september 2026 notes") at a discount of $11 million and $1.0 billion of 3.50% senior notes due september 15, 2056 (the "2056 notes") at a discount of $19 million (together, the "september 2016 issuance"). interest on the september 2026 notes and the 2056 notes is due semi-annually on march 15 and september 15 of each year, beginning march 15, 2017. the net proceeds of the september 2016 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock.
in february 2016, we issued $1.35 billion of 2.00% senior notes due april 1, 2021 (the "2021 notes") at a discount of $5 million, $1.3 billion of 3.00% senior notes due april 1, 2026 (the "april 2026 notes") at a discount of $8 million, and $350 million of 4.25% senior notes due april 1, 2046 (the "2046 notes") at a premium of $2 million (together, the "february 2016 issuance"). the 2046 notes form a single series with our $1.25 billion of 4.25% senior notes due april 1, 2046 that were issued in may 2015, and have the same terms. the aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes due april 1, 2046 is $1.6 billion. interest on the 2021 notes and the april 2026 notes is due semi-annually on april 1 and october 1 of each year, beginning october 1, 2016. interest on the 2046 notes is due semi-annually on april 1 and october 1 of each year, beginning april 1, 2016, with interest accruing from october 1, 2015. the net proceeds of the february 2016 issuance were used to repay our 5.40% senior notes that matured on march 1, 2016 (the "2016 notes"). as a result, the 2016 notes were classified as long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of january 31, 2016.
in fiscal 2015, we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of $1.0 billion, accounted for as cash flow hedges, to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the february 2016 issuance. in connection with the february 2016 issuance, we paid $89 million to settle these forward starting interest rate swap agreements. this amount, net of income taxes, is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the april 2026 notes.
in september 2015, we issued $500 million of floating rate senior notes due september 15, 2017 (the "2017 notes") and $1.0 billion of 3.35% senior notes due september 15, 2025 (the "2025 notes") at a discount of $1 million (together, the "september 2015 issuance"). the 2017 notes bear interest at a variable rate determined quarterly equal to the three-month libor rate plus 37 basis points. interest on the 2017 notes is due quarterly on march 15, june 15, september 15 and december 15 of each year, beginning december 15, 2015. interest on the 2025 notes is due semi-annually on march 15 and september 15 of each year, beginning march 15, 2016. the net proceeds of the september 2015 issuance were used to fund the acquisition of interline.
in may 2015, we issued $1.25 billion of 2.625% senior notes due june 1, 2022 (the "2022 notes") at a discount of $5 million and $1.25 billion of 4.25% senior notes due april 1, 2046 (the "existing 2046 notes") at a discount of $3 million (together, the "may 2015 issuance"). interest on the 2022 notes is due semi-annually on june 1 and december 1 of each year, beginning december 1, 2015. interest on the existing 2046 notes is due semi-annually on april 1 and october 1 of each year, beginning october 1, 2015. the net proceeds of the may 2015 issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock.
in november 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on september 10, 2018, with a notional amount of $500 million, accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on our 2.25% senior notes due september 10, 2018 for variable interest equal to libor plus 88 basis points. at january 29, 2017, the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $3 million, which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
also in november 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on september 15, 2020, with a notional amount of $500 million, accounted for as a fair value hedge, that swaps fixed rate interest on our 3.95% senior notes due september 15, 2020 for variable interest equal to libor plus 183 basis points. at january 29, 2017, the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of $10 million, which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. all of our short-term borrowings in fiscal 2016 and 2015 were under these commercial paper programs. in connection with these programs, we have a back-up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. the credit facility expires in december 2019 and contains various restrictive covenants. at january 29, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. at january 29, 2017 and january 31, 2016, there were $710 million and $350 million, respectively, of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs. see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our commercial paper programs and related credit facility.
we use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers and store support centers. the net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in long-term debt and current installments of long-term debt. in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, the operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.
as of january 29, 2017, we had $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. we believe that our current cash position, access to the long-term debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. in addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing.
off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.

(1)   excludes present value of capital lease obligations, fair value of interest rate swaps, unamortized debt discounts, premiums and debt issuance costs.
(4)   purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, utility purchases, capital expenditures, software acquisitions and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above.
(5)   excludes $484 million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments.
(6)   excludes estimated loss contingencies related to the data breach due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates. interest rate swap agreements are used, at times, to manage our fixed/floating rate debt portfolio. at january 29, 2017, after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements, approximately 93% of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixed-rate debt and 7% was floating-rate debt. a 1.0 percentage point change in the interest costs of floating-rate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
as of january 29, 2017 we had, net of discounts, $22.0 billion of senior notes outstanding. the aggregate market value of these publicly traded senior notes as of january 29, 2017 was $23.6 billion.
we are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into u.s. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies. revenues from these foreign operations accounted for approximately $8.0 billion and $8.0 billion of our revenue for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition or results of operations.
impact of inflation, deflation and changing prices we have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. we do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations. although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates.
revenues we recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. we estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns. we have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns. however, if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts, our sales could be adversely impacted. when we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is complete. we also record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in net sales.
merchandise inventories our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, with approximately 70% valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method. retailers like us, with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions, frequently use the retail inventory method. under the retail inventory method, merchandise inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories. as our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory valued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. we evaluate our inventory valued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. the valuation allowance for merchandise inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our consolidated financial statements as of the end of fiscal 2016 or 2015.
independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for merchandise inventories are properly stated. during the period between physical inventory counts in our stores, we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store-by-store basis. shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, "swell") is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. we estimate shrink as a percent of net sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories. the estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent
shrink results and current trends in the business. actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.
self-insurance we have established liabilities for certain losses related to general liability (including product liability), workers' compensation, employee group medical and automobile claims for which we are self-insured. our self-insured retention or deductible, as applicable, for each claim involving general liability, workers' compensation and automobile liability is limited to $25 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively. we do not have any stop loss limits for self-insured employee group medical claims. our liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. the estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. the liabilities are reviewed by management and third-party actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate. while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014. we maintain network security and privacy liability insurance coverage to limit our exposure to losses such as those that may be caused by a significant compromise or breach of our data security. this coverage is discussed further in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
vendor allowances vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co-op allowances for the promotion of vendors' products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. these vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. we believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors.
volume rebates and certain advertising co-op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in merchandise inventories and a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold. certain advertising co-op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors' products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in sg&a.
impairment of long-lived assets we evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, management's decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. the evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.
the assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value. the estimate of cash flows includes management's assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including gross margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value. impairment losses are recorded as a component of sg&a in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. when a leased location closes, we also recognize in sg&a the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income.
we make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of long-lived assets. our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition and inflation. a 10% decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations. our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations. a 10% decrease in estimated sublease income and a 10% increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on our results of operations. we recorded impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business, which were not material to the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. we do not amortize goodwill but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. each year we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments, with a quantitative assessment completed at least once every three years. we completed a quantitative assessment in fiscal 2016.
in fiscal 2016, we completed our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill for our u.s., canada and mexico reporting units. the fair values of these reporting units were estimated using the present value of expected future discounted cash flows, and the fair value exceeded the carrying value for each respective reporting unit. there were no impairment charges related to goodwill for fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.
we amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range up to 12 years, unless such lives are deemed indefinite. intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. there were no impairment charges related to our other intangible assets for fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.

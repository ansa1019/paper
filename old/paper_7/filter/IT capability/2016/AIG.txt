table of contents item 7 | use of non-gaap measures use of non-gaap measures in item 1. business, item 6. selected financial data and throughout this md&a, we present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful and representative of our business results. some of the measurements we use are "non‐gaap financial measures" under sec rules and regulations. gaap is the acronym for "accounting principles generally accepted in the united states." the non‐gaap financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly‐named measures reported by other companies.
book value per common share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci), book value per common share excluding aoci and deferred tax assets (dta) (adjusted book value per common share) and adjusted book value per common share including dividend growth are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis. we believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and u.s. tax attribute deferred tax assets. these measures also eliminate the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. we exclude deferred tax assets representing u.s. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the dta utilized is included in these book value per common share metrics. book value per common share excluding aoci, is derived by dividing total aig shareholders' equity, excluding aoci, by total common shares outstanding. adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total aig shareholders' equity, excluding aoci and dta (adjusted shareholders' equity), by total common shares outstanding. adjusted book value per common share including dividend growth is derived by dividing adjusted shareholders' equity, including growth in quarterly dividends above $0.125 per share to shareholders, by total common shares outstanding.  the reconciliation to book value per common share, the most comparable gaap measure, is presented in item 6. selected financial data.
return on equity - after-tax operating income excluding aoci and dta (adjusted return on equity) is used to show the rate of return on shareholders' equity. we believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and u.s. tax attribute deferred tax assets. this measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. we exclude deferred tax assets representing u.s. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the dta utilized is included in adjusted return on equity. adjusted return on equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized after-tax operating income attributable to aig by average adjusted shareholders' equity. the reconciliation to return on equity, the most comparable gaap measure, is presented in item 6. selected financial data.
after-tax operating income attributable to aig is derived by excluding the tax effected pre-tax operating income (ptoi) adjustments described below and the following tax items from net income attributable to aig.
·       uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance.
general operating expenses, operating basis is derived by making the following adjustments to general operating and other expenses: include (i) certain loss adjustment expenses, reported as policyholder benefits and losses incurred and (ii) certain investment and other expenses reported as net investment income, and exclude (i) advisory fee expenses, (ii) non-deferrable insurance commissions, (iii) direct marketing and acquisition expenses, net of deferrals, (iv) non-operating litigation reserves and (v) other expense related to an asbestos retroactive reinsurance agreement. we use general operating expenses, operating basis, because we believe it provides a more meaningful indication of our ordinary course of business operating costs, regardless of within which financial statement line item these expenses are reported externally within our segment results. the majority of these expenses are employee-related costs.  for example, other acquisition and loss adjustment expenses primarily represent employee-related costs in the underwriting and claims functions, respectively.  excluded from this measure are non-operating expenses (such as restructuring costs and litigation reserves), direct marketing expenses, insurance company assessments and non-deferrable commissions.

operating revenues exclude net realized capital gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in other income for gaap purposes) and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in net investment income for gaap purposes). operating revenues are a gaap measure for our operating segments.
pre-tax operating income is derived by excluding the following items from income from continuing operations before income tax. this definition is consistent across our modules (including geography). these items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and measures that we believe to be common to the industry. ptoi is a gaap measure for our operating segments.

·       commercial insurance: liability and financial lines, property and special risks; consumer insurance: personal insurance
-   ratios: we, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. these ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for commercial insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under gaap, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. the underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. in addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.
-   accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted: both the accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact in excess of $10 million each. catastrophes also include certain man-made events, such as terrorism and civil disorders that meet the $10 million threshold. we believe the as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an on-going basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of management's control. we also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results.
·       consumer insurance: individual retirement, group retirement, and life insurance; other operations: institutional markets
-   premiums and deposits: includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and life‐contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment‐type annuity contracts and mutual funds.
table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment.
the accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, which are critical accounting estimates, are related to the determination of:
valuation of future policy benefit liabilities and timing and extent of loss recognition;
valuation of liabilities for guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity products;
estimated gross profits to value deferred acquisition costs for investment-oriented products;
impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments on available for sale securities, impairments on other invested assets, including investments in life settlements, and goodwill impairment;
liability for legal contingencies;
fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities; and
income tax assets and liabilities, including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax assets.
these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. to the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected.
insurance liabilities loss reserves the estimate of the loss reserves relies on several key judgments:
·       the determination of the appropriate groupings of similar product lines and, in some cases, the groupings of dissimilar losses within a product line.
all of our methods to calculate net reserves include assumptions about estimated reinsurance recoveries and their collectability. reinsurance collectability is evaluated independently of the reserving process and appropriate allowances for uncollectible reinsurance are established.
table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates overview of loss reserving process and methods our loss reserves can generally be categorized into two distinct groups. short-tail reserves consists principally of u.s. and europe property and special risks, and u.s., europe and japan personal insurance. long-tail reserves include u.s. workers' compensation, u.s. excess casualty, u.s. other casualty, u.s. financial lines, europe casualty and financial lines, and u.s. run-off long tail insurance lines.
short-tail reserves for our short-tail coverages, such as property, where the nature of claims is generally high frequency but with short reporting periods, with volatility arising from occasional severe events, the process for recording non-catastrophe quarterly loss reserves is geared toward maintaining ibnr based on percentages of net earned premiums for that business, rather than projecting ultimate loss ratios based on reported losses. for example, the ibnr reserve required for the latest accident quarter for a product line of property business such as personal lines automobile might be approximately 20 percent of the quarter's earned premiums. this level of reserve would generally be recorded regardless of the actual losses reported in the current quarter, thus allowing the recognition of severe events as they occur. the percent of premium factor reflects both our expectation of the ultimate loss costs associated with the line of business and the expectation of the percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported.  the expected ultimate loss costs generally reflect the average loss costs from a period of preceding accident quarters that have been adjusted for changes in rate and loss cost levels, mix of business, known exposure to unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular line of business. the expected percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported would be derived from historical loss emergence patterns. for more mature quarters, loss development methods would be used to determine the ibnr. for other product lines where the nature of claims is high frequency but low severity, methods including loss development, frequency/severity or a multiple of average monthly losses may be used to determine ibnr reserves. ibnr for claims arising from catastrophic events or events of unusual severity would be determined in close collaboration with the claims department's knowledge of known information, using alternative techniques or expected percentages of ultimate loss cost emergence based on historical loss emergence of similar claim types.
long-tail reserves estimation of ultimate net losses and loss adjustment expenses (net losses) for our long-tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the product line and volume of business, as well as estimates of the reinsurance recoverable. experience in the more recent accident years generally provides limited statistical credibility of reported net losses on long-tail casualty lines of business. that is because in the more recent accident years, a relatively low proportion of estimated ultimate net incurred losses are reported or paid. therefore, ibnr reserves constitute a relatively high proportion of net losses.
for our longer-tail lines, we generally make actuarial and other assumptions with respect to the following:
2016 loss reserve analysis) and, in some cases for accident years prior to the latest accident year. the expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years, adjusted for the loss cost trend and the effect of rate changes and other quantifiable factors on the loss ratio. for low-frequency, high-severity lines of business such as excess casualty, expected loss ratios generally are used for at least the three most recent accident years.
tail factors are development factors used for certain longer tailed lines of business (for example, excess casualty, workers' compensation and general liability),to project future loss development for periods that extend beyond the available development data. the development of losses to the ultimate loss for a given accident year for these lines may take decades and the projection of ultimate losses for an accident year is very sensitive to the tail factors selected beyond a certain age.
table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates we record quarterly changes in loss reserves for each product line of business. the overall change in our loss reserves is based on the sum of the changes for all product lines of business. for most long-tail product lines of business, the quarterly loss reserve changes are based on the estimated current loss ratio for each subset of coverage less any amounts paid. also, any change in estimated ultimate losses from prior accident years deemed to be necessary based on the results of our latest detailed valuation reviews, large loss analyses, or other analytical techniques, either positive or negative, is reflected in the loss reserve for the current quarter. differences between actual loss emergence in a given period and our expectations based on prior loss reserve estimates are used to monitor reserve adequacy between detailed valuation reviews and may also influence our judgment with respect to adjusting reserve estimates.
details of the loss reserving process the process of determining the current loss ratio for each product line of business is based on a variety of factors. these include considerations such as: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; rate changes; and changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business. other considerations include actual and anticipated changes in external factors such as trends in loss costs, real gross domestic product (gdp) growth, inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration, stock market volatility, corporate bond spreads, or in the legal and claims environment. the current loss ratio for each product line of business is intended to represent our best estimate after reflecting all of the relevant factors. at the close of each quarter, the assumptions and data underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine whether the loss ratios remain appropriate. this process includes a review of the actual loss experience in the quarter, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in reinsurance, quantifiable changes in coverage or mix of business, and changes in other factors that may affect the loss ratio. when this review suggests that the previously determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the loss ratio is changed to reflect the revised estimates.
we conduct a comprehensive loss detailed valuation review at least annually for each product line of business in accordance with actuarial standards of practice. these standards provide that the unpaid loss estimate may be presented in a variety of ways, such as a point estimate, a range of estimates, a point estimate based on the expected value of several reasonable estimates, or a probability distribution of the unpaid loss amount. our actuarial central estimate for each product line of business represents an expected value generally considering a range of reasonably possible outcomes.
the reserve analysis for each product line of business is performed by a credentialed actuarial team in collaboration with claims, underwriting, business unit management, risk management and senior management. our actuaries consider the ongoing applicability of prior data groupings and update numerous assumptions, including the analysis and selection of loss development and loss trend factors. they also determine and select the most appropriate actuarial or other methods used to estimate reserve adequacy for each business product line, and may employ multiple methods and assumptions for each product line. these data groupings, accident year weights, method selections and assumptions necessarily change over time as business mix changes, development factors mature and become more credible and loss characteristics evolve. in the course of these detailed valuation reviews an actuarial best estimate of the loss reserve is determined. the sum of these estimates for each product line of business yields an overall actuarial best estimate for that line of business.
we develop explicit ranges of reasonable estimates around the actuarial best estimate for certain product lines using multiple methodologies and varying assumptions. where we have ranges, we use them to inform our selection of best estimates of loss reserves by major product line of business. our range of reasonable estimates is not intended to cover all possibilities or extreme values and is based on known data and facts at the time of estimation.
we consult with third party environmental litigation and engineering specialists, third party toxic tort claims professionals, third party clinical and public health specialists, third party workers' compensation claims adjusters and third party actuarial advisors to help inform our judgments, as needed.
a critical component of our detailed valuation reviews is a peer review of our reserving analyses and conclusions, where actuaries independent of the initial review evaluate the reasonableness of assumptions used, methods selected and weightings given to different methods.  in addition, each detailed valuation review is subjected to a review and challenge process by specialists in our enterprise risk management group.
table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates we consider key factors in performing detailed actuarial reviews, including:
an assessment of economic conditions including real gdp growth, inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration, stock market volatility and changes in corporate bond spreads;
(inflation, intensity and utilization of medical services) and wage inflation trends
underlying policy pricing, terms and conditions including attachment points and policy limits;
input from underwriters on pricing, terms, and conditions and market trends; and
actuarial and other methods for major lines of business our actuaries determine the most appropriate actuarial methods and segmentation. this determination is based on a variety of factors including the nature of the losses associated with the product line of business, such as the frequency or severity of the claims. in addition to determining the actuarial methods, the actuaries determine the appropriate loss reserve groupings of data. this determination is a judgmental, dynamic process and refinements to the groupings are made every year. the changes to groupings may be driven by and may change to reflect observed or emerging patterns within and across product lines, or to differentiate different risk characteristics (for example, size of deductibles and extent of third party claims specialists used by our insureds). as an example of reserve segmentation, we write many unique subsets of professional liability. for pricing or other purposes, it is appropriate to evaluate the profitability of each subset individually. however, for purposes of estimating the liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses for many product lines of business, we believe it is appropriate to combine the subsets into larger groups to produce a greater degree of credibility in the loss experience. this determination of data segmentation and related actuarial methods is assessed, reviewed and updated at least annually.
the actuarial methods we use most commonly include paid and incurred loss development methods, expected loss ratio methods, including "bornhuetter ferguson" and "cape cod", and frequency/severity models. loss development methods utilize the actual loss development patterns from prior accident years updated through the current year to project the reported losses to an ultimate basis for all accident years. we also use this information to update our current accident year loss selections. loss development methods are generally most appropriate for classes of business that exhibit a stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next, and for which the components of the product line have similar development characteristics. for example, property exposures would generally not be combined into the same product line as casualty exposures, and primary casualty exposures would generally not be combined into the same product line as excess casualty exposures. we continually refine our loss reserving techniques for the domestic primary casualty product line of business and adopt further segmentations based on our analysis of differing emerging loss patterns for certain product lines. we generally use expected loss ratio methods in cases where the reported loss data lacked sufficient credibility to utilize loss development methods, such as for new product lines of business or for long-tail product lines at early stages of loss development.  frequency/severity models may be used where sufficient frequency counts are available to apply such approaches.
table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates loss experience to date. in the example above, loss development methods would typically indicate an ultimate loss estimate of $10 million, as the reported losses of $1 million would be estimated to reflect only 10 percent of the ultimate losses.
a key advantage of loss development methods is that they respond more quickly to any actual changes in loss costs for the product line of business. therefore, if loss experience is unexpectedly deteriorating or improving, the loss development method gives full credibility to the changing experience. expected loss ratio methods would be slower to respond to the change, as they would continue to give more weight to a prior expected loss ratio, until enough evidence emerged to modify the expected loss ratio to reflect the changing loss experience. on the other hand, loss development methods have the disadvantage of overreacting to changes in reported losses if the loss experience is anomalous due to the various key factors described above and the inherent volatility in some of the classes. for example, the presence or absence of large losses at the early stages of loss development could cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable or unfavorable experience by assuming it is a fundamental shift in the development pattern. in these instances, expected loss ratio methods such as bornhuetter ferguson have the advantage of recognizing large losses without extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported portion of the losses for the accident year.
frequency/severity methods generally rely on the determination of an ultimate number of claims and an average severity for each claim for each accident year. multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claims for each accident year by the expected average severity of each claim produces the estimated ultimate loss for the accident year. frequency/severity methods generally require a sufficient volume of claims in order for the average severity to be predictable. average severity for subsequent accident years is generally determined by applying an estimated annual loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from prior accident years. in certain cases, a structural approach may also be used to predict the ultimate loss cost. frequency/severity methods have the advantage that ultimate claim counts can generally be estimated more quickly and accurately than can ultimate losses. thus, if the average claim severity can be accurately estimated, these methods can more quickly respond to changes in loss experience than other methods. however, for average severity to be predictable, the product line of business must consist of homogenous types of claims for which loss severity trends from one year to the next are reasonably consistent and where there are limited changes to deductible levels or limits. generally these methods work best for high frequency, low severity product lines of business such as personal auto. however, frequency and severity metrics are also used to test the reasonability of results for other product lines of business and provide indications of underlying trends in the data. in addition, ultimate claim counts can be used as an alternative exposure measure to earned premiums in the cape cod method.
structural driver analytics seek to explain the underlying drivers of frequency/severity.  a structural driver analysis of frequency/severity is particularly useful for understanding the key drivers of uncertainty in the ultimate loss cost. for example, for the excess workers' compensation product line of business, we have attempted to corroborate our judgment by considering the impact on severity of the future potential for deterioration of an injured worker's medical condition, the impact of price inflation on the various categories of medical expense and cost of living adjustments on indemnity benefits, the impact of injured worker mortality and claim specific settlement and loss mitigation strategies, etc., using the following:
•     claim by claim reviews, often facilitated by third party specialists, to determine the stability and likelihood of settling an injured worker's indemnity and medical benefits;
•     analysis of the potential for future deterioration in medical condition unlikely to be picked up by a claim file review and associated with potentially costly medical procedures (i.e., increases in both utilization and intensity of medical care) over the course of the injured worker's lifetime;
•     analysis of the cost of medical price inflation for each category of medical spend (services and devices) and for cost of living adjustments in line with statutory requirements;
•     portfolio specific mortality level and mortality improvement assumptions based on a mortality study conducted for our primary and excess workers' compensation portfolios and our opinion of future longevity trends for the open reported cases;
•     ground-up consideration of the reinsurance recoveries expected for the product line of business for reported claims with extrapolation for unreported claims; and
•     the effects of various run-off loss management strategies that have been developed by our run-off unit.
table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates in recent years, we have expanded our analysis of structural drivers to additional product lines of business as a means of corroborating our judgments using traditional actuarial techniques. for example, we have explicitly used external estimates of future medical inflation and mortality in estimating the loss development tail for excess of deductible primary workers' compensation business. using external forecasts for items such as these can improve the accuracy and stability of our estimates.
the estimation of liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental pollution losses on insurance policies written many years ago is typically subject to greater uncertainty than other types of losses. this is due to inconsistent court decisions, as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies or have expanded theories of liability. in addition, reinsurance recoverable balances relating to asbestos and environmental loss reserves are subject to greater uncertainty due to the underlying age of the claim, underlying legal issues surrounding the nature of the coverage, and determination of proper policy period. for these reasons, these balances tend to be subject to increased levels of disputes and legal collection activity when actually billed. the insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures.
we continue to receive claims asserting injuries and damages from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. the vast majority of these asbestos and environmental losses emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. commencing in 1985, standard policies contained absolute exclusions for pollution-related damage and asbestos. the current environmental policies that we specifically price and underwrite for environmental risks on a claims-made basis have been excluded from the analysis.
the majority of our exposures for asbestos and environmental losses are related to excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity amounts, with litigation expenses included within the limits of the liability we incur. individual significant loss reserves, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case-by-case basis.
the loss cost trend assumption is not believed to be material with respect to our loss reserves. this is primarily because our actuaries are generally able to use loss development projections for all but the most recent accident year's reserves, so there is limited need to rely on loss cost trend assumptions for primary workers'
the tail factor is typically the most critical assumption, and small changes in the selected tail factor can have a material effect on our carried reserves. for example, the tail factors beyond twenty years for guaranteed cost business could vary by one percent above or below those actually indicated in the 2016 loss reserve review. for excess of deductible business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that tail factors beyond twenty years could vary by five percent above or below those actually indicated in the 2016 loss reserve review.

u.s. excess                    we utilize various casualty                       loss cost trend assumptions for different segments of the portfolio. after evaluating the historical loss cost trends from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year-end 2016 loss reserve review for u.s.
excess casualty may range five percent lower or higher than this estimated loss trend. the loss cost trend assumption is critical for the u.s. excess casualty class of business due to the long-tail nature of the losses, and is applied across many accident years. thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years (the expected loss ratio years) to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends that were initially relied upon in setting the loss reserves. these changes in loss trends could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.
u.s. excess casualty is a long-tail class of business and any deviation in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. mass tort claims in particular may develop over a very extended period and impact multiple accident years, so we usually select a separate pattern for them. thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves.
after evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the actual loss development factors could vary by an amount equivalent to a six month shift from those actually utilized in the year-end 2016 reserve review. this would impact projections both for accident years where the selections were directly based on loss development methods as well as the a priori loss ratio assumptions for accident years with selections based on bornhuetter-ferguson or cape cod methods. similar to loss cost trends, these changes in loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.
u.s. other                     the key casualty                       uncertainties for other casualty lines are similar to excess casualty, as the underlying business is long-tailed and can be subject to variability in loss cost trends and changes in loss development factors. these may differ significantly by line of business as coverages such as general liability, medical malpractice and environmental may be subject to different risk drivers.
u.s. financial                 the loss cost lines                          trends for u.s. d&amp;o business vary by year and subset, but for the most recent accident years, it is assumed to have been generally close to zero.
after evaluating the historical loss cost levels from prior accident years since the early 1990s, including the potential effect of losses relating to the credit crisis, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the actual variation in loss cost levels for these subsets could vary by approximately
15 percent lower or higher on a year-over-year basis than the assumptions actually utilized in the year-end 2016 reserve review. because u.s. d&amp;o business has exhibited highly volatile loss trends from one accident year to the next, there is the possibility of an exceptionally high deviation. in our analysis, the effects of loss cost trend assumptions affect the results through the a priori loss ratio assumptions used for the bornhuetter-ferguson and cape cod methods, which impact the projections for the two most recent two accident years.
the assumed loss development factors are also an important assumption, but are less critical than for u.s. excess casualty. because these classes are written on a claims made basis, the loss reporting and development tail is much shorter than for u.s. excess casualty. however, the high severity nature of the losses does create the potential for significant deviations in loss development patterns from one year to the next. similar to excess casualty, after evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early
1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factors could change by an amount equivalent to a shift by six months from those actually utilized in the year-end 2016 reserve review.
u.s. and europe                for short-tail property and special risks     lines such as property and special risks, variance in outcomes for individual large claims or events can have a significant impact on results. these outcomes generally relate to unique characteristics of events such as catastrophes or losses with significant business interruption claims.
variance in estimates can result from unique events such as catastrophes. in addition, some subsets of this business, such as auto liability, can be impacted by changes in loss development factors and loss cost trends.
table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates line of                                                  key business or category                                       assumptions
u.s. run-off                we historically long tail insurance lines   have used a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for excess workers' compensation and other run-off segments. for environmental claims, we have utilized a variety of methods including traditional loss development approaches, claim department and other expert evaluations of the ultimate costs for certain claims and survival ratio metrics.
u.s. run-off long tail insurance lines is an extremely long-tail class of business, with a much greater than normal uncertainty as to the appropriate loss development factors for the tail of the loss development. specifically for excess workers' compensation, after evaluating the historical loss development factors for prior accident years since the 1980s as well as the development over the past several years of the ground up loss projections utilized to help select the loss development factors in the tail for this class of business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the tail factor beyond 30 years could vary by 10 percent above or below that actually indicated in the 2016 loss reserve review.
other reserve               loss adjustment items                       expenses (lae) are separated into two broad categories, allocated loss adjustment expenses (alae), also referred to as legal defense and cost containment or "legal" and unallocated loss adjustment expenses (ulae), which includes certain claims adjuster fees and other internal claim management costs.
we determine loss adjustment expenses reserves for legal expenses for each class of business by one or more actuarial or structural driver methods. for the majority of segments, legal costs are analyzed in conjunction with losses. for segments where they are separately analyzed the methods used generally include development methods comparable to those described for loss development methods. the development could be based on either the paid loss adjustment expenses or the ratio of paid loss adjustment expenses to paid losses, or both. other methods include the utilization of expected ultimate ratios of paid loss expense to paid losses, based on actual experience from prior accident years or from similar product lines of business.
the bulk of adjuster expenses are allocated and charged to individual claim files. for these expenses, we generally determine reserves based on calendar year ratios of adjuster expenses paid to losses paid for the particular product line of business. for other internal claim costs, which generally relate to specific claim department expenses that are not specifically allocated to claim files such as technology costs and other broad initiatives, we look at historic and expected expenditures for these items and project these into the future.
the incidence of lae are directly related to the frequency, complexity and level of underlying claims. as a result, key drivers of variability in lae is the variability in the overall claims, particularly for long tail lines.
the following sensitivity analysis table summarizes the effect on the loss reserve position of using certain alternative loss cost trend (for accident years where we use expected loss ratio methods) or loss development factor assumptions rather than the assumptions actually used in determining our estimates in the year-end loss reserve analyses in 2016.
table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts long-duration traditional products include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long-term care insurance, and certain payout annuities for which the payment period is life-contingent, which include certain of our single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements.
for long-duration traditional business, a "lock-in" principle applies.  the assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and dac are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. the assumptions include mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns. these assumptions are typically consistent with pricing inputs. the assumptions also include margins for adverse deviation, principally for key assumptions such as mortality and interest rates used to discount cash flows, to reflect uncertainty given that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions. establishing margins at contract inception requires management judgment.  the extent of the margin for adverse deviation may vary depending on the uncertainty of the cash flows, which is affected by the volatility of the business and the extent of our experience with the product.
loss recognition occurs if observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing. to determine whether loss recognition exists, we determine whether a future loss is expected based on updated current assumptions.  if loss recognition exists, we recognize the loss by first reducing dac through amortization expense, and, if dac is depleted, record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit expense. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on loss recognition.  because of the long-term nature of many of our liabilities subject to the "lock-in" principle, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy. in particular, changes in estimates of future invested asset returns have a large effect on the degree of reserve deficiency.
groupings for loss recognition testing are consistent with our manner of acquiring, servicing, and measuring the profitability of the business and are applied by product groupings.  we perform separate loss recognition tests for traditional life products, payout annuities, and long-term care insurance. once loss recognition has been recorded for a block of business, the old assumption set is replaced and the assumption set used for the loss recognition would then be subject to the lock-in principle.  key judgments made in loss recognition testing include the following:
•     to determine investment returns used in loss recognition tests, we typically segregate assets that match the duration of our liabilities with assets of comparable duration, to the extent practicable, and then project future cash flows on those assets. assets supporting insurance liabilities are primarily comprised of a diversified portfolio of high quality fixed maturity securities, and may also include, to a lesser extent, alternative investments. our projections include a reasonable allowance for investment expenses and expected credit losses over the projection horizon. a critical assumption in the projection of expected investment income is the assumed net rate of investment return at which excess cash flows are to be reinvested.  for products in which asset and liability durations are matched relatively well, this is less of a consideration since interest on excess cash flows are not a significant component of future cash flows.  for the reinvestment rate assumption, anticipated future changes to the yield curves could have a large effect.  given the interest rate environment applicable at the date of our most recent loss recognition tests, we assumed a modest and gradual increase in long-term interest rates over time.
table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates
•     for mortality assumptions, key judgments include the extent of industry versus own experience to base future assumptions as well as the extent of expected mortality improvements in the future.  the latter judgment is based on a combination of historical mortality trends and advice from industry, public health and demography specialists that were consulted by aig's actuaries and published industry information.
•     for surrender rates, a key judgment involves the correlation between expected increases/decreases in interest rates and increases/decreases in surrender rates. to support this judgment, we compare crediting rates on our products relative to expected rates on competing products under different interest rate scenarios.
significant unrealized appreciation on investments in a prolonged low interest rate environment may cause dac to be adjusted and additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded through a charge directly to accumulated other comprehensive income ("shadow loss recognition"). these charges are included, net of tax, with the change in net unrealized appreciation of investments.  see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on shadow loss recognition. in applying shadow loss recognition, the company overlays unrealized gains onto loss recognition tests without revising the underlying test.  accordingly, there is limited additional judgment in this process.
guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity products variable annuity products offered by our individual retirement and group retirement product lines offer guaranteed benefit features. these guaranteed features include guaranteed minimum death benefits (gmdb) that are payable in the event of death or other instances, and living benefits that are payable in the event of annuitization, or, in other instances, at specified dates during the accumulation period. living benefits include guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (gmwb) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (gmib). see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these features.
the liabilities for gmdb and gmib, which are recorded in future policyholder benefits, represent the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account value, with the excess recognized ratably through policyholder benefits and losses incurred over the accumulation period based on total expected fee assessments. the liabilities for gmwb, which are recorded in policyholder contract deposits, are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value of the liabilities recorded in other realized capital gains (losses).
our exposure to the guaranteed amounts is equal to the amount by which the contract holder's account balance is below the amount provided by the guaranteed feature. a variable annuity contract may include more than one type of guaranteed benefit feature; for example, it may have both a gmdb and a gmwb. however, a policyholder can generally only receive payout from one guaranteed feature on a contract containing a death benefit and a living benefit, i.e. the features are generally mutually exclusive, so the exposure to the guaranteed amount for each feature is independent of the exposure from other features (except a surviving spouse who has a rider to potentially collect both a gmdb upon their spouse's death and a gmwb during his or her lifetime).  a policyholder cannot purchase more than one living benefit on one contract. declines in the equity markets, increased volatility and a sustained low interest rate environment increase our exposure to potential benefits under the guaranteed features, leading to an increase in the liabilities for those benefits. see estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products (life insurance companies) below for sensitivity analysis which includes the sensitivity of reserves for guaranteed benefit features to changes in the assumptions for interest rates, equity market returns, volatility, and mortality. for additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features, see enterprise risk management - life insurance companies key insurance risks - variable annuity risk management and hedging program.
table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates the reserving methodology and assumptions used to measure the liabilities of our two largest guaranteed benefit features are presented in the following table:
guaranteed                                                                       reserving benefit feature                                                                 methodology &amp;
gmdb                                                                          we determine the gmdb liability at each balance sheet date by estimating the expected value of death benefits in excess of the projected account balance and recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected fee assessments. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on how we reserve for variable annuity products with guaranteed benefit features.
mortality rates, which are based upon actual experience modified to allow for variations in policy form
investment returns, using assumptions from a randomly generated model in applying asset growth assumptions for the valuation of the gmdb liability, we use a reversion to the mean methodology, similar to that applied for dac. for a description of this methodology, see estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products
gmwb                                                                          gmwb living benefits are embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from the host contract and carried at fair value. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on how we reserve for variable annuity products with guaranteed benefit features, and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information on fair value measurement of these embedded derivatives, including how we incorporate our own non-performance risk.
the fair value of the embedded derivatives is based on actuarial and capital market assumptions related to projected cash flows over the expected lives of the contracts. key assumptions include:
equity market returns
market volatility
credit spreads
equity / interest rate correlation
benefits and related fees assessed, when applicable
policyholder behavior, including mortality, lapses, withdrawals and benefit utilization. estimates of future policyholder behavior are subjective and based primarily on our historical experience
in applying asset growth assumptions for the valuation of gmwbs, we use market-consistent assumptions consistent with fair value measurement, which are calibrated to observable interest rate and equity option prices
estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products policy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal of existing insurance contracts related to universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are generally deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over a period that approximates the estimated lives of the contracts, except in instances where significant negative gross profits are expected in one or more periods. estimated gross profits include net investment income and spreads, net realized capital gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality gains and losses. in estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on dac amortization. for fixed deferred annuity contracts, the future spread between investment income and interest credited to policyholders is a significant judgment, particularly in a low interest rate environment.
if the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, dac and related reserves, including voba, sia, guaranteed benefit reserves and unearned revenue reserve (urr), are recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.
table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates below the long-term annual rate assumption impacts the growth assumption applied to the five-year period subsequent to the current balance sheet date. the reversion to the mean methodology allows us to maintain our long-term growth assumptions, while also giving consideration to the effect of actual investment performance.  when actual performance significantly deviates from the annual long-term growth assumption, as evidenced by growth assumptions for the five-year reversion to the mean period falling below a certain rate (floor) or above a certain rate (cap) for a sustained period, judgment may be applied to revise or "unlock" the growth rate assumptions to be used for both the five-year reversion to the mean period as well as the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods.  the use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry; however, the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary within the industry. see insurance reserves - life and annuity reserves and dac - reversion to the mean for additional discussion.
the following table summarizes the sensitivity of changes in certain assumptions for dac and sia, embedded derivatives and other reserves related to guaranteed benefits and urr, measured as the related hypothetical impact on december 31, 2016 balances and the resulting hypothetical impact on pre-tax income, before hedging.

we assess the collectability of reinsurance recoverable balances through either detailed reviews of the underlying nature of the reinsurance balance or comparisons with historical trends of disputes and credit events.  we record adjustments to reflect the results of these assessments through an allowance for uncollectable reinsurance that reduces the carrying amount of reinsurance assets on the balance sheet. this estimate requires significant judgment for which key considerations include:
see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on reinsurance.
impairment charges impairments of investments at each balance sheet date, we evaluate our available for sale securities holdings with unrealized losses to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred.  we also evaluate our other invested assets for impairment; these include equity and cost method investments in private equity funds, hedge funds and other entities as well as investments in life settlements, aircraft and real estate.
see the discussion in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the methodology and significant inputs, by investment type, that we use to determine the amount of impairment.
impairments on investments in life settlements impairments to investments in life settlements may occur in the future due to the fact that continued payment of premiums required to maintain policies will cause the expected lifetime undiscounted cash flows for some policies to be insufficient to recover our estimated future carrying amount, even in the absence of future changes to the mortality assumptions. impairments may also occur due to our future sale or lapse of select policies at a value that is below carrying amount.
goodwill impairment for a discussion of goodwill impairment, see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. in 2016, 2015 and 2014, aig elected to bypass the qualitative assessment of whether goodwill impairment may exist and, therefore, performed quantitative assessments that supported a conclusion that the fair value of all of the reporting units tested exceeded their book value. to determine fair value, we primarily use a discounted expected future cash flow analysis that estimates and discounts projected future distributable earnings.  such analysis is principally based on aig's business projections that inherently include judgments regarding business trends.
table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates such matters, particularly in cases that are in the early stages of litigation or in which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, we often cannot predict the outcome or estimate the eventual loss or range of reasonably possible losses related to such matters. given the inherent unpredictability of litigation, the outcome of certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
for more information on legal, regulatory and litigation matters, see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
fair value measurements of certain financial assets and financial liabilities see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the measurement of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities and our accounting policy regarding the incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurements.

level 3 assets and liabilities assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are measured and classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three "levels" based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair value. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the following table presents the amount of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3:
liabilities                   3.5          0.8                 3.1          0.8
level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable. we consider unobservable inputs to be those for which market data is not available and that are developed using the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use when valuing the asset or liability. our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.
we classify fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities as level 3 when they require significant unobservable inputs in their valuation, including contractual terms, prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates, default rates, mortality rates and correlations of such inputs.
see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the valuation methodologies for assets and liabilities measured at fair value, as well as a discussion of transfers of level 3 assets and liabilities.
income taxes recoverability of net deferred tax asset the evaluation of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. the weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. the more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.

we separately assess the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset related to unrealized tax capital losses in the u.s. life insurance companies' available for sale portfolio. the deferred tax asset relates to the unrealized losses for which the carryforward period has not yet begun, as such when assessing its recoverability we consider our ability and intent to hold the underlying securities to recovery.  as of december 31, 2016, based on all available evidence, we concluded that a valuation allowance should be established on a portion of the deferred tax asset related to unrealized losses that are not more-likely-than-not to be realized.
see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our framework for assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax asset.
uncertain tax positions our accounting for income taxes, including uncertain tax positions, represents management's best estimate of various events and transactions, and requires judgment.  fasb interpretation no. 48, "accounting for uncertainty in income taxes" (fin 48) (now incorporated into accounting standards codification, 740, income taxes) prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of an income tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties and additional disclosures. we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, based on technical merits, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recognized in the financial statements. a tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.

aig's outlook - industry and economic factors our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit and equity market conditions, catastrophic claims events, regulation, tax policy, competition, and general economic, market and political conditions. we continued to operate under difficult market conditions in 2016, characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates, instability in the global equity markets, volatile energy markets, slowing growth in china and euro-zone economies, and the united kingdom (the uk) advisory referendum in which a majority voted for the uk to withdraw its membership in the european union (the eu) (commonly referred to as brexit). the brexit vote has also affected the u.s. dollar/british pound exchange rate, increased the volatility of exchange rates among the euro, british pound and the japanese yen (the major currencies), and created volatility in the financial markets, which may continue for some time.
impact of changes in the interest rate environment interest rates increased late in 2016, but have remained at historically low levels. certain markets in which we operate have experienced negative interest rates. a sustained low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and may negatively impact the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments, including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios.  we actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through asset-liability management including spread management strategies for our investment-oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities.
table of contents item 7 | executive summary annuity sales and surrenders the sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry. low long-term interest rates put pressure on investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products.  however, our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. as long as the low interest rate environment continues, conditions will be challenging for the fixed annuity market. rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales, but may also drive higher surrenders. customers are, however, currently buying fixed annuities with longer surrender periods in pursuit of higher returns, which may help mitigate the rate of increase in surrenders in a rapidly rising rate environment. in addition, older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to the contract holders are driving better than expected persistency, although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio.  low interest rates have also driven growth in our fixed index annuity products, which provide additional interest crediting tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices and the availability of guaranteed living benefits. changes in interest rates significantly impact the valuation of our liabilities for guaranteed products with income features and the value of the related hedging portfolio.
reinvestment and spread management we actively monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. we also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in-force business. business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment. the low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to profitably price many of our products and puts margin pressure on existing products, due to the challenge of investing recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low rate environment while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity. in addition, there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in‐force business. specifically, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities.
the contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability. although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the asset‐liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability.
the following table presents fixed annuities and group retirement base net investment spread:
base net investment spread fixed annuities                 2.19    %   2.20    %   2.31   %
in fixed annuities and group retirement, average interest crediting rates decreased slightly in 2016 and 2015 compared to the preceding years due to active crediting rate management.  however, the decline in base investment yields, driven by investment purchases and investment of portfolio cash flows at rates below the weighted average yield of the existing portfolio in the sustained low interest rate environment, resulted in base spread compression. see investments for additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies.
for investment-oriented products in our individual retirement, group retirement, life insurance and institutional markets businesses, our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business, modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads, using asset-liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable, and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. we will continue to adjust crediting rates on in-force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields, but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment, contractual minimum crediting rates, and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre-established intervals. for example, competitors including private equity-held annuity writers are currently offering higher crediting rates.  as a result, the timing and extent of crediting rate decreases may differ from the corresponding declines in investment yields, which could reduce our spreads and future profitability.
table of contents item 7 | executive summary compared to 74 percent at december 31, 2015 and 79 percent at december 31, 2014. these businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to reduce the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales. in the core universal life business in our life insurance segment, 70 percent of the account values were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at december 31, 2016.

assumption updates and loss recognition spreads and surrender rates are important components of the future profit assumptions that drive the rate we use to amortize dac and related reserves for investment-oriented products. if future profit assumptions change significantly, we may be required to recalculate dac and related reserves, and reflect any resulting adjustments in current period income. in addition to investment-oriented products, certain traditional long-duration products for which we do not have the ability to adjust interest rates, such as structured settlements and payout annuities, are exposed to reduced earnings and potential loss recognition reserve increases in a sustained low interest rate environment. see insurance reserves - life and annuity reserves and dac - update of actuarial assumptions for discussion of such adjustments recorded in 2016, 2015 and 2014 in our consumer insurance and legacy life insurance run-off lines.
table of contents item 7 | executive summary not be able to adjust our future pricing consistent with our profitability objectives to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates. however, we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection.
in addition, for our commercial insurance segment and run-off insurance lines reported within the legacy portfolio, sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers' compensation, and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs; the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves.
additionally, sustained low interest rates on discounting of projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans may result in higher pension expense.
department of labor fiduciary rule our individual retirement and group retirement operating segments provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to restrictions imposed by erisa and the internal revenue code, including the requirements of the dol fiduciary rule.  for additional information about the dol fiduciary rule, see part i, item 1. business - regulation. we have been analyzing the dol fiduciary rule's potential impact on our customers, distribution partners, financial advisors and our individual retirement and group retirement businesses, and preparing to implement the necessary adjustments to achieve compliance with the dol fiduciary rule.  overall, the dol fiduciary rule as currently promulgated would result in increased compliance costs and, as currently promulgated, may create increased exposure to legal claims under certain circumstances, including class actions. the dol has also issued interpretive guidance on the dol fiduciary rule, and we are evaluating whether or not this guidance would affect the actions we would need to take to comply with the dol fiduciary rule.
on february 3, 2017, the new administration issued a memo requiring the dol to review the dol fiduciary rule and determine whether the dol fiduciary rule will adversely impact the ability of retirement savers to access information and financial advice.  accordingly, the dol announced that it would consider legal options for postponing the applicability date of the dol fiduciary rule while the dol considers the issues raised in the referenced memo. we are closely following the dol's pronouncements about further delays to the dol fiduciary rule's effective date.
impact of currency volatility currency volatility in 2016 and 2015 was acute compared to recent years, as the british pound weakened considerably against the u.s. dollar in 2016, although the japanese yen strengthened against the u.s. dollar.  the euro also weakened modestly against the u.s. dollar. such volatility affected line item components of income for those businesses with substantial international operations. in particular, growth trends in net premiums written reported in u.s. dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies. the net effect on underwriting results, however, is significantly mitigated, as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected.
these currencies may continue to fluctuate, in either direction, especially as a result of the uk's expected exit from the eu, and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in u.s. dollars, as well as financial statement line item comparability.

effect of foreign operations is primarily related to foreign exchange losses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries related to the weakening of the british pound following the brexit vote taxed at a statutory tax rate lower than 35 percent.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, our repatriation assumptions with respect to certain european operations remain unchanged and related foreign earnings continue to be indefinitely reinvested. our repatriation assumptions related to certain operations in canada, south africa and asia pacific region have changed and related foreign earnings are now considered to be indefinitely reinvested. these earnings relate to ongoing operations and have been reinvested in active non-u.s. business operations. further, we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund u.s. operations.  as a result, u.s. deferred taxes have not been provided on $2 billion of accumulated earnings, including accumulated other comprehensive income, of these non-u.s. affiliates. potential u.s. income tax liabilities related to such earnings would be offset, in whole or in part, by allowable foreign tax credits resulting from foreign taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions in which such operations are located.  as a result, we currently believe that any incremental u.s. income tax liabilities relating to indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings would not be significant. deferred taxes have been provided on earnings of non-u.s. affiliates whose earnings are not indefinitely reinvested. see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 32.3 percent. the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits of $195 million associated with tax exempt interest income, $127 million related to reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities, $58 million associated with the effect of foreign operations, and $109 million related to the partial completion of the irs examination covering tax year 2006, partially offset by $324 million of tax charges and related interest associated with increases in uncertain tax positions related to cross border financing transactions, and $110 million related to increases in the deferred tax asset valuation allowances associated with certain foreign jurisdictions. see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
table of contents item 7 | consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 27.9 percent.  the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits of $236 million associated with tax exempt interest income, $209 million related to a decrease in the u.s. life insurance companies' capital loss carryforward valuation allowance, $182 million of income excludible from gross income related to the global resolution of certain residential mortgage-related disputes and $68 million associated with the effect of foreign operations.

table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | commercial insurance competition and challenges operating in a highly competitive industry,  commercial insurance competes against several hundred companies, specialty  insurance organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations in the u.s. in international markets, we compete for business with the foreign  insurance operations of large global insurance groups and local companies in specific market areas and product types. insurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, service and terms and conditions. commercial insurance seeks to distinguish itself in the insurance industry primarily based on its well-established brand, global franchise, multinational capabilities, financial and capital strength, innovative products, claims expertise to handle complex claims, expertise in providing specialized coverages and customer service.
we serve our business and individual customers on a global basis - from the largest multinational corporations to local businesses and individuals. our clients benefit from our substantial underwriting expertise.
•     over capacity in certain lines of business creates downward market pressure on pricing;
•     tort environment volatility in certain jurisdictions and lines of business; and
•     volatility in claims arising from natural and man-made catastrophes.
liability and financial lines we have observed an increase in frequency of severity of losses, particularly in auto, which is impacting not only the primary books, but also having leverage impacts on excess layers.  loss cost trend rates across u.s. casualty lines in general are increasing with the exception of u.s. workers' compensation.  the market is still challenging in terms of the level of capacity, which is continuing to impact the rate environment.  the overall rates we have achieved have been positive across most business lines (in particular in auto where we have seen a large number of double digit increases as we have remediated underpriced business through a combination of product exits and use of reinsurance).  the current accident year deterioration has seen partial offsets as a result of actions taken in 2016 to grow higher value lines such as m&a and cyber.
liability and financial lines has large international exposure within the total commercial insurance portfolio and will therefore remain sensitive to volatility in foreign currencies.
property and special risks in 2016, property and special risks experienced growth in certain strategic high value businesses that led to positive results that met or exceeded our expectations, including u.s. middle market property, and we expect such growth to continue in 2017. the u.s. large limit property business continues to be a profitable investment area, and remains at volumes consistent with 2015. property and special risks also expects that expansion in certain growth economies will continue at a faster pace than in developed countries, but at levels lower than those previously expected due to revised economic assumptions.  rates in more commoditized lines of business such as u.s. excess and surplus lines continue to be unsatisfactory and we intend to continue to reduce our net premiums written in these areas.
overall, property and special risks experienced rate pressure in 2016, which is expected to continue in the near term, particularly in the u.s. and europe. property and special risks continues to differentiate its underwriting capacity from its peers by leveraging its global footprint, diverse product offering, risk engineering expertise and significant underwriting experience.
primarily due to reductions in the property portfolio driven by actions to address accounts with inadequate price and/or terms and conditions, catastrophe exposures have declined.

business and financial highlights the net premiums written decrease in 2016 was driven by the swiss re quota share treaty, portfolio optimization and execution on our pricing strategy, partially offset by growth in targeted lines of business. the increase in net losses was driven by net adverse prior year reserve development. the acquisition expense decrease was primarily related to the 2016 swiss re quota share treaty. the general operating expense decrease was driven by lower employee-related expenses and other expense savings initiatives. lower net investment income was driven primarily by lower alternative investment returns due to weaker performance in equity markets compared to prior years.
we continue to reduce the relative size of our u.s. casualty portfolio within liability and financial lines and consequently expect that net premiums written will continue to decline through 2017, in large part driven by the impact of our continued strategy on risk selection, disciplined underwriting and execution of our reinsurance strategy to further reduce risk.
as discussed in the executive summary, in january 2017, we entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with nico, which covers 80 percent of up to $9 billion of potential future prior year development on substantially all of our u.s. casualty and financial lines exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. under u.s. gaap, any potential future prior year development would be recognized immediately as losses are incurred; however, the related recoveries under the reinsurance agreement would be deferred and recognized over the expected recovery period.

adjusted business and financial highlights the net premiums written decrease in 2016 was driven by portfolio optimization and continued challenging market conditions, coupled with a decrease of assumed premiums related to the 50 percent quota share reinsurance agreement with united guaranty. this quota share reinsurance agreement contributed $146 million and $86 million to pre-tax operating income in 2016 and 2015, respectively.  the increase in net losses and loss ratio were driven by higher catastrophes and higher net adverse prior year loss reserve development, partially offset by lower severe losses. the expense ratio increase was mainly driven by business mix shift and premium reduction, which more than offset expense reduction. lower net investment income was driven primarily by lower alternative investment returns due to weaker performance in equity markets compared to prior years.
our sale of the ascot business at the end of 2016 will also lead to a decline in net premiums written in 2017.

competition and challenges consumer insurance operates in the highly competitive insurance and financial services industry in the u.s. and select international markets and competes against various financial services companies, including mutual funds, banks and  other  life  and  property  casualty insurance companies. competition  is  primarily  based  on  product  pricing  and  design,  distribution, financial strength, customer service and ease of doing business.
consumer insurance remains competitive due to its  long-standing  market leading  positions,  innovative  products,  distribution  relationships across multiple channels, customer-focused service, multi-national capabilities and strong financial ratings.
·         a sustained low interest rate environment, which makes it difficult to profitably price new products and puts margin pressure on existing business due to lower reinvestment yields;
·         increased competition in our primary markets, including aggressive pricing of annuities by private equity-backed annuity writers, increased competition and consolidation of employer groups in the group retirement planning market, and increased competition for auto and homeowners' insurance in japan;
·         investments to upgrade our technology and underwriting processes challenge our management of general operating expenses.
individual retirement increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs and fixed income securities are leading americans to seek additional financial security as they approach retirement. the strong demand for individual variable and fixed index annuities with guaranteed income features has attracted increased competition in  this product space. in  response  to  the  continued  low interest  rate environment, which  has  added pressure to profit margins, we have developed guaranteed income benefits for both variable and fixed index annuities with margins that are less sensitive  to  the  level of interest rates.
changes in the interest rate environment have a significant impact on sales, surrender rates, investment returns, guaranteed income features, and spreads in the annuity industry. see aig's outlook - industry and economic factors - changes in the interest rate environment for additional discussion of the impact of market interest rate movement on our individual retirement business.

life insurance consumers have increased needs for financial protection for beneficiaries, estate planning and wealth creation.  life insurance addresses the need for protection against the risk of premature death through a broad spectrum of products that include both term and permanent life insurance. in addition, life insurance offers products and benefits that offset other risks such as chronic and critical illness.
in response to a sustained low interest rate environment, life insurance has been actively re-pricing products and shifting its focus away from products with long-duration interest rate guarantees by introducing new products with shorter guarantees as well as indexed universal life products. see aig's outlook -industry and economic factors - changes in the interest rate environment for additional discussion of the impact of market interest rate movement on our life insurance business.
personal insurance the need  for full  life cycle  products and  coverage, increases in personal  wealth  accumulation,  and awareness of  insurance  protection and risk management  continue  to  support  the  growth  of the  personal  insurance  industry.  personal insurance  focuses  on group and corporate clients,  together  with  individual customers  within national markets. we expect  the demand for  multinational  cross-border  coverage  and  services to  increase due to  the  internationalization  of clients  and customers.  we believe our  global presence provides personal insurance  a  distinct competitive advantage.
in japan, the competition for auto insurance has intensified, in part driven by a decline in new car sales and the existence of fewer  but larger insurers.  in addition,  the overall  market size in  homeowners insurance contracted after the  duration restriction on long-term fire insurance became effective  in october 2015. in the u.s., we compete in the high net worth market  and will  continue to  expand  our  innovative  products and services to  distribution partners and  clients. outside  of japan  and  the u.s., our personal insurance  module  continues to  invest selectively in  markets, which we believe have higher potential for sustainable profitability.

business and financial highlights a diverse product portfolio enabled individual retirement to maintain industry-leading positions in annuity sales despite a challenging environment, which included an industry-wide slowdown primarily driven by uncertainty about the dol fiduciary rule, compared to strong variable and index annuity sales growth in 2015 and 2014. our total sales of index annuities slowed in 2016 but continued to outpace the industry. fixed annuities sales increased in 2016 as customers chose the safety of fixed returns in a period of equity volatility, but the sustained low interest rate environment, together with aggressive pricing by private equity-backed annuity writers, resulted in a modest decline in market share in 2016 and negative net flows for fixed annuities in 2016, 2015 and 2014. reinvestment in the low interest rate environment contributed to spread compression in fixed annuities, and net investment income results included volatility from alternative investments, mortgage loan prepayments, and fair value option assets. pre-tax operating income also included adjustments in each year to update actuarial assumptions, particularly from lower surrenders across all product lines. excluding such adjustments, net growth in average assets for variable and index annuities drove higher fee income, partially offset by increased dac amortization. the sale of aig advisor group in may 2016 resulted in decreases in advisory fee income, advisory fee expense and general operating expenses in 2016 compared to 2015, but did not result in a significant decrease in pre-tax operating income.

• higher net investment income primarily due to commercial mortgage loan prepayment income, growth in average invested assets and higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected, partially offset by lower income on alternative investments compared to 2015;
• better equity market performance which contributed to a decrease in policyholder benefit expense and dac amortization. this was partially offset by higher dac amortization, excluding the impact of actuarial assumption updates and equity market performance, which reflected a higher rate of amortization in fixed annuities and growth in index annuities;
• higher policy fee income due to growth in annuity account values from positive net flows; and
• a lower net positive adjustment from the review and update of actuarial assumptions, which was $92
• higher dac amortization in variable and index annuities due to growth in the business and lower equity market returns; and
• higher general operating expenses due in part to technology investments and higher expenses associated with continued strong sales in variable and index annuities.
these decreases were partially offset by higher policy fee income due to growth in annuity account values.
table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | consumer insurance individual retirement gaap premiums, premiums and deposits, surrenders and net flows for individual retirement, premiums primarily represent amounts received on life-contingent payout annuities. premiums increased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to higher rates in the first half of 2016. premiums decreased in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to lower market interest rates through october 2015.
premiums and deposits is a non‐gaap financial measure that includes, in addition to direct and assumed premiums, deposits received on investment-type annuity contracts and mutual funds under administration.
net flows for annuity products in individual retirement represent premiums and deposits less death, surrender and other withdrawal benefits. net flows for mutual funds represent deposits less withdrawals.

table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | consumer insurance individual retirement annuities are typically subject to a four- to seven-year surrender charge period, depending on the product. the increase in the amount and proportion of annuity reserves that have no surrender charge at december 31, 2016 compared to december 31, 2015 was primarily due to normal aging of this book of business, as well as lower than expected surrenders of older contracts with higher minimum interest rates on fixed account balances that have continued to be attractive to the contract holders in the low interest rate environment.  for variable and index annuities, the increase in reserves with higher surrender charges during these periods was due to positive net flows from these product lines during 2016. the increase in the amount of reserves within the surrender charge period, as well as uncertainty around the dol fiduciary rule, drove the improvement in the surrender rate in 2016 and 2015.
a discussion of the significant variances in premiums and deposits and net flows for each product line follows:
individual retirement premiums and deposits (p&amp;d)
• fixed annuities deposits increased in 2016 primarily due to higher sales in the bank and broker-dealer distribution channels as a result of customers favoring the safety of fixed annuities in response to equity market volatility. net flows were negative in 2016, but improved compared to 2015
• variable and index annuities net flows in 2016 were significantly lower due to a decrease in premiums and deposits, primarily due to lower sales of variable annuities, which reflected a strategic decision to scale back living benefits during the period of very low interest rates, as well as an industry-wide slowdown and uncertainty around the effect of the new dol fiduciary rule.
retail mutual funds net flows increased in 2016 due to improvement in the level of deposits, which was partially offset by higher surrenders, both driven by activity within the focused dividend strategy portfolio fund.
table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | consumer insurance individual retirement premiums and deposits and net flows
fixed annuities premiums and deposits increased in 2015 due to new product offerings and increases in market interest rates driven by widening credit spreads in the second half of the year, while net flows continued to be negative, primarily due to the sustained relatively low interest rate environment.
variable and index annuities premiums and deposits and net flows reflected lower variable annuities sales in 2015, due to market uncertainty around the dol fiduciary rule and equity market volatility, partially offset by an increase in index annuity sales.
retail mutual funds deposits increased in 2015, driven primarily by activity within the focused dividend strategy portfolio fund. in 2015, sales and withdrawals for this fund improved compared to a decline in 2014, due to a return to strong performance levels, which drove the growth in retail mutual funds net flows.

operating income business and financial highlights group retirement showed significant improvement in net flows in 2016 compared to 2015 and 2014, due to lower surrenders as well as record sales, resulting in part from its investment in talent, group plan administration record-keeping capabilities and digital functionality. pressure on investment spread from reinvestment in the low interest rate environment has been partially mitigated by effective crediting rate management. net investment income results included volatility from alternative investments, mortgage loan prepayments and fair value option assets. pre-tax operating income also included adjustments in each year to update actuarial assumptions.

group retirement annuities are typically subject to a five- to seven-year surrender charge period, depending on the product. the increase in the amount and proportion of group retirement annuity reserves that have no surrender charge at december 31, 2016 compared to december 31, 2015 was primarily due to normal aging of this book of business, as well as lower than expected surrenders of older contracts with higher minimum interest rates on fixed account balances that have continued to be attractive to the contract holders in the low interest rate environment.
table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | consumer insurance a discussion of the significant variances in premiums and deposits and net flows follows:
group retirement premiums and deposits and net flows
comparison net flows improved significantly due to both record deposits in 2016 and improved surrender activity, which included group plan surrenders of approximately $631 million in 2016 compared to $1.5 billion in 2015. the group plan market has been impacted by the consolidation of healthcare providers and other employers in target markets, but group plan acquisitions improved in 2016 compared to 2015, due in part to investments in talent, group plan administration record-keeping capabilities and digital functionality.
group retirement premiums and deposits and net flows
comparison net flows were negative in both periods but improved in 2015, primarily due to lower surrender activity. the improvement in the surrender rate was due in part to lower group plan surrenders, which were approximately
$1.5 billion in 2015, compared to $2.7 billion in 2014. group retirement's surrenders were impacted in both years by the consolidation of healthcare providers and other employers and increased competition in its target markets.

business and financial highlights life insurance new individual life sales in 2016 continued at prior year levels despite strategic actions to exit certain group benefits distribution channels. life insurance is focused on selling profitable new products through strategic channels to enhance future returns. pre-tax operating losses in 2016 and 2015 were primarily due to reserve increases from the update of actuarial assumptions and lower alternative investment income, as well as poor morbidity experience in the group business, which life insurance has addressed through strategic actions. we acquired aig life limited in the uk in december 2014, and sales growth with early year losses in this young organization has contributed to the pre-tax operating losses in life insurance. domestic general operating expenses decreased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the strategic decision to refocus the group benefits business and other reductions in staffing.
a lower net negative adjustment from the review and update of actuarial assumptions, which was $92 million in 2016 compared to $118 million in 2015, reflected in policy fees, policyholder benefits and amortization of dac;

underperforming group benefits results, including reserve increases and elevated morbidity experience;
increases to reserves for individual and group benefit products;

table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | consumer insurance life insurance pre-tax operating income (loss)
individual and group mortality experience that was less favorable than 2014;
international pre-tax operating losses in 2015, including higher general operating expenses, related to the expansion through the acquisitions of aig life limited and laya healthcare. the increase in expenses from these acquisitions was partially offset by domestic savings from organizational changes.
the increase in other income was due to commission and profit sharing revenues received by laya healthcare, acquired in march 2015, which was offset by related operating expenses.
life insurance gaap premiums and premiums and deposits premiums for life insurance represent amounts received on traditional life insurance policies, primarily term life, and group benefit policies. premiums increased 9 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased 8 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, primarily due to growth in international life and health, including the december 2014 acquisition of aig life limited in the uk.

business and financial highlights personal insurance operating results improved significantly in 2016 compared to 2015 and 2014, driven by the effective execution of strategic and portfolio actions to reduce total expenses, including refocusing direct marketing activities, while continuing underwriting actions and maintaining pricing discipline. in addition, while market competition in the personal insurance industry has intensified, the year-over-year stability of loss ratio and accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, reflected the underwriting quality, portfolio diversity, and low volatility of short-tailed risk in our personal insurance book.

• improved underwriting results driven by:
strategic actions to reduce expenses and refocus direct marketing activities; and
• lower underwriting results and lower net investment income reflecting reduced income on alternative investments. the lower underwriting results were driven by:
increase in other acquisition expenses, primarily related to investments to grow automobile and property businesses and higher profit share expenses related to warranty service programs, partially offset by a decrease in direct marketing expenses.

operating income business and financial highlights in 2015 and 2016, the legacy portfolio executed on several transactions that monetized approximately $7.1 billion of its portfolio.   approximately $6 billion came from external sales and internal securitizations of legacy investments to the insurance companies. the most significant transactions in 2016 were as follows:
•     on november 17, 2016, an aig sponsored fund (the korea fund) completed the sale of a mixed-use commercial complex in seoul, south korea commonly known as the seoul international finance center, to brookfield properties for total consideration of $2.5 billion, of which $1.2 billion was used to repay the fund's debt. the remaining cash proceeds were allocated between aig and the noncontrolling interests in accordance with the korea fund's partnership agreement.
•     on december 30, 2016, we sold a portion of our life settlements portfolio with face value (death benefits) of approximately $4.5 billion.
•     for certain attractive, high-yielding assets, a series of internal securitizations were completed with the insurance companies over the last two years.
in addition, the legacy run-off insurance business distributed to aig parent approximately $1.1 billion in the form of dividends and tax sharing payments resulting from reinsurance transactions. these transactions have helped to reduce the relative size of the legacy portfolio.
table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | legacy portfolio legacy portfolio pre-tax operating income
comparison pre-tax operating income remained relatively stable; however, there were fluctuations within the portfolios due to:
lower legacy life earnings in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower net investment income on investments and higher loss recognition on certain payout annuities from the update of actuarial assumptions;
lower legacy property and casualty pre-tax operating loss driven primarily by lower underwriting losses due to a decrease in net adverse prior year loss reserve development; and
lower legacy life earnings in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower returns on alternative investments in hedge funds and lower bond call and tender income. this was partially offset by a $20 million reduction in the reserve for ibnr death claims related to enhanced claims practices, compared with a $104 million increase in this reserve in 2014;
lower legacy property and casualty pre-tax operating income driven primarily by higher underwriting losses due to an increase in net adverse prior year loss reserve development; and
lower legacy investment pre-tax operating income driven primarily by lower appreciation on assets for which the fair value option was elected and lower fair value income on derivative positions.
table of contents item 7 | investments investments overview our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit. the investment objectives are driven by the respective business modules and aig parent. the primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products. the majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities.
narrowing of credit spreads more than offset the rise in interest rates, resulting in a net unrealized gain position in our investment portfolio. net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately $9.7 billion as of december 31,
we continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in mortgage loans with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income.
during 2016, we reduced our hedge fund portfolio by $3.2 billion as a result of redemptions consistent with our planned reduction of exposure. our alternative investments portfolio performance also experienced a decline in 2016 due to increased volatility in equity markets, primarily in the first quarter of 2016.
other-than-temporary impairments decreased due to lower impairments in our equity securities, available for sale.
we recognized gains on sales of securities in 2016, primarily due to the sale of a portion of our picc investment.
the u.s. election and brexit vote have created increased volatility in credit markets and exchange rates as well as within the equity markets, which may continue for some time.
investment strategies investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local and general market conditions, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification.
•     fixed maturity securities held by the u.s. insurance companies included in property casualty insurance companies consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk-return, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives.
•     outside of the u.s., fixed maturity securities held by property casualty insurance companies consist primarily of high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.
•     while more of a focus is placed on asset-liability management in life insurance companies, our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to optimize the duration characteristics of the assets within a target range based on comparable liability characteristics, to the extent practicable.
•     aig parent, included in other operations, actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. aig parent's liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities. based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, aig parent purchases publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. these securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.
table of contents item 7 | investments the following table presents the components of net investment income:
(a)  beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the presentation of income on alternative investments has been refined to include only income from hedge funds, private equity funds and affordable housing partnerships. prior period disclosures have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. hedge funds for which we elected the fair value option are recorded as of the balance sheet date. other hedge funds are generally reported on a one-month lag, while private equity funds are generally reported on a one-quarter lag.
(b)  includes changes in fair value of certain fixed maturity securities where the fair value option has been elected and which are used to economically hedge interest rate and other risks related to our variable annuity guaranteed living benefits. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the net investment income (loss) recorded on these securities was $120 million, $(43) million and $260 million, respectively.
net investment income in 2016 was marginally higher than 2015 as lower income on alternative investments and lower reinvestment yields were approximately offset by an increase in income on life settlements and higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected.
attribution of net investment income to product lines net investment income is attributed to our businesses based on internal models consistent with the nature of the underlying businesses.
for commercial insurance - liability and financial lines, property and special risks and consumer insurance - personal insurance, we estimate investable funds based primarily on loss reserves and unearned premiums. the allocation of net investment income of the property casualty insurance companies to modules is calculated based on these estimated investable funds, consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities and the capital allocation for each module.
for consumer insurance - individual retirement, group retirement, and life insurance, other operations - institutional markets and legacy life insurance run-off lines, net investment income is attributed based on invested assets from segregated product line portfolios held in our life insurance companies. all invested assets of the life insurance companies in excess of liabilities are allocated based on estimates of required economic capital for each product line.
asset liability measurement for the property casualty insurance companies, the duration of liabilities for long-tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines. as a result, the investment strategy within the property casualty insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital, subject to liability and other business considerations.
the property casualty insurance companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans. while invested assets backing reserves of the property casualty insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields, particularly in the domestic operations. in addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset-backed investments for their risk-return attributes, as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates. this asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged. we expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the property casualty insurance companies' liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk‐return and tax objectives.
in addition, the property casualty insurance companies seek to enhance returns through selective investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio.
table of contents item 7 | investments taxable municipal bonds, government and agency bonds, and corporate bonds. the majority of these high quality investments are rated a or higher based on composite ratings.
fixed maturity investments held in the property casualty insurance companies foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated a or higher based on composite ratings, with an average duration of 3.5 years.
the investment strategy of the life insurance companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value, subject to liquidity requirements, capital constraints, diversification requirements, asset‐liability management and available investment opportunities.
the life insurance companies use asset‐liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. the life insurance companies' fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified, high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that, to the extent practicable, complements the characteristics of liabilities, including duration, which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. the investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration.  an extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses, which may require us to further extend the duration of the investment portfolio.
the life insurance companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans.
in addition, the life insurance companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields.  while a diversified portfolio of alternative investments remains a fundamental component of the investment strategy of the life insurance companies, we intend to reduce the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio, in light of changing market conditions and perceived market opportunities, and to continue reducing the size of the private equity portfolio.
fixed maturity investments of the life insurance companies domestic operations, with an average duration of 6.8 years, are comprised primarily of taxable corporate bonds, as well as taxable municipal and government bonds, and agency and non‐agency structured securities. the majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on its composite ratings.
fixed maturity investments held in the life insurance companies foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated a or higher based on composite ratings, with an average duration of 21.2 years.
naic designations of fixed maturity securities the securities valuation office (svo) of the national association of insurance companies (naic) evaluates the investments of u.s. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called 'naic designations.' in general, naic designations of '1' highest quality, or '2' high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while naic designations of '3' through '6' generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade.  the naic has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities, including non-agency rmbs and cmbs, which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities.  these methodologies result in an improved naic designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies.  the following tables summarize the ratings distribution of u.s. insurance companies fixed maturity security portfolio by naic designation, and the distribution by composite aig credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies.  see investments - credit ratings herein for a full description of the composite aig credit ratings.

our investments in life settlements are monitored for impairment on a contract-by-contract basis quarterly. an investment in life settlements is considered impaired if the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the expected proceeds would not be sufficient to recover our estimated future carrying amount. this amount is defined as the current carrying amount for the investment in life settlements plus anticipated undiscounted future premiums and other capitalizable future costs, if any. impaired investments in life settlements are written down to their estimated fair value. this is determined on a discounted cash flow basis, incorporating current market mortality assumptions and market yields.
impairments on life settlements in 2015 were partially attributable to an increase in policy premiums required to keep policies in force which resulted in lower future expected net cash flows which were insufficient to recover our net investment on certain policies as well as our adoption of the society of actuaries 2015 valuation basic table (vbt) as the market mortality assumption used to measure the fair value of impaired policy.
other-than-temporary impairments to determine other-than-temporary impairments, we use fundamental credit analyses of individual securities without regard to rating agency ratings. based on this analysis, we expect to receive cash flows sufficient to cover the amortized cost of all below investment grade securities for which credit impairments were not recognized.

change in unrealized gains and losses on investments the change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in 2016 was primarily attributable to increases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. for 2016, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $0.9 billion due primarily to a narrowing of credit spreads, which more than offset the rise in rates.
the change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in 2015 was primarily attributable to decreases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. for 2015, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities decreased by $10.2 billion due primarily to the rise in rates, widening of credit spreads, and the sale of equity securities.

(a)  in 2016 and 2015 includes realized gains on the sale of a portion of our holdings in people's insurance company (group) of china limited and picc property & casualty company limited (collectively, our picc investment).
net realized capital losses in 2016 were primarily related to foreign exchange losses, derivative losses, and impairments, which were higher than the gain recognized on the sale of a portion of our picc investment.
foreign exchange gains (losses) were primarily due to $910 million of remeasurement losses in 2016 for a short term intercompany balance that was matched with available for sale investments in fixed maturity securities denominated in the same foreign currencies. unrealized gains and losses on the available for sale investments were recorded in other comprehensive income resulting in an immaterial impact on our overall equity or book value per share from this arrangement.
derivative and hedge accounting losses were primarily a result of the fair value changes in derivative instruments used to economically hedge market risk from variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (gmwb), which were adversely impacted by rising interest rates and equity market performance late in the fourth quarter of 2016. see enterprise risk management - life insurance companies key insurance risks - variable annuity risk management and hedging program for additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features and insurance reserves - life and annuity reserves and dac - variable annuity guaranteed benefits and hedging results for more information on the economic hedging target and the impact to pre-tax income of this program.
net realized capital gains in 2015 were primarily driven by foreign exchange gains which included $243 million of gains in 2015, related to the intercompany notional cash pooling arrangement, discussed above and net gains on the sales of various securities such as the class b shares of prudential financial, inc., common shares of onemain holdings and sales of our picc investment. these realized gains were partially offset by realized losses related to the sale of ordinary shares of aercap.
net realized capital gains in 2014 were primarily driven by capital gains from sales of investments related to capital loss carryforward utilization and fair value losses on embedded derivatives related to variable annuity guarantee features, net of hedges.

•     higher than expected losses emerging across several casualty classes, especially in the recent accident years (generally, 2011 to 2015) driven by increased frequency and severity of claims. this recent accident year loss emergence caused us to increase loss development factors applied across many accident years.

in the tables below, we present prior year development in accident year groupings of 2005 and prior, 2006 - 2010 and 2011 - 2015. the grouping 2005 and prior represents the period ending with the 2005 restatement of our consolidated financial statements. the period 2006 - 2010 includes the years leading up to and immediately following the financial crisis. the period in 2011 - 2015 includes the periods during which we completed the recapitalization of aig and began exiting u.s. government ownership which was completed in 2012.
see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further details of prior year development by line of business.   see also critical accounting estimates for a discussion of actuarial methods employed for major classes of business.
table of contents item 7 | insurance reserves net loss development by accident years for 2016, the adverse prior year development was primarily driven by:
•     accident years 2011 to 2015 - adverse development of $3.1 billion were primarily driven by u.s. other casualty (commercial automobile liability, general liability and medical malpractice), u.s. excess casualty, u.s. workers' compensation, and u.s. special risks programs business.  as discussed more fully in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements these lines experienced adverse actual versus expected loss activity and higher loss trends, and we responded by increasing our expected loss development tail factors.
•     accident years 2005 and prior - adverse development of $1.3 billion was driven by increased loss development factors in u.s. workers' compensation and u.s. other casualty general liability.
•     accident years 2011 to 2014 - adverse development of $1.6 billion was driven by significantly higher actual versus expected loss emergence.  we responded by increasing expected loss ratios for u.s. excess casualty, u.s. other casualty, international liability and financial lines and u.s. workers' compensation. in addition, our updated assumptions for bad-faith claims and unallocated loss adjustment expenses disproportionately impacted these years.
for certain categories of claims (e.g., construction defect claims and environmental claims) and for reinsurance recoverable, losses may sometimes be reclassified to an earlier or later accident year as more information about the date of occurrence becomes available to us. these reclassifications are shown as development in the respective years in the tables above.  this may affect the comparability of the data presented in our tables.
significant new reinsurance agreements effective january 1, 2016, we entered into a two-year reinsurance arrangement with the swiss reinsurance company ltd, under which we ceded a proportional share of our new and renewal u.s. casualty portfolio in order to reduce the concentration of casualty business in our portfolio.
on january 20, 2017, we entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with nico, a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway inc., under which we transferred to nico 80 percent of the reserve risk on substantially all of our u.s. commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. under this agreement, we ceded to nico 80 percent of the paid losses on subject business paid on or after january 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion.  at nico's 80 percent share, nico's limit of liability under the contract is $20 billion.  we will account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. the consideration for this agreement is $9.8 billion plus interest at 4 percent per annum from january 1, 2016 to date of payment, which was paid in full as of february 17, 2017. the consideration paid to nico will be placed into a collateral trust account as security for nico's claim payment obligations, and berkshire hathaway inc. has provided a parental guarantee to secure the obligations of nico under the agreement.
table of contents item 7 | insurance reserves the following table calculates the amount of the deferred gain expected to be recorded in the first quarter of 2017, on a nominal and net basis and showing the effect of discounting of loss reserves, using the reserve position of december 31, 2016.  the stated effective date of the agreement is january 1, 2016, and therefore losses paid on subject business during 2016 are included in the calculation.  the deferred gain will be amortized over the settlement period of the reinsured losses.
the lines of business subject to this agreement have been the source of substantially all of the prior year adverse development charges over the past several years. the agreement is expected to result in lower capital charges for reserve risks at our u.s. insurance subsidiaries.  under u.s. gaap, any potential future prior year development would be recognized immediately as losses are incurred; however, the related recoveries under the reinsurance agreement would be deferred and recognized over the expected recovery period.  in addition, we would expect future net investment income to decline as a result of lower invested assets.

life and annuity reserves and dac the following section provides discussion of life and annuity reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs.
update of actuarial assumptions the life insurance companies review and update estimated gross profit assumptions used to amortize dac and related items for investment-oriented products at least annually. estimated gross profit assumptions include net investment income and spreads, net realized capital gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality gains and losses. if the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, dac and related reserves (which may include voba, sia, guaranteed benefit reserves and unearned revenue reserves) are recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products. the update of actuarial assumptions in 2016, 2015 and 2014 also included adjustments to reserves for universal life with secondary guarantees.
the update of actuarial assumptions in 2016, 2015 and 2014 included adjustments for products now reported in the legacy portfolio, primarily loss recognition expense related to pre-2010 payout annuities and certain long-term care products. assumptions related to investment yields, mortality experience and expenses for long-duration traditional products are reviewed periodically and updated as appropriate, which could result in additional loss recognition reserves.
the update of actuarial assumptions in 2016, 2015 and 2014 included adjustments to the valuation of variable annuity gmwb features that are accounted for as embedded derivatives and measured at fair value, which are primarily in variable annuities and group retirement products. changes in the fair value of such embedded derivatives are recorded in net realized capital gains (losses) and, together with related dac adjustments and fair value changes in the gmwb hedging portfolio, are excluded from pre-tax operating income. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the measurement of fair value for gmwb embedded derivatives, and variable annuity guaranteed benefit and hedging results for additional discussion of the assumption updates for variable annuity gmwb.

in 2016, pre-tax operating income included a net negative adjustment of $384 million, primarily driven by $622 million of loss recognition reserves for pre-2010 payout annuities in the legacy portfolio, and an increase in life insurance reserves for universal life with secondary guarantees. these negative adjustments were partially offset by positive adjustments, primarily lower surrender assumptions in fixed annuities.
in 2015, pre-tax operating income in the aggregate was reduced by $6 million as a result of the update of actuarial assumptions. this aggregate net adjustment of $6 million included a net negative adjustment of $118 million in life insurance, which was offset in large part by net positive adjustments of $92 million in fixed annuities and $48 million in group retirement.
in 2014, pre-tax operating income in the aggregate was increased by $129 million as a result of the update of assumptions, primarily due to net positive adjustments related to investment spread assumptions in the fixed annuities and group retirement businesses, partially offset by loss recognition for long-term care business in the legacy portfolio and additions to reserves for universal life with secondary guarantees in life insurance.
update of actuarial assumptions by business module individual retirement the update of actuarial assumptions resulted in net positive adjustments to pre-tax operating income of individual retirement of $369 million, $92 million and $200 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
in fixed annuities, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net positive adjustment of $330 million in 2016, which reflected lower surrender assumptions, primarily due to lower long-term interest rates, as well as updates to investment yield and crediting rate assumptions compared to those previously modeled. in 2015, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions in fixed annuities resulted in a net positive adjustment of $92 million, which reflected refinements to investment spread assumptions, lower terminations than previously assumed and decreases to expense assumptions. in 2014, a net positive adjustment of $196 million in fixed annuities was primarily due to better spreads than previously assumed.
table of contents item 7 | insurance reserves in variable and index annuities, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net positive adjustment of $39 million in 2016, primarily due to favorable updates to assumptions for long-term volatility, surrenders, mortality and policy expenses, partially offset by a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 8.5 percent to 7.5 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected). the net positive adjustment in 2016 included a net negative adjustment of approximately $24 million in connection with the conversion to a more robust modeling platform for variable annuities, primarily due to refinements to assumptions for guaranteed minimum interest rates and investment fees, partially offset by the impact of other refinements identified during the conversion. in 2015, there were offsetting updates to assumed investment fees, modeled expenses, and terminations, resulting in no net adjustment to pre-tax operating income in variable and index annuities compared to a $4 million net positive adjustment in 2014, which reflected the update of estimated gross profit assumptions.
group retirement in group retirement, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net negative adjustment of $47 million in 2016, primarily due to refinements in surrender and partial withdrawal assumptions and a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 8.5 percent to 7.5 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected). in 2015, a net positive adjustment from the update of estimated gross profit assumptions of $48 million in group retirement was primarily due to revisions to mortality and surrender assumptions, partially offset by decreased spread assumptions. in 2014, a net positive adjustment of $46 million in group retirement was primarily due to more favorable assumptions for investment spreads and surrenders than previously assumed.
life insurance in life insurance, the update of actuarial assumptions resulted in a net negative adjustment of $92 million in 2016. this adjustment was primarily due to refinement to reserves for universal life insurance with secondary guarantees due to lower assumed surrender rates. the update to life insurance assumptions also included lower yield and interest credited assumptions.
in 2015, the net negative adjustment of $118 million related to the update of actuarial assumptions in life insurance was primarily due to lower assumed surrender rates for certain later-duration universal life with secondary guarantees. the net negative adjustment also reflected lower investment spread assumptions, partially offset by more favorable than expected mortality.
a net negative adjustment of $32 million in life insurance in 2014 was primarily due to additions to reserves for universal life with secondary guarantees, as a result of lower investment spread and mortality assumptions which, while higher than previously assumed, were still within pricing assumptions.
legacy portfolio the update of actuarial assumptions resulted in $622 million of loss recognition expense in 2016 on payout annuities in the legacy life insurance run-off lines. the loss recognition reflected the establishment of additional reserves primarily as a result of mortality experience studies, which indicated increased longevity, particularly on injured lives on a block of structured settlements underwritten prior to 2010. the mortality assumption update did not impact reserves for structured settlements and terminal funding annuities written after april 2012, which are in the institutional markets business.
legacy life insurance run-off lines recorded loss recognition expense of $28 million and $87 million to increase reserves for certain long-term care business in 2015 and 2014, respectively, which reduced pre-tax operating income in those periods. the loss recognition for both periods was primarily a result of lower future premium increase assumptions and, in 2014, lower yield assumptions.
variable annuity guaranteed benefits and hedging results our individual retirement and group retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with gmwb riders that provide guaranteed living benefit features. the liabilities for gmwb are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value. the fair value of the embedded derivatives may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility.
in addition to risk-mitigating features in our variable annuity product design, we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from gmwb, including exposures to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and volatilities. the hedging program utilizes derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts and interest rate swap and swaption contracts, as well as fixed maturity securities with a fair value election. see enterprise risk management - life insurance companies key insurance risks - variable annuity risk management and hedging program for additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features.
table of contents item 7 | insurance reserves differences in valuation of embedded derivatives and economic hedge target the variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our gmwb riders. the economic hedge target differs from the u.s. gaap valuation of the gmwb embedded derivatives due to the following:
•     the economic hedge target includes 100 percent of rider fees in present value calculations; the u.s. gaap valuation reflects only those fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero;
•     the economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for u.s. gaap valuation, such as margins for policyholder behavior, mortality, and volatility; and
•     the economic hedge target excludes the non-performance or "own credit" risk adjustment (npa) used in the u.s. gaap valuation, which reflects a market participant's view of our claims-paying ability by incorporating an additional spread (the npa spread) to the swap curve used to discount projected benefit cash flows. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our valuation methodology for embedded derivatives within policyholder contract deposits. because the discount rate includes the npa spread and other explicit risk margins, the u.s. gaap valuation is generally less sensitive to movements in interest rates and other market factors, and to changes from actuarial assumption updates, than the economic hedge target.
the market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting. in addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program, the life insurance companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees.  the primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include:
•     basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns, which may be either positive or negative;
•     realized volatility versus implied volatility;
•     risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge.

hedge target liability impact on pre-tax income (loss)
the impact on our pre-tax income (loss) of the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits and related hedging results include changes in the fair value of the gmwb embedded derivatives, and changes in the fair value of related derivative hedging instruments, both of which are recorded in other realized capital gains (losses). realized capital gains (losses), as well as net investment income from changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities used in the hedging program, are excluded from pre-tax operating income of individual retirement and group retirement.
the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting, primarily due to the differences in valuation between the economic hedge target, the u.s. gaap embedded derivatives, and changes in the fair value of the hedging portfolio, as discussed above. when corporate credit spreads widen, the change in the npa spread generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a gain, and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten, the change in the npa spread generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a loss. in addition to changes driven by credit market-related movements in the npa spread, the npa balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits.

the net impact on pre-tax income from the gmwb and related hedges in 2016 (excluding related dac amortization) was primarily driven by actuarial assumption updates to surrender and mortality assumptions. the 2015 and 2014 net impacts were primarily driven by changes in the npa spread. in addition, the impact of rising interest rates and equity markets late in the fourth quarter of 2016 resulted in fair value losses in the hedging portfolio, which were not offset by decreases in the embedded derivative liabilities, because risk margins and other assumptions used for u.s. gaap valuation cause the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to changes in market rates than the hedge portfolio. the changes in the economic hedge target and the largely offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedge portfolio were primarily driven by changes in equity markets and interest rates, as discussed below.
change in economic hedge target the increase in the economic hedge target in 2016 was primarily due to the update of actuarial assumptions offset by reductions from positive equity markets and increases in market interest rates, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2016.  a decrease in market interest rates, lower equity market performance and the update of actuarial assumptions in 2015 resulted in increases in economic hedge target, which were significantly offset by changes in the value of the hedging portfolio. the increases in the economic hedge target in 2014 were primarily due to declines in interest rates and the update of actuarial assumptions, partially offset by higher equity market returns.
change in fair value of the hedging portfolio the changes in the fair value of the economic hedge target and, to a lesser extent, the embedded derivatives, were offset in part by the following changes in the fair value of the variable annuity hedging portfolio:
•     changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities, for which the fair value option has been elected, are used as a capital-efficient way to economically hedge interest rate and credit spread-related risk. effective june 30, 2015, we discontinued our u.s. treasury bond interest rate hedging program and initiated a corporate bond hedging program, which is intended to provide the same capital efficiency as the previous u.s. treasury bond hedging program. the change in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program in 2016 included gains, primarily due to credit spreads tightening and decreases in market interest rates in the first nine months of 2016, partially offset by an increase in rates in the fourth quarter of 2016. the change in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program in 2015 reflected losses, primarily due to increases in market interest rates in the first six months of 2015 and credit spreads widening. the gains in 2014 from the change in the fair value of the fixed maturities securities were due to decreases in market interest rates in 2014. the change in the fair value of the hedging bonds, which is excluded from the pre-tax operating income of the individual retirement and group retirement segments, is reported in net investment income on the consolidated statements of income (loss).
•     the change in the fair value of equity derivative contracts, which included futures and options, resulted in losses in 2016, 2015 and 2014, which varied based on the relative growth in equity market returns in the respective years.
table of contents item 7 | insurance reserves change in npa spread in 2016, tightening of credit spreads resulted in a negative impact on pre-tax income from the change in the npa spread. in 2015, the impact of widening credit spreads resulted in a significant gain from the change in npa spread, which was the primary driver of the net positive impact on pre-tax income, compared to a less significant gain from the change in npa spread in 2014.
update of actuarial assumptions the change in embedded derivatives included increases in 2016 due to the update of actuarial assumptions, which primarily reflected lower surrender and mortality assumptions, partially offset by a decrease due to updated assumptions for utilization of withdrawal benefits. the impact of these updated assumptions, which were based on experience studies, was less significant to the embedded derivative liabilities than to the economic hedge target, because the discount rates used to value the embedded derivatives include the additional adjustment for the npa spread, as well as other explicit risk margins. in addition, the increase in the embedded derivative liabilities from the assumption updates was largely offset by a reduction due to an update of these risk margins. see update of actuarial assumptions for the amount of adjustments included in net capital realized gains (losses) related to the update of actuarial assumptions for gmwb.
dac the following table summarizes the major components of the changes in dac, including voba, within the life insurance companies, excluding dac of institutional markets and legacy portfolio:

(a)  dac other in 2014 represents voba related to the acquisition of aig life limited.
the net adjustments to dac amortization from the update of actuarial assumptions for estimated gross profits, including those reported within change in dac related to net realized capital gains (losses), represented four percent and one percent of the dac balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
reversion to the mean in 2016, we updated the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods used in our reversion to the mean methodology for estimating future estimated gross profits for variable annuity products, from 8.5 percent to 7.5 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected). the five-year reversion to the mean period has not met the criteria for adjustment in 2016, 2015 or 2014; however, sustained favorable equity market performance in excess of long-term assumptions could result in unlocking in the individual retirement or group retirement variable annuity product lines in the future, with a positive effect on pre-tax income in the period of the unlocking. see critical accounting estimates - estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products (life insurance companies) for additional discussion of assumptions related to our reversion to the mean methodology.
table of contents item 7 | insurance reserves dac and reserves related to unrealized appreciation of investments dac for universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the change in dac as if securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (shadow dac). shadow dac generally moves in the opposite direction of the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, reducing the reported dac balance when market interest rates decline. market interest rates as of december 31, 2016 decreased compared to december 31, 2015 as a result of narrowing spreads in 2016. as a result, the unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities held in the life insurance companies that support the core portfolio businesses at december 31, 2016 increased by $2.1 billion compared to december 31, 2015, which resulted in a decrease in dac to reflect the shadow dac adjustment.

table of contents item 7 | liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources overview liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations.  it is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. we manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity risk framework established by enterprise risk management (erm). our liquidity risk framework is designed to manage liquidity at both aig parent and subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six-months under a liquidity stress scenario. see enterprise risk management - risk appetite, limits, identification, and measurement and enterprise risk management - liquidity risk management below for additional information.
capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. our primary source of ongoing capital generation is the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. we must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. these constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy for both aig and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using erm's stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both aig and our insurance subsidiaries.
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events.
nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources as was the case in 2008. additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs and loss of sources of liquidity and capital. in addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.
depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. liability management actions may include, but are not limited to, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, paying dividends to our shareholders and share repurchases.
table of contents item 7 | liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources activity for 2016
sources aig parent funding from subsidiaries during 2016, aig parent received $7.5 billion in dividends and loan repayments from subsidiaries. of this amount, $2.2 billion was dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our property casualty insurance companies, $4.7 billion was dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our life insurance companies and $571 million was dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from ugc.
billion in tax sharing payments in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our insurance businesses in 2016, reflecting $608 million that was reimbursed by aig parent to our insurance businesses during the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of adjustments made to prior-year tax sharing payments. the tax sharing payments may continue to be subject to adjustment in future periods.
the dividends and tax sharing payments from our property casualty companies and life insurance companies were funded, in part, by proceeds from the sale of 740 million ordinary h shares of picc property &amp; casualty company limited for approximately $1.25 billion in may 2016 and by the sale of aig advisor group in may 2016.
billion in return of capital from legacy investments.
aig parent funding to subsidiaries in january 2016, aig parent made a capital contribution of approximately $2.9 billion to our property casualty insurance companies.
*    under exchange act rule 10b5-1 repurchase plans, from january 1 to february 14, 2017, we repurchased approximately $1.2 billion of additional shares of aig common stock. as of february 14, 2017, approximately $4.7 billion remained under our share repurchase authorization.
table of contents item 7 | liquidity and capital resources analysis of sources and uses of cash the following table presents selected data from aig's consolidated statements of cash flows:

operating cash flow activities insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits. the ability of insurance companies to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under their insurance policies, policy retention rates and operating expenses.
interest payments totaled $1.3 billion in 2016 compared to $1.4 billion in 2015 and $3.4 billion in 2014. excluding interest payments, aig generated positive operating cash flow of $3.7 billion in 2016 compared to $4.2 billion and $8.4 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
table of contents item 7 | liquidity and capital resources investing cash flow activities net cash provided by investing activities in 2016 included approximately $2.8 billion of net cash proceeds from the sale of ugc, ascot and aig advisor group. net cash provided by investing activities for 2015 included approximately $4.2 billion of net cash proceeds from the sale of ordinary shares of aercap. net cash provided by investing activities in 2014 included a reduction in net investment purchase activity and approximately $2.4 billion of net cash proceeds from the sale of ilfc.

liquidity and capital resources of aig parent and subsidiaries aig parent as of december 31, 2016, aig parent had approximately $12.9 billion in liquidity sources. aig parent's liquidity sources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. fixed maturity securities primarily include u.s. government and government sponsored entity securities, u.s. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. aig parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. based upon an assessment of funding needs, the liquidity sources can be readily monetized through sales, repurchase agreements or contributed as admitted assets to regulated insurance companies. aig parent liquidity is monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. aig parent's primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries and credit facilities.  aig parent's primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, and operating expenses.
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy our reasonably foreseeable future requirements and meet our obligations to our creditors, debt-holders and insurance company subsidiaries. we expect to access the debt markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.
we utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our insurance operations. should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic growth or acquisition opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or share repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management.
table of contents item 7 | liquidity and capital resources with businesses or investments that do not directly support our insurance operations may be available for distribution to shareholders or deployment towards liability management upon its monetization.
in developing plans to distribute capital, aig considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to: aig's business and strategic plans, expectations for capital generation and utilization, aig's funding capacity and capital resources in comparison to internal benchmarks, as well as rating agency expectations, regulatory standards and internal stress tests for capital.
in january 2016, aig parent made a capital contribution of approximately $2.9 billion to our property casualty insurance companies as a result of our fourth quarter 2015 reserve strengthening.

(b)  unencumbered securities consist of publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. fixed maturity securities primarily include u.s. government and government sponsored entity securities, u.s. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities.
(c)  for additional information relating to this syndicated credit facility, see credit facilities below.
insurance companies we expect that our insurance companies will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. our insurance companies' liquidity resources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.
each of our material insurance companies' liquidity is monitored through various internal liquidity risk measures.  the primary sources of liquidity are premiums, fees, reinsurance recoverables and investment income. the primary uses of liquidity are paid losses, reinsurance payments, benefit claims, surrenders, withdrawals, interest payments, dividends, expenses, investments and collateral requirements.
our property casualty insurance companies may require additional funding to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances.  large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to our affected operations. downgrades in our credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, which could result in non‐renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary's ability to meet its own obligations. increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include an economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval.
aig parent and ascot corporate name limited (acnl) were previously parties to a $725 million letter of credit facility. the letter of credit facility was released at the closing of aig's sale of its interest in ascot underwriting holdings ltd. and acnl in november 2016.
management believes that because of the size and liquidity of our life insurance companies' investment portfolios, normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not create significant liquidity risk. furthermore, our life insurance companies' products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk, including surrender charges. however, as we saw in 2008, in times of extreme capital markets disruption, liquidity needs could outpace resources. as part of their risk management framework, our life insurance companies continue to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue strategies and programs to improve their liquidity position and facilitate their ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio.
table of contents item 7 | liquidity and capital resources amount of approximately $2 million at both december 31, 2016 and 2015. in addition to these borrowings outstanding at december 31, 2016, $429 million was due to the fhlb of dallas under funding agreements issued by our institutional markets business in 2016, which were reported in policyholder contract deposits.
certain of our u.s. life insurance companies have programs, which began in 2012, that lend securities from their investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. under these programs, these u.s. life insurance companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. cash collateral received is invested in short-term investments. additionally, the aggregate amount of securities that a life insurance company is able to lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account statutory-basis admitted assets. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, our u.s. life insurance companies had $2.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of securities subject to these agreements and $2.5 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of liabilities to borrowers for collateral received.
aig generally manages capital between aig parent and our insurance companies through internal, board-approved policies and limits, as well as management standards. in addition, aig parent has unconditional capital maintenance agreements (cmas) in place with certain subsidiaries. nevertheless, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer capital freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.
aig parent is party to a cma with agc life insurance company. among other things, the cma provides that aig parent will maintain the total adjusted capital of agc life insurance company at or above a specified minimum percentage of its projected naic company action level risk-based capital (rbc). as of december 31, 2016, the specified minimum percentage under this cma was 250 percent. aig parent terminated the cma with united guaranty residential insurance company in connection with the december 2016 closing of the sale of ugc.
during 2016, we created a new switzerland-domiciled international holding company, aig international holdings, gmbh (aigih), that is intended to be the ultimate holding company for all of our international entities. this new international holding company structure is part of our ongoing efforts to simplify our organizational structure, and is expected to facilitate the optimization of our international capital strategy from both a regulatory and tax perspective. through february 14, 2017, the following international operations have been transferred to aigih: europe, canada, asia pacific (excluding japan) and latin america/caribbean.
in 2016, our property casualty insurance companies paid approximately $2.2 billion in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities to aig parent. the fixed maturity securities primarily included u.s. government and government-sponsored entity securities, u.s. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities.
in 2016, our u.s. life insurance companies paid approximately $4.7 billion of dividends and loan repayments in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities to aig parent, which included the release of approximately $1.0 billion of excess statutory capital resulting from a reinsurance agreement entered into by one of the life insurance companies involving certain of its whole life and universal life businesses, effective july 1, 2016. the fixed maturity securities primarily included u.s. government and government sponsored entity securities, u.s. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. the reinsurance agreement also resulted in a $49 million tax payment to aig parent. effective december 31, 2016, the same life subsidiary recaptured certain term and universal life reserves previously ceded to an affiliate and ceded approximately $14 billion of such statutory reserves to an unaffiliated reinsurer under an amendment to the july 1, 2016 agreement, which is expected to result in a tax payment to aig parent of approximately $2.3 billion in 2017.
in 2016, ugc paid approximately $571 million in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities to aig parent. the fixed maturity securities primarily included u.s. government and government-sponsored entity securities, u.s. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities.
credit facilities we maintain a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility (the facility) as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. the facility provides for aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide unsecured revolving loans and/or standby letters of credit of up to $4.5 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings and is scheduled to expire in november 2020.
as of december 31, 2016, a total of $4.5 billion remains available under the facility. our ability to borrow under the facility is not contingent on our credit ratings. however, our ability to borrow under the facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the facility. these include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the facility would restrict our access to the facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we expect to borrow under the facility from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.

(a)  primarily includes contracts to purchase future services and other capital expenditures.
(b)  does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $4.5 billion, the timing of which is uncertain.
insurance and investment contract liabilities insurance and investment contract liabilities, including gic liabilities, relate to our life insurance companies. these liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments. these liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. for these policies and contracts (i) we are not currently making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event beyond our control.
we have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits. these assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force policies. due to the significance of the assumptions, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. the amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the consolidated balance sheets.
table of contents item 7 | liquidity and capital resources expect liquidity needs related to gic liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets.
borrowings our borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. we expect to repay the long-term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by aig through maturing investments and dispositions of invested assets, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt issuance and other financing arrangements. borrowings supported by assets of aig include various notes and bonds payable as well as gias that are supported by cash and investments held by aig parent and certain non-insurance subsidiaries for the repayment of those obligations.

(a)  moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 to the generic rating categories to show relative position within the rating categories.
(b)  s&p ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.
(c)  fitch ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.
these credit ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. they may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. ratings may also be withdrawn at our request.
we are party to some agreements that contain "ratings triggers." depending on the ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies, these triggers could result in (i) the termination or limitation of credit availability or a requirement for accelerated repayment, (ii) the termination of business contracts or (iii) a requirement to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.
in the event of adverse actions on our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies, aigfp and certain other aig entities would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative transactions or could experience termination of the transactions. such requirements and terminations could adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or our liquidity. in the event of a further downgrade of aig's long-term senior debt ratings, aigfp and certain other aig entities would be required to post additional collateral, and certain of the counterparties of aigfp or of such other aig entities would be permitted to terminate their contracts early.
the actual amount of collateral that we would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.

our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of shares of aig common stock through a series of actions. on november 2, 2016, our board of directors authorized an additional increase of $3.0 billion to the share repurchase authorization.
during 2016, we repurchased approximately 201 million shares of aig common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $11.5 billion pursuant to this authorization, and we repurchased 17 million warrants to purchase shares of aig common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $309 million pursuant to this authorization. under exchange act rule 10b5-1 repurchase plans, from january 1 to february 14, 2017, we repurchased approximately $1.2 billion of additional shares of aig common stock.
on february 14, 2017, our board of directors authorized an additional increase of $3.5 billion to the share repurchase authorization, resulting in a remaining authorization on such date of approximately $4.7 billion. shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market, private purchases, through forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise (including through the purchase of warrants).  certain of our share repurchases have been and may from time to time be effected through exchange act rule 10b5-1 repurchase plans. the timing of any future share repurchases will depend on market conditions, our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors, including the regulatory framework applicable to us.
dividend restrictions payments of dividends to aig by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities. see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of restrictions on payments of dividends by our subsidiaries.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management enterprise risk management risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns. we consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance.
overview we have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm‐wide risk appetite. our board of directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. our enterprise risk management (erm) department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of aig's major risk positions. within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk‐taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by erm. erm supports our businesses and management in the embedding of risk management in our key day-to-day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing, monitoring and reporting, and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses. nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur.
risk governance structure our risk governance structure fosters the development and maintenance of a risk and control culture that encompasses all significant risk categories. accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit. we review our governance and committee structure on a regular basis and make changes as appropriate to continue to effectively manage and govern our risks and risk-taking.
our board of directors oversees the management of risk through its risk and capital committee (rcc) and audit committee. those committees regularly interact with other committees of the board of directors. our chief risk officer (cro) reports to both the rcc and our chief executive officer (ceo).
the group risk committee (grc):  the grc is the senior management group responsible for assessing all significant risk issues on a global basis to protect our financial strength, optimize our intrinsic value, and protect our reputation. the grc is chaired by our cro. its membership includes our ceo, chief financial officer (cfo), and other executives from across our corporate functions and business units. our cro reports periodically on behalf of the grc to both the rcc and the audit committee of the board of directors. our cro is also a member of the executive leadership team (elt) providing erm the opportunity to contribute to, review, monitor and consider the impact of changes in strategy.
management committees that support the grc are described below. these committees are comprised of senior executives and experienced business representatives from a range of functions and business units throughout aig and its subsidiaries. these committees are charged with identifying, analyzing and reviewing specific risk matters within their respective mandates.
financial risk group (frg):  the frg is responsible for the oversight of financial risks taken by aig and our subsidiaries. its mandate includes overseeing our aggregate credit, market, interest rate, capital, liquidity and model risks, as well as asset-liability management, derivatives activity, and foreign exchange transactions. it provides the primary corporate-level review function for all proposed transactions and business practices that are significant in size, complex in scope, or that present heightened legal, reputational, accounting or regulatory risks. the frg is chaired by our cro. membership of the frg also includes our cfo, chief investment officer (cio) and treasurer.
technology, operational risk & control committee (torcc): this committee oversees technology and operational risk management and control issues and activities across our businesses, functions, and geographic locations. the torcc reviews our risk management practices and monitors current and emerging technology and operational risks, as well as management actions taken to reduce risks to acceptable levels. it primarily focuses on establishing the firm-wide framework for identifying, measuring, quantifying, and managing and mitigating technology and operational risks, and monitoring our controls. the torcc addresses firm-wide, rather than business-specific issues and is mandated to prioritize technology and operational improvements that are significant and transformational. the torcc also provides a forum for senior management to assess our technology and operational risk profiles that may affect our strategic objectives.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management the scope of the torcc includes, but is not limited to, operational risk management, technology risk management, information security, compliance, sarbanes oxley, disaster recovery, project risk management and vendor risk management.
the torcc is an authorized sub-committee of our grc and supports the grc in its risk management oversight role. the torcc is co-chaired by our cio, chief operating officer, and our cro. membership of the torcc also includes owners of the control agenda, business information officers, and members of the various control functions.
in addition, the torcc may form, and delegate authority to, sub-committees or working groups which oversee technology and operational risk related matters on behalf of us with periodic reporting to the torcc.
business unit risk committees: each of our major insurance businesses has established a risk committee that serves as the senior management committee responsible for risk oversight at the individual business unit level.  the risk committees are responsible for the identification, assessment and monitoring of all sources of risk within their respective portfolios. specific responsibilities include setting risk tolerances, reviewing the capital allocation framework, insurance portfolio optimization, and providing oversight of risk-adjusted metrics. in addition, each business unit has established subordinate committees at the legal entity level and working groups in place that support these committees in executing their duties, such as ensuring policies are adhered to, and transactions are completed with risk appetite in mind. together, these committees provide comprehensive risk oversight throughout the organization.
risk appetite, limits, identification, and measurement risk appetite framework our risk appetite framework integrates stakeholder interests, strategic business goals and available financial resources. we balance these by seeking to take measured risks that are expected to generate repeatable, sustainable earnings and create long-term value for our shareholders. the framework includes our risk appetite statement approved by the board of directors or a committee thereof and a set of supporting tools, including risk tolerances, risk limits and policies, which we use to manage our risk profile and financial resources.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management organization in relation to the established risk tolerances. a consolidated risk report is also presented periodically, as required, to the rcc by our cro.
risk limits a key component of our risk appetite framework is having a process in place that establishes and maintains appropriate limits on the material risks identified for our core businesses and facilitates monitoring and meeting of both internal and external stakeholder expectations. our objectives include:
•     establishing risk monitoring, provide early warning indicators, and ensure timely oversight and enforceability of limits;
•     defining a consistent and transparent approach to limits governance; and
•     aligning our business activities with our risk appetite statement.
to support the monitoring and management of aig's and its business units' material risks, erm has an established limits framework that employs a three-tiered hierarchy:
•     board level risk tolerances are aig's aggregate capital and liquidity limits. they define the minimum level of capital and liquidity that we should maintain. these board level risk tolerances require our rcc approval.
•     aig management level limits are risk type specific limits at the aig consolidated level. these limits are defined and calibrated to constrain our concentration in specific risk types, and to protect against taking risks that exceed the amount of overall capital aig has available. these limits are approved by our cro with consultation from the grc.
•     bu level limits are set to address key risks identified by erm for the business unit/module and/or meet business unit/module specific requirements by regulators and rating agencies. these limits are defined by the business unit risk officers.
all limits are reviewed by the frg, grc or relevant business unit risk committees on a periodic basis and revisions, if applicable, are approved by those committees.
the business units are responsible for measuring and monitoring their risk exposures. erm is responsible for monitoring compliance with limits and providing regular, timely reporting to our senior management and risk committees. limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner and are documented and escalated in accordance with their level of severity or materiality.
risk identification and measurement one tool we use to inform our risk appetite framework is risk identification.  we conduct risk identification through a number of processes at the business unit and corporate level focused on capturing our material risks and key areas of focus for follow-up risk management actions. a key initiative is our integrated bottom-up risk identification and assessment process down to the product-line level. these processes are used as a critical input to enhance and develop our analytics for measuring and assessing risks across the organization.
we employ various approaches to measure, monitor, and manage risk exposures, including the utilization of a variety of metrics and early warning indicators. we use a proprietary stress testing framework to measure our quantifiable risks. this framework is built on our existing erm stress testing methodology for both insurance and non-insurance operations.
the framework measures risk over multiple time horizons and under different levels of stress. we develop a range of stress scenarios based both on internal experience and regulatory guidance. the stress tests are intended to ensure that sufficient resources are available under both idiosyncratic and systemic market stress conditions.
the stress testing framework assesses our aggregate exposure to our most significant financial and insurance risks, including the risk in each of our key insurance company subsidiaries in relation to its capital needs under stress, risks inherent in our non-insurance company subsidiaries, and risks to aig consolidated capital. we use this information to determine the resources needed at the aig parent level to support our subsidiaries and capital resources required to maintain consolidated company target capitalization levels.
credit risk management     liquidity risk management     insurance risks
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management credit risk management overview credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty's credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads.
we devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. these exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees and letters of credit.
governance our credit risks are managed by a team of investment professionals, subject to erm oversight and various control processes. erm is assisted by credit functions headed by highly experienced credit professionals. their primary role is to assure appropriate credit risk management in accordance with our credit policies and procedures relative to our credit risk parameters. our chief credit officer (cco) and credit executives are primarily responsible for the development, implementation and maintenance of a risk management framework, which includes the following elements related to our credit risks:
•     developing and implementing our company-wide credit policies and procedures;
•     approving delegated credit authorities to our credit executives and qualified investment professionals;
•     developing methodologies for quantification and assessment of credit risks, including the establishment and maintenance of our internal risk rating process;
•     managing a system of credit and program limits, as well as the approval process for credit transactions, above limit exposures, and concentrations of risk that may exist or be incurred;
•     evaluating, monitoring, reviewing and reporting of credit risks and concentrations regularly with senior management; and
•     approving appropriate credit reserves, credit-related other-than-temporary impairments and corresponding methodologies for all credit portfolios.
we monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. to minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third‐party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. we treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, and letters of credit as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. we also monitor closely the quality of any trust collateral accounts.
see investments - available for sale investments herein for further information on our credit concentrations and credit exposures.
market risk management market risk is defined as the risk of adverse impact due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers:  equity and commodity prices, residential and commercial real estate values, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange, inflation, and their levels of volatility.
we are engaged in a variety of insurance, investment and other financial services businesses that generate market risk, directly and indirectly. we are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on and off-balance sheet exposures. the chief risk officer within each business is responsible for creating a framework to properly identify these risks, then ensuring that they are appropriately measured, monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the chief market risk officer (cmro).
the scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our risk appetite statement. our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in these broad market observables, as opposed to from the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management risk identification market risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad, external, predominantly market observable risks. financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital.
equity prices.  we are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments. changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly-traded equity shares, investments in private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other equity-linked capital market instruments as well as equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance.
residential and commercial real estate values.  our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments. changes in residential/commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential/commercial mortgages, residential/commercial mortgage‐backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential/commercial mortgages, trusts that include residential/commercial real estate and/or mortgages, residential mortgage insurance contracts and commercial real estate investments.
interest rates.  interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and make certain of our product offerings less attractive to investors. conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. however, when rates rise quickly, there can be a temporary asymmetric gaap accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value, which is largely reported in other comprehensive income, and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized. changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, financial liabilities, insurance contracts including but not limited to fixed rate annuities, variable annuities and derivative contracts.
credit spreads.  credit spreads measure an instrument's risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default‐free instrument. changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including but not limited to corporate bonds, abs, mortgage-backed securities, aig-issued debt obligations, credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments. much like higher interest rates, wider credit spreads with unchanged default losses mean more investment income in the long‐term. in the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities, which is largely reported in other comprehensive income. a precipitous widening of credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit‐worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses.
foreign exchange (fx) rates.  we are a globally diversified enterprise with income, assets and liabilities denominated in, and capital deployed in, a variety of currencies. changes in fx rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions.
commodity prices.  changes in commodity prices (the value of commodities) can affect the valuation of publicly‐traded commodities, commodity indices and derivatives on commodities and commodity indices. we are exposed to commodity prices primarily through their impact on the prices and credit quality of commodity producers' debt and equity securities in our investment portfolio.
inflation.  changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including aig-issued debt obligations, derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices, and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly, via indexing, or implicitly, through medical costs or wage levels.
governance market risk is overseen at the corporate level within erm through the cmro, who reports directly to the aig cro.  the cmro is supported by a dedicated team of professionals within erm. market risk is managed by our finance, treasury and investment management corporate functions, collectively, and in partnership with erm. the cmro is primarily responsible for the development and maintenance of a risk management framework that includes the following key components:
•     written policies that define the rules for our market risk-taking activities and provide clear guidance regarding their execution and management;
•     a limit framework that aligns with our board-approved risk appetite statement;
•     independent measurement, monitoring and reporting for line of business, business unit and enterprise-wide market risks; and
•     clearly defined authorities for all individuals and committee roles and responsibilities related to market risk management.
•     these components facilitate the cmro's identification, measurement, monitoring, reporting and management of our market risks.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management risk measurement our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures. at the firm‐wide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with aig's risk appetite statement. this is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework. our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels. at the market risk level, the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis.
in addition, we continue to use enhanced economic, gaap accounting and statutory capital‐based risk measures at the market risk level, business‐unit level and firm‐wide levels. this process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures.
sensitivity analysis. sensitivity analysis measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input. examples of such sensitivities include a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities, a one basis point increase in credit spreads of fixed maturity securities, and a one percent increase in prices of equity securities.
scenario analysis uses historical, hypothetical, or forward‐looking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures. examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world‐wide equity markets. scenarios may also utilize a stochastic framework to arrive at a probability distribution of losses.

(a)  at december 31, 2016, the analysis covered $276.9 billion of $292.5 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. excluded were $8.1 billion of loans and $2.5 billion of investments in life settlements. in addition, $5.0 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations. at december 31, 2015, the analysis covered $279.6 billion of $298.7 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. excluded were $10.7 billion of loans and $3.6 billion of investments in life settlements. in addition, $4.8 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations.
(b)  the majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag.
foreign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated non‐u.s. dollar assets less our consolidated non‐u.s dollar liabilities on a gaap basis, with certain adjustments. we use a bottom-up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level. at the aig parent level, we monitor our single foreign currency exposures and limit the risk of the aggregate currency portfolio.
our foreign currency-denominated net asset position at december 31, 2016, decreased by $830 million compared to december 31, 2015. the decrease was mostly due to a $1.6 billion decrease in our hong kong dollar position, primarily resulting from the sale of our property casualty insurance companies' picc investment, partially offset by a $600 million increase in our japanese yen position primarily due to hedging activities, unrealized appreciation, and strengthening of the yen against the u.s. dollar.
for illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the u.s. dollar. the estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management the sensitivity factors utilized for 2016 and presented above were selected based on historical data from 1996 to 2016, as follows (see the table below):
•     a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve is consistent with a one standard deviation movement of the benchmark ten-year treasury yield;
•     a 20 percent drop for equity and alternative investments is broadly consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the s&p 500; and
•     a 10 percent depreciation of foreign currency exchange rates is consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the u.s. dollar (usd)/japanese yen (jpy) exchange rate.
risk monitoring and limits the risk monitoring responsibilities, owned by the business units, include ensuring compliance with market risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. such activities must be reported to the erm market risk team by the relevant business unit. this monitoring approach is aligned with our overall risk limits framework.
to control our exposure to market risk, we rely on a three-tiered hierarchy of limits that the cmro closely monitors and reports to our cro, senior management and risk committees.
see risk appetite, limits, identification, and measurement - risk limits herein for further information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits.
liquidity risk management liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations. failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency, reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, reputational harm and regulatory action.
aig and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity during both the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash will be available to meet the obligations as they come due.
aig parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are designed to allow it to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six- months under a liquidity stress scenario. we maintain liquidity limits and minimum coverage ratios designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions. if we project that we will breach these tolerances, we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions. however, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements.
risk identification the following sources of liquidity and funding risks could impact our ability to meet short-term financial obligations as they come due.
•     market/monetization risk: assets may not be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions. market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs.
•     cash flow mismatch risk: discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short-term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls.
•     event funding risk: additional funding may be required as the result of a trigger event. event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings, a market event, or some other event that creates a funding obligation or limits existing funding options.
•     financing risk: we may be unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions, aig-specific issues, or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management governance liquidity risk is overseen at the corporate level within erm.  the aig cro has responsibility for the oversight of the liquidity risk management framework and delegates the day-to-day implementation of this framework to the aig treasurer. our corporate treasury function manages liquidity risk, subject to erm oversight and various control processes.
the liquidity risk management framework is guided by the liquidity risk tolerance as set forth in the board-approved risk appetite statement. the principal objective of this framework is to establish minimum liquidity requirements that protect our long-term viability and ability to fund our ongoing business, and to meet short-term financial obligations in a timely manner in both normal and stressed conditions.
our liquidity risk management framework includes a number of liquidity and funding policies and monitoring tools to address aig-specific, broader industry and market related liquidity events.
risk measurement comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk. we produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows. in addition, we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity.
we use a number of approaches to measure our liquidity risk exposure, including:
minimum liquidity limits: minimum liquidity limits specify the amount of assets required to be maintained in specific liquidity portfolios to meet obligations as they arise over a specified time horizon under stressed liquidity conditions.
coverage ratios: coverage ratios measure the adequacy of available liquidity sources, including the ability to monetize assets to meet the forecasted cash flows over a specified time horizon. the portfolio of assets is selected based on our ability to convert those assets into cash under the assumed market conditions and within the specified time horizon.
cash flow forecasts: cash flow forecasts measure the liquidity needed for a specific legal entity over a specified time horizon.
stress testing: asset liquidity and coverage ratios are re-measured under defined liquidity stress scenarios that will impact net cash flows, liquid assets and/or other funding sources.
relevant liquidity reporting is produced and reported regularly to aig parent and business unit risk committees. the frequency, content, and nature of reporting will vary for each business unit and legal entity, based on its complexity, risk profile, activities and size.
operational risk is inherent in each of our business units. operational risks can have many impacts, including but not limited to: unexpected economic losses or gains, reputational harm due to negative publicity, regulatory action from supervisory agencies, operational and business disruptions, and/or damage to customer relationships.
orm oversees the operational risk policy and framework, which includes risk identification, assessment, prioritization, measurement, monitoring, and reporting of operational risk. as part of the framework, we deploy a series of operational risk programs to support our business units with the identification, monitoring and reporting of operational risks. the orm programs include, but are not limited to, several key components as outlined below:
•     the risk event capture process enables each employee to identify, document, and escalate operational risk impacts, with a view to enhancing, processes and promoting lessons learned.
•     the vulnerability identification (vid) process identifies emerging risks, which we consider to be risks that have not yet fully manifested themselves but could become significant over time.
•     the ordinal risk ranking effort provides an ordinal ranking of aig's most significant operational risks at the enterprise, segment or regional levels, with the goal of prioritizing assessment and remediation activity.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management
•     the risk and control self-assessments (rcsas) allow for the identification and assessment of the key operational risks within our respective business units and a determination as to whether the related controls are effective.
orm, working together with other second lines of defense functions (e.g., model validation and the technology risk office, as well as compliance, sarbanes oxley, and global business continuity), provides an independent view of operational risk for each business, and works with the business to facilitate implementation of the above programs.  this includes coverage of operational risks related to core insurance activities, investing, model risk, technology (including cyber security, access, data privacy and data security), third-party providers, as well as compliance and regulatory matters. based on the results of the risk identification and assessment efforts above, business leaders are accountable for tracking and remediating identified issues in line with our risk monitoring procedures. governance committees support these efforts and promote transparency and management decision making.
an integrated risk and control framework facilitates the identification and mitigation of operational risk issues. to accomplish this, our integrated risk and control framework is designed to:
ensure first line accountability and ownership of risks and controls;
promote role clarity among the business and risk and control functions;
pro-actively address potential risk issues and assign clear ownership and accountability for addressing identified risk issues; and
insurance risks except as described above, we manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. a primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. to achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.
we operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. we manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of procedures:
•     underwriting approval processes and authorities;
•     exposure limits with ongoing monitoring;
•     management of relationship between assets and liabilities, including hedging;
•     modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels (policy, line of business, product group, country, individual/group, correlation and catastrophic risk events);
•     compliance with financial reporting and capital and solvency targets;
•     review and challenge of reserves to ensure comprehensive analysis with established escalation procedures to provide appropriate transparency in reserving decisions and judgments made in the establishment of reserves.
we closely manage insurance risk by monitoring and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each line of business underwritten, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums we charge for taking on the risk. we analyze concentrations of risk using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.
•     property casualty insurance companies - risks covered include property, casualty, fidelity/surety, accident and health, aviation, and management liability. we manage risks in the general insurance business through aggregations and limitations of concentrations at multiple levels: policy, line of business, geography, industry and legal entity.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management
•     life insurance companies - risks include mortality and morbidity in the insurance-oriented products and insufficient cash flows to cover contract liabilities and longevity risk in the retirement savings-oriented products. we manage risks through product design, sound medical and non-medical underwriting, and external reinsurance programs.
we purchase reinsurance for our insurance operations. reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. we may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis. pooling of our reinsurance risks enables us to purchase reinsurance more efficiently at a consolidated level, manage global counterparty risk and relationships and manage global catastrophe risks.
governance insurance risks are monitored at the business unit level within erm and overseen by the business unit chief risk officer, who reports directly to our cro. the framework includes the following key components:
•     written policies that define the rules for our insurance risk-taking activities;
•     a limit framework focused on key insurance risks that aligns with our board-approved risk appetite statement; and
•     clearly defined authorities for all individuals and committee roles and responsibilities related to insurance risk management.
risk measurement, monitoring and limits we use a number of approaches to measure our insurance risk exposure, including:
stochastic methods. stochastic methods are used to measure and monitor risks including natural catastrophe, reserve and premium risk. we develop probabilistic estimates of risk based on our exposures, historical observed volatility or industry-recognized models in the case of catastrophe risk.
scenario analysis. scenario or deterministic analysis is used to measure and monitor risks such as terrorism or to estimate losses due to man-made catastrophic scenarios.
in addition, we monitor concentrations of exposure through insurance limits aggregated along dimensions such as geography, industry, or counterparty.
the risk monitoring responsibilities of the business units include ensuring compliance with insurance risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. such activities are reported to management by the relevant business unit for informative decision-making on a regular basis. this monitoring approach is aligned with our overall risk limits framework.
risk limits have a consistent framework used across aig, its business units, and legal entities. this includes escalation thresholds in cases where measurement is particularly challenging.
see risk appetite, limits, identification, and measurement - risk limits herein for further information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits property casualty insurance companies key insurance risks we manage insurance risks through risk review and selection processes, exposure limitations, exclusions, deductibles, self-insured retentions, coverage limits, attachment points, and reinsurance. this management is supported by sound underwriting practices, pricing procedures and the use of actuarial analysis to help determine overall adequacy of provisions for insurance. underwriting practices and pricing procedures incorporate historical experience, changes in underlying exposure, current regulation and judicial decisions as well as proposed or anticipated regulatory changes.
•     loss reserves - the potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the property casualty insurance companies. there is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. we manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. see item 7. md&a - critical accounting estimates - insurance liabilities - loss reserves herein for further information.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management
•     underwriting - the potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the property casualty insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. we develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. this may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, worse than expected prepayment of policies, investment results, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.
•     single risk loss exposure - our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. the net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by our grc through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.
•     reinsurance - since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers either due to an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event, or that actual reinsurance coverage is different than anticipated. the inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.
natural catastrophe risk we manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate probable maximum loss (pml) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.
we use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. we apply a proprietary multi-model approach to account for relative strengths and weaknesses of vendor models, and make adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.
we perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model weaknesses, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. the majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.
we recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. with multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policy to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. for example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. in addition, we are committed to providing innovative insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change, including expanding natural disaster resilience, promoting adaptation, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. our internal product development, underwriting, modeling, and sustainability practices will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.
our natural catastrophe exposure is primarily driven by the u.s. and japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries. for example, we have exposures to additional perils such as european windstorms and floods and seismic events across the pacific rim. within the u.s., we have significant hurricane exposure in florida, the gulf of mexico, northeast u.s. and mid-atlantic regions. events impacting the northeast u.s. and the mid-atlantic may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in those regions. within the u.s., we have significant earthquake exposure in california, the pacific northwest and new madrid regions. earthquakes impacting the pacific northwest and new madrid regions may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions.
the estimates below are the occurrence exceedance probability (oep) losses, which reflect losses that may occur in any single event due to the defined peril. the 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 pmls are the probable maximum losses from a single natural catastrophe event with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management the following table presents an overview of oep modeled losses for top perils and countries:
(in                              gross         reinsurance         reinsurance, after tax   shareholder equity millions)
aig, along with other property casualty insurance and reinsurance companies, uses industry-recognized catastrophe models and applies proprietary modeling processes and assumptions to arrive at loss estimates. the use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses. since there is no industry standard for assumptions and preparation of insured data for use in these models, our modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies.
also, the modeled results are based on the assumption that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to us under the terms of the reinsurance arrangements and all catastrophe bonds attach and pay as modeled. however, reinsurance recoverable may not be fully collectible. in particular, the use of catastrophe bonds may not provide commensurate levels of protection compared to traditional reinsurance transactions. therefore, these estimates are inherently uncertain and may not accurately reflect our exposure to these events.
our 2017 catastrophe reinsurance program includes coverage for natural catastrophes and some coverage for terrorism events. it consists of a large north american occurrence cover (without reinstatement) to protect against large north america losses, and japan covers to protect against losses in japan. the attachment point for this reinsurance program is at $1.5 billion for the north american cover ($3 billion in 2016) and varies for the japan covers. the north american cover has reduced the u.s. hurricane (1-in-100) oep net of reinsurance from $3.1 billion under the 2016 reinsurance program to $2.0 billion under the 2017 program.
actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios. the occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. see also item 1a. risk factors - reserves and exposures for additional information.
terrorism risk we actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. we have set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios. terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model and various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the property casualty insurance companies exposures. examples of modeled scenarios are conventional bombs of different sizes, anthrax attacks and nuclear attacks.
our largest terrorism exposures are in new york city, and estimated losses are largely driven by the property and workers' compensation lines of business. at our largest exposure location, modeled losses for a five-ton bomb attack net of the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act (tripra) and reinsurance recoveries are estimated to be $2.8 billion as of september 30, 2016.
our exposure to terrorism risk in the u.s. is mitigated by tripra in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. tripra covers terrorist attacks within the united states or u.s. missions and against certain u.s. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law. in 2017, tripra covers 83 percent of insured losses above a deductible, decreasing by one percent each year to 80 percent in 2020. the current estimate of our deductible is approximately $2.5 billion for 2016.
we offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. international terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. we also rely on the government sponsored and government arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-u.s. jurisdictions.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management reinsurance activities reinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events such as natural and man-made catastrophes. our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. in addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.
•     traditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the united states, bermuda, london and europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;
•     capital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar vehicles; and
we continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives.
reinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. however, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.
in certain markets, we are required to participate on a proportional basis in reinsurance pools based on our relative share of direct writings in those markets. such mandatory reinsurance generally covers higher-risk consumer exposures such as assigned-risk automobile and earthquake, as well as certain commercial exposures such as workers' compensation.
at december 31, 2016, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $21.9 billion. these assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $1.1 billion, ceded loss reserves of $15.7 billion including reserves for ibnr, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $3.4 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverables of $1.7 billion. the methods used to estimate ibnr and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. these methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. any adjustments are reflected in income. we believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at december 31, 2016 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. actual losses may, however, differ, perhaps materially, from the reserves currently ceded.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management maximum potential exposure from unexpected loss events that could be ceded to a reinsurer. in addition, credit executives within erm review reinsurer exposures and credit limits and approve reinsurer credit limits above specified levels. finally, even where we conclude that uncollateralized credit risk is acceptable, we require collateral from active reinsurance counterparties where it is necessary for our subsidiaries to recognize the reinsurance recoverable assets for statutory accounting purposes. at december 31, 2016, we held $8.1 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or evergreen letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers. we believe that no exposure to a single reinsurer represents an inappropriate concentration of risk to us.
(d)  includes $1.8 billion recoverable under the 2011 retroactive reinsurance transaction pursuant to which a large portion of the property casualty insurance companies net domestic asbestos liabilities were transferred to nico. does not include reinsurance assets ceded to other reinsurers for which nico has assumed the collection risk. we entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with nico, discussed in item 7. md&a - insurance reserves - reinsurance activities. based on reserves as of december 31, 2016, this agreement will increase the gross reinsurance assets and collateral held from the berkshire hathaway group of companies by approximately $12.8 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively.
at december 31, 2016, we had no significant general reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. reinsurer capital levels remained stable in 2016, and the industry's robust underwriting capacity resulted in continued competition and attractive rates for 2017 renewals. reduced profitability associated with lower rates could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. the rcd, in conjunction with the credit executives within erm, reviews these developments, monitors credit triggers that may require the reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.
see item 7. md&a - critical accounting estimates - reinsurance assets for further discussion of reinsurance recoverable.
life insurance companies key insurance risks our individual retirement, group retirement, life insurance and institutional markets businesses manage risk through product design, experience monitoring, pricing actions, risk limitations, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the relationships between assets and liabilities, including hedging.
•     mortality risk - represents the risk of loss arising from actual mortality rates being higher than expected mortality rates.  this risk could arise from pandemics or other events, including longer-term societal changes that cause higher than expected mortality. this risk exists in a number of our product lines, but is most significant for our life insurance products.
•     longevity risk - represents the risk of a change in value of a policy or benefit as a result of actual mortality rates being lower than the expected mortality rates. this risk could arise from longer-term societal health changes as well as other factors. this risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our retirement, institutional and annuity products.
•     policyholder behavior risk including surrender/lapse risk - represents the risk that actual policyholder behavior differs from expected behavior in a manner that has an adverse effect on our results of operations. there are many assumptions made when products are sold, including how long the contracts will persist. actual experience can vary significantly from these assumptions.  this risk is impacted by a number of factors including changes in market conditions, especially interest rate and equity market changes, tax law, regulations and policyholder preferences. this risk exists in the majority of our product lines.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management can also manifest itself over a longer period of time, such as in a persistent low interest rate environment. low long-term interest rates put pressure on investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce, or eliminate future profits on certain existing fixed rate products.
•     equity risk - represents the potential for loss due to changes in equity prices. it affects equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities (and associated guaranteed living and death benefits, as discussed below), universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance. in addition, changes in the volatility of equity prices can affect the valuation of insurance features that are accounted for as embedded derivatives and the related economic hedges.
the emergence of significant adverse experience compared to the initial assumptions at policy issuance or updated assumption would require an adjustment to dac and benefit reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for a particular period. for additional discussion of the impact of actual and expected experience on dac and benefit reserves, see critical accounting estimates - future policy benefits for life and accident and health (life insurance companies) and critical accounting estimates - guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity products (life insurance companies). for additional discussion of business risks, see item 1a. risk factors - business and operations.
variable annuity risk management and hedging programs our individual and group retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with gmwb riders that guarantee a certain level of benefits. gmwb guaranteed living benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in other realized capital gains (losses). gmwb features subject the life insurance companies to market risk, including exposure to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility.
variable annuity product design is the first step in managing our exposure to these market risks. risk mitigation features of our variable annuity product design include gmwb rider fees indexed to an equity market volatility index, which can provide additional fee assessments in periods of increased market volatility, required minimum allocations to fixed accounts to reduce overall equity exposure, and the utilization of volatility control funds, which reduce equity exposure in the funds in response to changes in market volatility, even under sudden or extreme market movements.
after reflecting our product risk-mitigating features, we hedge our remaining economic exposure to market risk within gmwb features through our variable annuity hedging program, which is designed to offset certain changes in the economic value of these gmwb embedded derivatives, within established thresholds. the hedging program is designed to provide additional protection against large and combined movements in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility under multiple scenarios.
our hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents our estimate of the underlying economic risks in our gmwb riders, based on the present value of the future expected benefit payments for the gmwb, less the present value of future rider fees, over numerous stochastic scenarios.  this stochastic projection method uses best estimate assumptions for policyholder behavior (including mortality, lapses, withdrawals and benefit utilization) in conjunction with market scenarios calibrated to observable equity and interest rate option prices. policyholder behaviors are regularly evaluated to compare current assumptions to actual experience and, if appropriate, changes are made to the policyholder behavior assumptions. the risk of changes in policyholder behavior is not explicitly hedged and such differences between expected and actual policyholder behaviors may result in hedge ineffectiveness.
due to differences between the calculation of the economic hedge target and u.s. gaap valuation of the embedded derivative, which include differences in the treatment of rider fees and exclusion of certain risk margins and other differences in discount rates, we expect relative movements in the economic hedge target and the u.s. gaap embedded derivative valuation will vary over time with changes in equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads.  see insurance reserves - life and annuity reserves and dac - variable annuity guaranteed benefits and hedging results for information on the impact on our consolidated pre-tax income from the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives and the hedging portfolio, as well as additional discussion of differences between the economic hedge target and the valuation of the embedded derivatives.
in designing our hedging portfolio for our variable annuity hedging program, we make assumptions and projections about the future performance of the underlying contract holder funds. to project future account value changes, we make assumptions about how each of the underlying funds will perform. we map the contract holder funds to a set of publicly traded indices that we believe best represent the liability to be hedged. basis risk exists due to the variance between these assumptions and actual fund returns, which may result in variances between changes in the hedging portfolio and changes in the economic hedge target. net hedge results and the cost of hedging are also impacted by differences between realized volatility and implied volatility.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management options and futures contracts.  similarly as with the variable annuities, there are differences between the calculation of the economic hedge target and u.s. gaap valuation of the index annuity and index life embedded derivatives, which can lead to variances in their relative movements.
to manage the capital market exposures embedded within the economic hedge target, we identify and hedge market sensitivities to changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility and for variable annuities, credit spreads.  each hedge program purchases derivative instruments or securities having sensitivities that offset those in the economic hedge target, within internally defined threshold levels.  since the relative movements of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target vary over time or with market changes, the net exposure can be outside the threshold limits, and adjustments to the hedging portfolio are made periodically to return the net exposure to within threshold limits.
our hedging programs utilize various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaption contracts, as well as other hedging instruments.  in addition, for variable annuities, we purchase certain fixed income securities and elect the fair value option as a capital efficient way to manage interest rate and credit spread exposures.  to minimize counterparty credit risk, the majority of our derivative instrument hedges are implemented using exchange-traded futures and options, cleared through global exchanges. over the counter derivatives are highly collateralized.
the hedging programs are monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the economic hedge target and derivative portfolio are within the threshold limits, pursuant to the approved hedge strategy.  daily risk monitoring verifies that the net risk exposures, as measured through sensitivities to a large set of market shocks, are within the approved net risk exposure threshold limits.  in addition, monthly stress tests are performed to determine the program's effectiveness relative to the applicable limits, under an array of combined severe market stresses in equity prices, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads.  finally, hedge strategies are reviewed regularly to gauge their effectiveness in managing our market exposures in the context of our overall risk appetite.
other business risks derivative transactions we utilize derivatives principally to enable us to hedge exposure to interest rates, currencies, credit, commodities, equities and other risks. credit risk associated with derivative counterparties exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to us. the maximum potential exposure will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions.  all derivative transactions must be transacted within counterparty limits that have been approved by erm.
we evaluate counterparty credit quality by internal analysis consistent with the aig credit policy.  we utilize various credit enhancements, including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit derivatives, margin agreements and subordination to reduce the credit risk relating to outstanding financial derivative transactions. we require credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties, and transaction size and maturity. furthermore, we enter into certain agreements that have the benefit of set-off and close-out netting provisions, such as isda master agreements. these provisions provide that, in the case of an early termination of a transaction, we can set off receivables from a counterparty against payables to the same counterparty arising out of all covered transactions. as a result, where a legally enforceable netting agreement exists, the fair value of the transaction with the counterparty represents the net sum of estimated fair values.
the fair value of our interest rate, currency, credit, commodity and equity swaps, options, swaptions, and forward commitments, futures, and forward contracts reported as a component of other assets, was approximately $1.8 billion at december 31, 2016 and $1.3 billion at december 31, 2015. where applicable, these amounts have been determined in accordance with the respective master netting agreements.

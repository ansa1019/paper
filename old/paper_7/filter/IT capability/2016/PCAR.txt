item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
paccar is a global technology company whose truck segment includes the design and manufacture of high-quality light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial trucks. in north america, trucks are sold under the kenworth and peterbilt nameplates, in europe, under the daf nameplate and in australia and south america, under the kenworth and daf nameplates. the parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles. the companys financial services segment derives its earnings primarily from financing or leasing paccar products in north america, europe and australia. the companys other business includes the manufacturing and marketing of industrial winches.
 in 2016, paccar earned net income for the 78th consecutive year. net income was $521.7 million ($1.48 per diluted share) in 2016. on july 19, 2016, the european commission (ec) concluded its investigation of all major european truck manufacturers and reached a settlement with daf. excluding the $833.0 million non-recurring, non-tax-deductible ec charge recorded in the first half of 2016, the company earned adjusted net income (non-gaap) of $1.35 billion ($3.85 per diluted share) in 2016 compared to net income of $1.60 billion ($4.51 per diluted share) in 2015. the operating results reflect lower truck and parts sales in the u.s., partially offset by increased truck sales in europe. see reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap financial measures on page 33.
 capital investments were $402.7 million in 2016 compared to $308.4 million in 2015, reflecting additional investments for the construction of a new daf cab paint facility in europe, the peterbilt plant expansion in denton, texas and a new parts distribution center (pdc) in renton, washington.
 after-tax return on beginning equity (roe) was 7.5%. excluding the ec charge, adjusted roe (non-gaap) was 19.5%. see reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap financial measures on page 33.
in april 2016, the company opened its new 160,000 square-foot pdc in renton, washington. the new pdc provides enhanced aftermarket support for dealers and customers in the pacific northwest and western canada. in addition, the company will begin construction of a new 160,000 square-foot distribution center in toronto, canada in 2017.
the company launched its daf connect telematics system in europe, which provides customers with fleet management data to enhance vehicle and driver performance. customers can access information through a secure online service, enabling them to optimize vehicle utilization and uptime, reduce operational expenses and enhance logistical efficiency.
peterbilt constructed a 102,000 square-foot expansion to its truck manufacturing facility in denton, texas. the expansion is peterbilts largest facility investment since the construction of the denton plant in 1980 and will enhance manufacturing efficiency and provide additional production capacity.
the company launched a new proprietary tandem axle in north america that reduces vehicle weight by up to 150 pounds and improves fuel economy. the axle became available to customers in january 2017. in addition, the company is enhancing its range of mx engines for 2017. the updated paccar engines will deliver increased power and fuel efficiency and reduce operating costs for customers.
paccar australia launched the kenworth t610 truck in the fourth quarter of 2016. the kenworth t610 represents the largest production investment in paccar australias 45-year history. the t610 was designed specifically for australias demanding road transport market and delivers industry-leading durability, reliability and fuel efficiency. the new 2.1 meter-wide cab features more driver space, enhanced visibility and excellent ergonomics.
daf is constructing a new $110 million environmentally friendly, robotic cab paint facility at its factory in westerlo, belgium, which will increase capacity and efficiency, and minimize emissions and energy consumption. the facility is expected to open in mid-2017. this strategic investment will support dafs market share growth and reflects dafs leadership in producing high quality vehicles.
paccar financial services (pfs) has operations covering four continents and 23 countries. pfs, with its global breadth and its rigorous credit application process, supports a portfolio of loans and leases with total assets of $12.19 billion that earned pre-tax profit of $306.5 million. pfs issued $1.94 billion in medium term notes during 2016 to support portfolio growth and repay maturing debt.
truck outlook truck industry retail sales in the u.s. and canada in 2017 are expected to be 190,000 to 220,000 units compared to 215,700 in 2016. in europe, the 2017 truck industry registrations for over 16-tonne vehicles are expected to be 260,000 to 290,000 units compared to 302,500 in 2016. in south america, heavy-duty truck industry sales were 59,000 units in 2016 and in 2017 are estimated to be in a range of 60,000 to 70,000 units.
financial services outlook based on the truck market outlook, average earning assets in 2017 are expected to be comparable to 2016. current good levels of freight tonnage, freight rates and fleet utilization are contributing to customers profitability and cash flow. if current freight transportation conditions decline due to weaker economic conditions, then past due accounts, truck repossessions and credit losses would likely increase from the current low levels and new business volume would likely decline.
capital spending and r&d outlook capital investments in 2017 are expected to be $375 to $425 million, and r&d is expected to be $250 to $280 million. the company is investing for future growth in paccars integrated powertrain, advanced driver assistance and truck connectivity technologies, and additional capacity and operating efficiency of the companys manufacturing and parts distribution facilities. dafs new $110 million cab paint facility is on schedule to open in mid-2017.
the following provides an analysis of the results of operations for the companys three reportable segments - truck, parts and financial services. where possible, the company has quantified the impact of factors identified in the following discussion and analysis. in cases where it is not possible to quantify the impact of factors, the company lists them in estimated order of importance. factors for which the company is unable to specifically quantify the impact include market demand, fuel prices, freight tonnage and economic conditions affecting the companys results of operations.
total units                                          140,900           154,700            (9   )
in 2016, industry retail sales in the heavy-duty market in the u.s. and canada decreased to 215,700 units from 278,400 units in 2015. the companys heavy-duty truck retail market share increased to 28.5% in 2016 from 27.4% in 2015. the medium-duty market was 85,200 units in 2016 compared to 80,200 units in 2015. the companys medium-duty market share was 16.2% in 2016 compared to 17.0% in 2015.
the over 16-tonne truck market in europe in 2016 increased to 302,500 units from 269,100 units in 2015, and dafs market share increased to 15.5% in 2016 from 14.6% in 2015. the 6 to 16-tonne market in 2016 increased to 52,900 units from 49,000 units in 2015. daf market share in the 6 to 16-tonne market in 2016 increased to 10.1% from 9.0% in 2015.
the companys worldwide truck net sales and revenues decreased to $12.77 billion in 2016 from $14.78 billion in 2015, primarily due to lower truck deliveries in the u.s. and canada, partially offset by higher truck deliveries in europe. truck segment income before income taxes and pre-tax return on revenues decreased in 2016, reflecting the lower truck unit deliveries and lower margins. the major factors for the changes in net sales and revenues, cost of sales and revenues and gross margin between 2016 and 2015 for the truck segment are as follows:
$87.4 million due to higher average asset balances.  the currency translation effect on sales and cost of sales reflects a decline in the value of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, primarily the british pound and the canadian dollar. 
 the currency translation effect on sales and cost of sales reflects a decline in the value of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, primarily the british pound.
new loan and lease unit volume:
 average debt balances decreased $9.0 million (excluding foreign exchange effects) in 2016. the lower average debt balances reflect lower funding requirements as the higher average earning asset portfolio (which includes loans, finance leases, wholesale and equipment on operating lease) was funded with retained equity.  lower portfolio yields (4.91% in 2016 compared to 4.92% in 2015) decreased interest and fees by $1.0 million. the lower portfolio yields reflect higher lending volumes in europe at lower relative market rates.  higher borrowing rates (1.5% in 2016 compared to 1.4% in 2015) were primarily due to higher debt market rates in north america, partially offset by lower debt market rates in europe. 
 results on returned lease assets increased depreciation and other expenses by $19.2 million, primarily due to gains on sales of returned lease units in 2015 versus losses in 2016.
 the currency translation effects reflect a decline in the value of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, primarily the mexican peso and british pound.
the company modifies loans and finance leases as a normal part of its financial services operations. the company may modify loans and finance leases for commercial reasons or for credit reasons. modifications for commercial reasons are changes to contract terms for customers that are not considered to be in financial difficulty. insignificant delays are modifications extending terms up to three months for customers experiencing some short-term financial stress, but not considered to be in financial difficulty. modifications for credit reasons are changes to contract terms for customers considered to be in financial difficulty. the companys modifications typically result in granting more time to pay the contractual amounts owed and charging a fee and interest for the term of the modification. when considering whether to modify customer accounts for credit reasons, the company evaluates the creditworthiness of the customers and modifies those accounts that the company considers likely to perform under the modified terms. when the company modifies loans and finance leases for credit reasons and grants a concession, the modifications are classified as troubled debt restructurings (tdr).

in 2016, total modification activity increased compared to 2015, primarily reflecting higher volume of refinancings for commercial reasons, including a contract modification for one large customer in the u.s. the increase in modifications for insignificant delay reflects more fleet customers requesting payment relief for up to three months. credit  no concession modifications increased primarily due to extensions granted to one customer in australia.
modifications of accounts in prior quarters that were more than 30 days past due at the time of modification are included in past dues if they were not performing under the modified terms at december 31, 2016 and 2015. the effect on the allowance for credit losses from such modifications was not significant at december 31, 2016 and 2015.
income taxes in 2016, the effective tax rate increased to 53.8% from 31.4% in 2015, and substantially all of the difference in tax rates was due to the non-deductible expense of $833.0 million for the ec charge in 2016. based on existing tax laws, with the exception of 2016, the company believes that its historical effective tax rates will be indicative of the companys future tax rates.

units in 2014. daf market share was 9.0% in 2015, an increase from 8.9% in 2014. the companys worldwide truck net sales and revenue are summarized below:
truck segment income before income taxes and pre-tax return on revenues reflect higher truck unit deliveries and improved gross margins in the u.s. and europe. the effects on income before income taxes of translating weaker foreign currencies to the u.s. dollar, primarily the euro, were largely offset by lower costs of north american mx engine components imported from europe. the major factors for the changes in net sales and revenues, cost of sales and revenues and gross margin between 2015 and 2014 for the truck segment are as follows:
 average truck sales prices increased sales by $78.2 million, primarily due to improved price realization in europe.  average cost per truck decreased cost of sales by $107.7 million, primarily due to lower material costs, reflecting lower commodity prices and lower costs of north american mx engine components imported from europe which benefited from the decline in the value of the euro.
   warehouse and other indirect costs increased $7.3 million, primarily due to additional costs to support higher sales volume.
new loan and lease unit volume:
new loan and lease volume was $4.44 billion in 2015 compared to $4.46 billion in 2014. pfs finance market share on new paccar truck sales was 25.9% in 2015 compared to 27.7% in 2014 due to increased competition.
 results on returned lease assets increased depreciation and other expenses by $7.7 million, primarily due to lower gains on sales of returned lease units.
million in 2015, a decrease of $3.0 million compared to 2014, mainly due to improved portfolio performance in europe and the effects of translating weaker foreign currencies to the u.s. dollar, partially offset by higher portfolio balances in europe and the u.s. and canada. the company modifies loans and finance leases as a normal part of its financial services operations. the company may modify loans and finance leases for commercial reasons or for credit reasons. modifications for commercial reasons are changes to contract terms for customers that are not considered to be in financial difficulty. insignificant delays are modifications extending terms up to three months for customers experiencing some short-term financial stress, but not considered to be in financial difficulty. modifications for credit reasons are changes to contract terms for customers considered to be in financial difficulty. the companys modifications typically result in granting more time to pay the contractual amounts owed and charging a fee and interest for the term of the modification. when considering whether to modify customer accounts for credit reasons, the company evaluates the creditworthiness of the customers and modifies those accounts that the company considers likely to perform under the modified terms. when the company modifies loans and finance leases for credit reasons and grants a concession, the modifications are classified as troubled debt restructurings (tdr).

in 2015, total modification activity increased compared to 2014, primarily due to higher modifications for credit - tdrs, partially offset by the effects of translating weaker foreign currencies to the u.s. dollar and lower commercial modifications. tdr modifications increased primarily due to contract modifications in mexico. the decrease in commercial modifications reflects lower volumes of refinancing.
modifications of accounts in prior quarters that were more than 30 days past due at the time of modification are included in past dues if they were not performing under the modified terms at december 31, 2015 and 2014. the effect on the allowance for credit losses from such modifications was not significant at december 31, 2015 and 2014.
income taxes the 2015 effective income tax rate of 31.4% decreased from 32.7% in 2014. the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in research tax credits in 2015.
the improvement in income before income taxes and return on revenues for domestic operations was primarily due to higher revenues from trucks and parts operations and higher truck and parts margins. the increase in foreign income before income taxes was primarily due to higher revenues from trucks and parts operations and higher truck and parts margins, partially offset by translating weaker foreign currencies to the u.s. dollar, primarily the euro. the improvement in return on revenues for foreign operations was primarily due to higher revenues and margins from european truck and parts operations. liquidity and capital resources:

operating activities: cash provided by operations decreased by $255.2 million to $2.30 billion in 2016. lower operating cash flows reflect lower net income of $521.7 million in 2016, which includes payment of the $833.0 million ec charge, and higher pension contributions of $122.8 million. this was partially offset by $675.0 million from financial services segment wholesale receivables, whereby cash receipts exceeded originations in 2016 ($401.6 million) compared to originations exceeding cash receipts in 2015 ($273.4 million). in addition, there was a lower cash outflow for payment of income taxes of $281.4 million.
investing activities: cash used in investing activities decreased by $410.6 million to $1.56 billion in 2016 from $1.97 billion in 2015. lower net cash used in investing activities reflects $567.2 million from marketable debt securities as there was $272.9 million in net proceeds from sales of marketable debt securities in 2016 versus $294.3 million in net purchases of marketable debt securities in 2015 and higher net originations of retail loans and direct financing leases of $100.7 million. this was partially offset by higher cash used in the acquisitions of equipment for operating leases of $151.2 million and higher payments for property, plant and equipment of $88.5 million.
financing activities: cash used in financing activities was $823.5 million in 2016 compared to cash used in financing activities of $196.5 million in 2015. the company paid $829.3 million in dividends in 2016 compared to $680.5 million in 2015; the increase of $148.8 million was primarily due to an increase for the 2015 special dividend paid in january 2016. in 2016, the company issued $1.99 billion of term debt, repaid term debt of $1.63 billion and reduced its outstanding commercial paper and short-term bank loans by $322.8 million. in 2015, the company issued $1.99 billion of term debt, increased its outstanding commercial paper and short-term bank loans by $250.7 million and repaid term debt of $1.58 billion. this resulted in cash provided by borrowing activities of $46.9 million in 2016, $616.9 million lower than the cash provided by borrowing activities of $663.8 million in 2015. the company repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $70.5 million in 2016 compared to 3.8 million shares for $201.6 million in 2015, a decline of $131.1 million.
operating activities: cash provided by operations increased $432.4 million to $2.56 billion in 2015 compared to $2.12 billion in 2014. higher operating cash flow reflects $245.2 million of higher net income and $253.8 million from inventory as there was $64.3 million in net inventory reductions in 2015 vs. $189.5 million in net inventory purchases in 2014. in addition, higher cash inflows reflects $176.6 million from accounts receivables as collections exceeded sales in 2015 ($105.3 million) compared to sales exceeding collections in 2014 ($71.3 million). a lower increase in financial services sales-type finance leases and dealer direct loans on new trucks also contributed $126.5 million. these cash inflows were partially offset by cash outflows of $414.9 million from accounts payable and accrued expenses, where payments from goods and services exceeded purchases in 2015 ($162.6 million) compared to purchases exceeding payments in 2014 ($252.3 million).
investing activities: cash used in investing activities of $1.97 billion in 2015 increased $443.0 million from the $1.53 billion used in 2014, primarily due to higher cash used in the acquisitions of equipment for operating leases of $199.4 million, $169.7 million higher net purchases of marketable securities and $116.0 million in higher net originations of retail loans and direct financing leases in 2015. these outflows were partially offset by higher proceeds from asset disposals of $53.3 million.
financing activities: cash used in financing activities was $196.5 million in 2015 compared to $520.5 million in 2014. the company paid $680.5 million of dividends in 2015 compared to $623.8 million paid in 2014, an increase of $56.7 million. in addition, the company repurchased 3.8 million shares of common stock for $201.6 million in 2015 compared to .7 million shares for $42.7 million in 2014. in 2015, the company issued $1.99 billion of term debt and $250.7 million of commercial paper and short-term bank loans and repaid maturing term debt of $1.58 billion. in 2014, the company issued $1.65 billion of term debt and $349.1 million of commercial paper and short-term bank loans and repaid maturing term debt of $1.88 billion. this resulted in cash provided by borrowing activities of $663.8 million in 2015, $546.9 million higher than cash provided by borrowing activities of $116.9 million in 2014.
credit lines and other:
the company has line of credit arrangements of $3.43 billion, of which $3.22 billion were unused at december 31, 2016. included in these arrangements are $3.0 billion of syndicated bank facilities, of which $1.0 billion expires in june 2017, $1.0 billion expires in june 2020 and $1.0 billion expires in june 2021. the company intends to replace these credit facilities on or before expiration with facilities of similar amounts and duration. these credit facilities are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for commercial paper borrowings and maturing medium-term notes. there were no borrowings under the syndicated bank facilities for the year ended december 31, 2016.
at december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, the company had cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities of $1.33 billion and $1.82 billion, respectively, which are considered indefinitely reinvested in foreign subsidiaries. the company periodically repatriates foreign earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested. dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries to the u.s. parent were $.33 billion, $.24 billion and $.24 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the company believes that its u.s. cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities, future operating cash flow and access to the capital markets, along with periodic repatriation of foreign earnings, will be sufficient to meet u.s. liquidity requirements.
truck, parts and other the company provides funding for working capital, capital expenditures, r&d, dividends, stock repurchases and other business initiatives and commitments primarily from cash provided by operations. management expects this method of funding to continue in the future. on july 19, 2016, the ec concluded its investigation of all major european truck manufacturers and reached a settlement with daf under which the ec imposed a fine on daf of 752.7 million ($833.0 million) for infringement of european union competition rules. the fine is not tax deductible. in august 2016, daf paid the fine.
investments for property, plant and equipment in 2016 increased to $394.6 million from $306.5 million in 2015, reflecting additional investments for the construction of a new daf cab paint facility in europe, the peterbilt plant expansion in denton, texas and a new pdc in renton, washington. over the past decade, the companys combined investments in worldwide capital projects and r&d totaled $6.09 billion, and have significantly increased the operating capacity and efficiency of its facilities and enhanced the quality and operating efficiency of the companys premium products.
in 2017, capital investments are expected to be $375 to $425 million, and r&d is expected to be $250 to $280 million. the company is investing for future growth in paccars new truck models integrated powertrain, advanced driver assistance and truck connectivity technologies, and additional capacity and operating efficiency of the companys manufacturing and parts distribution facilities.
the company conducts business in certain countries which have been experiencing or may experience significant financial stress, fiscal or political strain and are subject to the corresponding potential for default. the company routinely monitors its financial exposure to global financial conditions, global counterparties and operating environments. as of december 31, 2016, the companys exposures in such countries were insignificant.
financial services the company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets. the primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and medium-term notes issued in the public markets and, to a lesser extent, bank loans. an additional source of funds is loans from other paccar companies.
the company issues commercial paper for a portion of its funding in its financial services segment. some of this commercial paper is converted to fixed interest rate debt through the use of interest-rate swaps, which are used to manage interest-rate risk.
in november 2015, the companys u.s. finance subsidiary, paccar financial corp. (pfc), filed a shelf registration under the securities act of 1933. the total amount of medium-term notes outstanding for pfc as of december 31, 2016 was $4.75 billion. the registration expires in november 2018 and does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued during that period.
as of december 31, 2016, the companys european finance subsidiary, paccar financial europe, had 1,313.4 million available for issuance under a 2.50 billion medium-term note program listed on the professional securities market of the london stock exchange. this program replaced an expiring program in the second quarter of 2016 and is renewable annually through the filing of new listing particulars.
in april 2016, paccar financial mexico registered a 10.00 billion peso medium-term note and commercial paper program with the comision nacional bancaria y de valores. the registration expires in april 2021 and limits the amount of commercial paper (up to one year) to 5.00 billion pesos. at december 31, 2016, 8.88 billion pesos were available for issuance.
in the event of a future significant disruption in the financial markets, the company may not be able to issue replacement commercial paper. as a result, the company is exposed to liquidity risk from the shorter maturity of short-term borrowings paid to lenders compared to the longer timing of receivable collections from customers. the company believes its cash balances and investments, collections on existing finance receivables, syndicated bank lines and current investment-grade credit ratings of a+/a1 will continue to provide it with sufficient resources and access to capital markets at competitive interest rates and therefore contribute to the company maintaining its liquidity and financial stability. a decrease in these credit ratings could negatively impact the companys ability to access capital markets at competitive interest rates and the companys ability to maintain liquidity and financial stability. paccar believes its financial services companies will be able to continue funding receivables, servicing debt and paying dividends through internally generated funds, access to public and private debt markets and lines of credit.

the company, its competitors and industry in general are subject to various domestic and foreign requirements relating to the environment. the company believes its policies, practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling, use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances have been in accordance with environmental laws and regulations in effect at the time such use and disposal occurred.
the company is involved in various stages of investigations and cleanup actions in different countries related to environmental matters. in certain of these matters, the company has been designated as a potentially responsible party by domestic and foreign environmental agencies. the company has accrued the estimated costs to investigate and complete cleanup actions where it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future. expenditures related to environmental activities in the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $2.2 million, $2.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively. management expects that these matters will not have a significant effect on the companys consolidated cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
critical accounting policies:
the companys significant accounting policies are disclosed in note a of the consolidated financial statements. in the preparation of the companys financial statements, in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented. the following are accounting policies which, in the opinion of management, are particularly sensitive and which, if actual results are different from estimates used by management, may have a material impact on the financial statements.
operating leases trucks sold pursuant to agreements accounted for as operating leases are disclosed in note e of the consolidated financial statements. in determining its estimate of the residual value of such vehicles, the company considers the length of the lease term, the truck model, the expected usage of the truck and anticipated market demand. operating lease terms generally range from three to five years. the resulting residual values on operating leases generally range between 30% and 60% of original equipment cost. if the sales price of the trucks at the end of the term of the agreement differs from the companys estimated residual value, a gain or loss will result.
future market conditions, changes in government regulations and other factors outside the companys control could impact the ultimate sales price of trucks returned under these contracts. residual values are reviewed regularly and adjusted if market conditions warrant. a decrease in the estimated equipment residual values would increase annual depreciation expense over the remaining lease term.
during 2016, market values on equipment returning upon operating lease maturity decreased, resulting in an increase in depreciation expense of $9.6 million. during 2015 and 2014, market values on equipment returning upon operating lease maturity were generally higher than the residual values on the equipment, resulting in a reduction in depreciation expense of $5.8 million and $10.6 million, respectively.
at december 31, 2016, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases in the financial services segment and residual value guarantee on trucks accounted for as operating leases in the truck segment was $2.31 billion. a 10% decrease in used truck values worldwide, if expected to persist over the remaining maturities of the companys operating leases, would reduce residual value estimates and result in the company recording an average of approximately $57.7 million of additional depreciation per year.
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses related to the companys loans and finance leases is disclosed in note d of the consolidated financial statements. the company has developed a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses for its two portfolio segments, retail and wholesale. the retail segment consists of retail loans and direct and sales-type finance leases, net of unearned interest. the wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing loans to dealers that are collateralized by trucks and other collateral. the wholesale segment generally has less risk than the retail segment. wholesale receivables generally are shorter in duration than retail receivables, and the company requires periodic reporting of the wholesale dealers financial condition, conducts periodic audits of the trucks being financed and in many cases, obtains guarantees or other security such as dealership assets. in determining the allowance for credit losses, retail loans and finance leases are evaluated together since they relate to a similar customer base, their contractual terms require regular payment of principal and interest, generally over 36 to 60 months, and they are secured by the same type of collateral. the allowance for credit losses consists of both specific and general reserves.
the company individually evaluates certain finance receivables for impairment. finance receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment consist of all wholesale accounts and certain large retail accounts with past due balances or otherwise determined to be at a higher risk of loss. a finance receivable is impaired if it is considered probable the company will be unable to collect all contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled. in addition, all retail loans and leases which have been classified as tdrs and all customer accounts over 90 days past due are considered impaired. generally, impaired accounts are on non-accrual status. impaired accounts classified as tdrs which have been performing for 90 consecutive days are placed on accrual status if it is deemed probable that the company will collect all principal and interest payments.
impaired receivables are generally considered collateral dependent. large balance retail and all wholesale impaired receivables are individually evaluated to determine the appropriate reserve for losses. the determination of reserves for large balance impaired receivables considers the fair value of the associated collateral. when the underlying collateral fair value exceeds the companys recorded investment, no reserve is recorded. small balance impaired receivables with similar risk characteristics are evaluated as a separate pool to determine the appropriate reserve for losses using the historical loss information discussed below.
the company evaluates finance receivables that are not individually impaired on a collective basis and determines the general allowance for credit losses for both retail and wholesale receivables based on historical loss information, using past due account data and current market conditions. information used includes assumptions regarding the likelihood of collecting current and past due accounts, repossession rates, the recovery rate on the underlying collateral based on used truck values and other pledged collateral or recourse. the company has developed a range of loss estimates for each of its country portfolios based on historical experience, taking into account loss frequency and severity in both strong and weak truck market conditions. a projection is made of the range of estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio from which an amount is determined as probable based on current market conditions and other factors impacting the creditworthiness of the companys borrowers and their ability to repay. after determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, a provision for losses on finance receivables is charged to income as necessary to reflect managements estimate of incurred credit losses, net of recoveries, inherent in the portfolio.
the adequacy of the allowance is evaluated quarterly based on the most recent past due account information and current market conditions. as accounts become past due, the likelihood that they will not be fully collected increases. the companys experience indicates the probability of not fully collecting past due accounts ranges between 20% and 70%. over the past three years, the companys year-end 30+ days past due accounts were .5% of loan and lease receivables. historically, a 100 basis point increase in the 30+ days past due percentage has resulted in an increase in credit losses of 5 to 30 basis points of receivables. at december 31, 2016, 30+ days past dues were .5%. if past dues were 100 basis points higher or 1.5% as of december 31, 2016, the companys estimate of credit losses would likely have increased by a range of $5 to $20 million depending on the extent of the past dues, the estimated value of the collateral as compared to amounts owed and general economic factors.
product warranty product warranty is disclosed in note h of the consolidated financial statements. the expenses related to product warranty are estimated and recorded at the time products are sold based on historical and current data and reasonable expectations for the future regarding the frequency and cost of warranty claims, net of recoveries. management takes actions to minimize warranty costs through quality-improvement programs; however, actual claim costs incurred could materially differ from the estimated amounts and require adjustments to the reserve. historically those adjustments have not been material. over the past three years, warranty expense as a percentage of truck, parts and other net sales and revenues has ranged between 1.3% and 1.8%. if the 2016 warranty expense had been .2% higher as a percentage of net sales and revenues in 2016, warranty expense would have increased by approximately $32 million.
pension benefits employee benefits are disclosed in note l of the consolidated financial statements. the companys accounting for employee pension benefit costs and obligations is based on management assumptions about the future used by actuaries to estimate net costs and liabilities. these assumptions include discount rates, long-term rates of return on plan assets, inflation rates, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. management bases these assumptions on historical results, the current environment and reasonable estimates of future events.
the discount rate for pension benefits is based on market interest rates of high quality corporate bonds with a maturity profile that matches the timing of the projected benefit payments of the plans. changes in the discount rate affect the valuation of the plan benefits obligation and funded status of the plans. the long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected returns for each asset class and relative weighting of those asset classes in the plans.
because differences between actual results and the assumptions for returns on plan assets, retirement rates and mortality rates are accumulated and amortized into expense over future periods, management does not believe these differences or a typical percentage change in these assumptions worldwide would have a material effect on its financial results in the next year. the most significant assumption which could negatively affect pension expense is a decrease in the discount rate. if the discount rate were to decrease .5%, 2016 net pension expense would increase to $92.9 million from $70.1 million and the projected benefit obligation would increase $208.0 million to $2.7 billion from $2.5 billion.
effective january 2017, the company will change the method used to estimate service cost and interest cost components of pension expense from a single weighted-average method, which is a single discount rate determined at the pension plans measurement date, to an individual spot rate approach, which applies specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows. this approach is a more precise measurement of net periodic benefit costs and does not impact the benefit obligation. the company considers this a change in estimate inseparable from a change in accounting principle, which will be accounted for prospectively. this change is expected to lower pension expense by approximately $15.0 million in 2017.
income taxes income taxes are disclosed in note m of the consolidated financial statements. the company calculates income tax expense on pre-tax income based on current tax law. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax consequences on temporary differences between recorded amounts in the financial statements and their respective tax basis. the determination of income tax expense requires management estimates and involves judgment regarding indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings, jurisdictional mix of earnings and future outcomes regarding tax law issues included in tax returns. the company updates its assumptions on all of these factors each quarter as well as new information on tax laws and differences between estimated taxes and actual returns when filed. if the companys assessment of these matters changes, the effect is accounted for in earnings in the period the change is made.
this report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements include statements relating to future results of operations or financial position and any other statement that does not relate to any historical or current fact. such statements are based on currently available operating, financial and other information and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may affect actual results. risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: a significant decline in industry sales; competitive pressures; reduced market share; reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; increased safety, emissions, or other regulations resulting in higher costs and/or sales restrictions; currency or commodity price fluctuations; lower used truck prices; insufficient or under-utilization of manufacturing capacity; supplier interruptions; insufficient liquidity in the capital markets; fluctuations in interest rates; changes in the levels of the financial services segment new business volume due to unit fluctuations in new paccar truck sales or reduced market shares; changes affecting the profitability of truck owners and operators; price changes impacting truck sales prices and residual values; insufficient supplier capacity or access to raw materials; labor disruptions; shortages of commercial truck drivers; increased warranty costs or litigation; or legislative and governmental regulations. a more detailed description of these and other risks is included under the heading part 1, item 1a, risk factors in the companys annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2016.

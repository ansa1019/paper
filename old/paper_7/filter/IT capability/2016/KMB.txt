item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this md&a is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our recent performance, financial condition and prospects. this discussion and analysis compares 2016 results to 2015, and 2015 results to 2014. the reference to "n.m." indicates that the calculation is not meaningful. in addition, we provide commentary regarding organic sales growth, which describes the impact of changes in volume, product mix and net selling prices on net sales. changes in foreign currency rates also impact the year-over-year change in net sales. dollar amounts are reported in millions, except per share dollar amounts, unless otherwise noted.
•   unaudited quarterly data
•   liquidity and capital resources
•   critical accounting policies and use of estimates
•   information concerning forward-looking statements throughout this md&a, we refer to financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s., or gaap, and are therefore referred to as non-gaap financial measures. these measures include adjusted operating profit, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted other (income) and expense, net, and adjusted effective tax rate. we believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the financial measures used to evaluate management.
non-gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable gaap measures, and they should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap.  there are limitations to these non-gaap financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculation and items being excluded.  we compensate for these limitations by using these non-gaap financial measures as a supplement to the gaap measures and by providing reconciliations of the non-gaap and comparable gaap financial measures.
the non-gaap financial measures exclude the following items for the relevant time periods as indicated in the reconciliations included later in this md&a:
•   2014 organization restructuring - in 2014, we initiated a restructuring plan in order to improve organization efficiency and offset the impact of stranded overhead costs resulting from the spin-off of our health care business. results in 2016, 2015 and 2014 include charges related to this initiative. see item 8, note 2, of the consolidated financial statements for details.
•   adjustments related to venezuelan operations - results in 2016 and 2015 include adjustments for the deconsolidation of our venezuelan operations, and in 2015 and 2014 include charges for remeasuring the local currency balance sheet in venezuela. see item 8, note 1 of the consolidated financial statements for details.
•   pension settlement charges - in 2015, we recorded settlement-related charges from certain actions taken for our u.s. pension plan. see item 8, note 9 of the consolidated financial statements for details.
•   uncertain tax positions adjustment - in 2015, we updated our assessment of uncertain tax positions for certain international operations, and recorded a charge related to prior years in provision for income taxes. see item 8, note 14 of the consolidated financial statements for details.
•   regulatory dispute in the middle east - in 2014, we recorded a charge as a result of an adverse court ruling regarding the treatment of capital contributions in prior years to an affiliate in the middle east.
•   european strategic changes and related restructuring charges - in 2012, we initiated strategic changes to, and a related restructuring in, our western and central european businesses. results in 2014 include charges related to this restructuring activity. see item 8, note 4 of the consolidated financial statements for details.

net income (loss) in the fourth quarter of 2015 was impacted by a $108 pre-tax charge ($102 after tax) to deconsolidate our venezuelan operations and a charge of $49 related to prior years for uncertain tax positions for certain international operations. results in 2015 also included charges related to pension settlements of $0.8 billion after tax ($1.4 billion pre-tax), primarily in the second quarter.
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations cash provided by operations was $3.2 billion in 2016 compared to $2.3 billion in 2015. the increase was driven by improved working capital and lower pension contributions. cash provided by operations was $2.8 billion in 2014. the decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 was driven by higher pension contributions in 2015, the spin-off of the health care business in the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased operating working capital.
unconditional purchase obligations        1,256                 681                 184                 187                 197                 5                  2
•   the unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials, primarily superabsorbent materials, pulp and utilities. although we are primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations, based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows, we believe exposure to losses, if any, under these arrangements is not material.
•   we will fund our defined benefit pension plans to meet or exceed statutory requirements and currently expect to contribute up to $100 to these plans in 2017.
•   other postretirement benefit payments are estimated using actuarial assumptions, including expected future service, to project the future obligations. based upon those projections, we anticipate making annual payments for these obligations ranging from $59 in 2017 to more than $61 by 2026.
•   accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, deferred taxes and noncontrolling interests.
investing our capital spending was $0.8 billion in 2016 and $1.1 billion in 2015. we expect capital spending to be $850 to $950 in 2017.
financing we issue long-term debt in the public market periodically. proceeds from the offerings are used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of maturing debt or outstanding commercial paper indebtedness. see item 8, note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for details.
our short-term debt, which consists of u.s. commercial paper with original maturities up to 90 days and/or other similar short-term debt issued by non-u.s. subsidiaries, was $170 as of december 31, 2016 (included in debt payable within one year on the consolidated balance sheet). the average month-end balance of short-term debt for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $227 and for the twelve months ended december 31, 2016 was $512. these short-term borrowings provide supplemental funding for supporting our operations. the level of short-term debt generally fluctuates depending upon the amount of operating cash flows and the timing of customer receipts and payments for items such as pension contributions, dividends and income taxes.
we maintain a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in 2021. this facility, currently unused, supports our commercial paper program, and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason.
we paid $1.3 billion in dividends in 2016. the board of directors approved a dividend increase of 5.4 percent for 2017. we repurchase shares of kimberly-clark common stock from time to time pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. during 2016, we repurchased 6.0 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $750 through a broker in the open market. we are targeting full-year 2017 share repurchases of $800 to $1,000, subject to market conditions.
management believes that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending, payment of dividends, pension plan contributions and other needs for the foreseeable future. further, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the united states to have a material effect on our overall business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future.
22      kimberly-clark corporation - 2016 annual report critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. the critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used. the critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances, pension and other postretirement benefits, deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments. these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors.
sales incentives and trade promotion allowances trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees, cooperative marketing programs, temporary price reductions, end-of-aisle or in-store product displays and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products. rebate and promotion accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales and the promotion accruals also consider estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and timing and costs of activities within the promotional programs. generally, the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption, influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories. our related accounting policies are discussed in item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
employee postretirement benefits pension plans we have defined benefit pension plans in the united states and the united kingdom (the "principal plans") and/or defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees. certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or, in certain countries, termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees. our related accounting policies and account balances, as well as the 2015 transaction related to our u.s. pension plan, are discussed in item 8, note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
changes in certain assumptions could affect pension expense and the benefit obligations, particularly the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate the obligations:
as of december 31, 2016, the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately $1.5 billion. these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns, (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations, or (iii) other actuarial gains, including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the "corridor" as required. if the expected long-term rates of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 0.25 percent, the impact on annual pension expense would not be material in 2017.
•   discount rate. the discount (or settlement) rate used to determine the present value of our future u.s. pension obligation at december 31, 2016 was based on a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with cash flows that largely match the expected benefit payments of the plan. for the u.k. plan, the discount rate was determined based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities. each year's expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate to determine the pension obligations. if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, the increase in annual pension expense would not be material in 2017, and the december 31, 2016 pension liability would increase by about $140.
•   other assumptions. there are a number of other assumptions involved in the calculation of pension expense and benefit obligations, primarily related to participant demographics and benefit elections.
23      kimberly-clark corporation - 2016 annual report pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate $65 in 2017. pension expense beyond 2017 will depend on future investment performance, our contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans.
other postretirement benefit plans substantially all u.s. retirees and employees have access to our unfunded healthcare and life insurance benefit plans. changes in significant assumptions could affect the consolidated expense and benefit obligations, particularly the discount rates used to calculate the obligations and the healthcare cost trend rate:
•   discount rate. the determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above, and the methodology for each country is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate for that country's pension obligation. if the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, the impact to 2017 other postretirement benefit expense and the increase in the december 31, 2016 benefit liability would not be material. the discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for our consolidated operations may appear different due to the unique benefit payments of the plans.

deferred income taxes and potential assessments as a global organization we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the u.s. and internationally. changes in certain assumptions related to income taxes could significantly affect consolidated results, particularly with regard to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside the u.s. and uncertain tax positions:
•   deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances. we have recorded deferred tax assets related to, among other matters, income tax loss carryforwards, income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards and have established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets. these carryforwards are primarily in non-u.s. taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the u.s. foreign tax credits earned in the u.s. in current and prior years, which cannot be used currently, also give rise to net deferred tax assets. in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets, many factors are considered, including the specific taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward period, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction. a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
•   unremitted earnings. as of december 31, 2016, u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $8.9 billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the u.s. these earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely. however, they would be subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends, were lent to one of our u.s. entities or if we were to sell our stock in the subsidiaries. it is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred u.s. income tax liability on these unremitted earnings. we periodically determine whether our non-u.s. subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination, as appropriate.
•   uncertain tax positions. we record our global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which we operate. where we believe that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in our income tax returns. where treatment of a position is uncertain, a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter. these liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations. we currently believe that the ultimate resolution of matters subject to administrative appeals, litigation or other uncertainty, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

business outlook in 2017, we plan to continue to execute our global business plan strategies, which include a focus on targeted growth initiatives, innovation and brand building, cost savings programs and shareholder-friendly capital allocation. in 2017, we expect earnings per share in a range of $6.20 to $6.35. our outlook is based on the assumptions described below:
•   we expect net sales to be similar to the prior year impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate changes of 2 percent. we also expect unfavorable foreign currency translation effects to negatively impact operating profit growth by 2 percent. currency transaction effects are also anticipated to negatively impact comparisons.
•   we expect operating profit to improve compared to 2016 and to be up 2 to 4 percent compared to adjusted operating profit in 2016.
•   we anticipate the net impact of changes in commodity costs to be between $50 and $200 of inflation, primarily due to inflation in international markets.
•   we expect the net income from equity companies to decline due to lower income at k-c de mexico as a result of a weaker mexican peso.
•   we anticipate capital spending to be in a $850 to $950 range and share repurchases to be between $800 and $1 billion, subject to market conditions.
•   we expect to contribute up to $100 to our defined benefit pension plans.

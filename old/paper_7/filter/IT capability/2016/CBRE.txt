item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the worlds largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2016 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world. we provide services in the office, retail, industrial, multifamily and hotel sectors of commercial real estate. as of december 31, 2016, we operated in approximately 450 offices worldwide with more than 75,000 employees, excluding independent affiliates, providing commercial real estate services under the cbre brand name, investment management services under the cbre global investors brand name and development services under the trammell crow company brand name. our business is focused on commercial property, corporate facilities, project and transaction management, tenant/occupier and property/agency leasing, capital markets solutions (property sales, commercial mortgage brokerage, loan origination and servicing) real estate investment management, valuation, development services and proprietary research. we generate revenue from both management fees (large multi-year portfolio and per-project contracts) and from commissions on transactions. we have been included in the fortune 500 since 2008 (ranking #259 in 2016) and among the fortune most admired companies in the real estate sector for five consecutive years, including 2017. in 2016, we were ranked by forbes as the 15th best employer in america, and the international association of outsourcing professionals (iaop) has ranked us among the top few outsourcing service providers across all industries for five consecutive years. additionally, we were one of only two companies to be ranked in the top 12 in the barrons 500, which evaluates companies on growth and financial performance, in each of 2014, 2015 and 2016.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, or gaap, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable. actual results may differ from those estimates. we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition in order for us to recognize revenue, four basic criteria must be met:
   collectability is reasonably assured.
our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria. the judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time and method to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms. each transaction is evaluated to determine: (i) at what point in time or over what period of time revenue is earned; (ii) whether contingencies exist that impact the timing of recognition of revenue; and (iii) how and when such contingencies will be resolved. the timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made. our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue and incentive-based management and development fees. for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies, see the revenue recognition section within note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, or this annual report.
in establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables, we make assumptions with respect to future collectability. our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customers credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivables balances. in addition to these assessments, in general, outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible. historically, our credit losses have generally been insignificant. however, estimating losses requires significant judgment, and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation. as a result, actual credit losses may differ from our estimates.
goodwill and other intangible assets our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value. the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, we use a variety of valuation methods including present value, depreciated replacement cost, market values (where available) and selling prices less costs to dispose. we are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
assumptions must often be made in determining fair values, particularly where observable market values do not exist. assumptions may include discount rates, growth rates, cost of capital, royalty rates, tax rates and remaining useful lives. these assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded. different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities. since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense, different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future asset impairment reviews.
we are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status. the goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process. the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill. we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model. these assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc. if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered to not be impaired. if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a businesss fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
for additional information on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing, see notes 2 and 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report.
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the accounting for income taxes, topic of the financial accounting standards board, or fasb, accounting standards codification, or asc, (topic 740). deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary
differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
accounting for tax positions requires judgments, including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties. we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods. while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with topic 740, as applicable, the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material.
our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated $1.9 billion of undistributed earnings for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability. although tax liabilities might result from dividends being paid out of these earnings, or as a result of a sale or liquidation of non-u.s. subsidiaries, these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the united states and we do not have any plans to repatriate them or to sell or liquidate any of our non-u.s. subsidiaries. to the extent that we are able to repatriate earnings in a tax efficient manner, we would be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes to repatriate these funds, net of foreign tax credits. determining our tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable. cash and cash equivalents owned by non-u.s. subsidiaries totaled $408.9 million at december 31, 2016.
see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report for further information regarding income taxes.
new accounting pronouncements see new accounting pronouncements section within note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report.
seasonality a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. historically, our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first quarter, and highest in the fourth quarter of each year. revenue, earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales, financing and leasing transactions prior to year-end.
inflation our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by commercial real estate market supply and demand, which may be affected by inflation. however, to date, we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations.
items affecting comparability when you read our financial statements and the information included in this annual report on form 10-k, you should consider that we have experienced, and continue to experience, several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results. we believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future.
macroeconomic conditions economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly. these include: overall economic activity and employment growth; interest rate levels and changes in interest rates; the cost and availability of credit; and the impact of tax and regulatory policies. periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal uncertainty, declining employment levels, decreasing demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, will negatively affect the performance of our business.
compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our advisory services business generally are paid on a commission and/or bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production. as a result, the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure. in addition, when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe, we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance, and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved. nevertheless, adverse global and regional economic trends could pose significant risks to the performance of our operations and our financial condition.
commercial real estate markets have recovered over the past several years, along with the steady improvement in global economic activity, most particularly in the united states. since 2010, u.s. leasing markets have been marked by increased demand for space, falling vacancies and higher rents. during this time, healthy u.s. property sales activity has been sustained by gradually improving market fundamentals, low-cost credit availability and increased global and domestic capital flows. property sales volumes slowed in 2016 following several years of strong growth; however, the market remained active. commercial mortgage services activity rose in 2016 driven by lower interest rates and a favorable lending environment. lending for multi-family properties in the united states was particularly robust, reflecting strong activity with u.s. government sponsored enterprises (gses) as well as a long-term trend of increased renting versus home ownership in the united states.
european economies began to emerge from recession in 2013, with most countries returning to positive, albeit modest, economic growth. sales and leasing activity in europe has improved across most of europe for much of the past two years. an exception is london, where uncertainty in advance of and following the united kingdoms referendum to leave the european union, commonly referred to as brexit, constrained occupier and investor activity in 2016.
in asia pacific, the performance of real estate leasing and investment markets has varied from country to country amid slowing economic growth. leasing and investment market activity was generally soft for much of 2016, but picked up noticeably in the fourth quarter. however, local capital from the asia-pacific region continues to migrate to other parts of the world.
real estate investment management and property development markets have been generally favorable with abundant debt and equity capital flows into commercial real estate. real estate equity securities markets weakened in the fourth quarter of 2016 amid concerns about potentially higher interest rates.
the performance of our global real estate services and real estate investment businesses depends on sustained economic growth and job creation; stable, healthy global credit markets; and continued positive business and investor sentiment.
effects of acquisitions we historically have made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies, to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around
the world. on september 1, 2015, cbre, inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, pursuant to a stock and asset purchase agreement with johnson controls, inc. (jci), acquired jcis global workplace solutions (jci-gws) business (which we refer to as the gws acquisition). the acquired jci-gws business was a market-leading provider of integrated facilities management solutions for major occupiers of commercial real estate and had significant operations around the world. the purchase price was $1.475 billion, paid in cash, plus adjustments totaling $46.5 million for working capital and other items. we completed the gws acquisition in order to advance our strategy of delivering globally integrated services to major occupiers in our americas, emea and asia pacific segments. we merged the acquired jci-gws business with our existing occupier outsourcing business line, and the new combined business adopted the global workplace solutions name.
strategic in-fill acquisitions have also played a key role in expanding our geographic coverage and broadening and strengthening our service offerings. the companies we acquired have generally been regional or specialty firms that complement our existing platform, or independent affiliates in which, in some cases, we held a small equity interest. in early 2017, we acquired a leading software as a service (saas) platform that produces scalable interactive visualization technologies for commercial real estate and a national boutique commercial real estate finance and consulting firm in the united states. during 2016, we acquired our independent affiliate in norway, a london-based retail property advisor specializing in the luxury goods retail sector and a leading provider of retail project management, shopping center development and tenant coordination services in the united states. we also made an equity investment in a property services firm in malaysia, acquiring a 49% interest. during 2015, we completed eight in-fill acquisitions, including a seattle-based leader in capital markets services for affordable housing, a texas-based commercial real estate firm specializing in retail services, an energy management specialist based in brookfield, wisconsin, a chicago-based location data analytics firm, one of the leading retail real estate services firms in the midwestern united states, an advisory, consulting and research firm specializing in the canadian hospitality and tourism industries and our former independent affiliate companies in columbia, south carolina, and memphis, tennessee.
we believe that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost, time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets. in general, however, most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income as a result of transaction-related expenditures. these include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others, and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own.
our acquisition structures often include deferred and/or contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions. as of december 31, 2016, we have accrued deferred consideration totaling $91.0 million, which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report.
international operations we are monitoring the economic and political developments related to brexit and the potential impact on our businesses in the united kingdom and the rest of europe, including, in particular, sales and leasing activity in the united kingdom, as well as any associated currency volatility impact on our results of operations.
as we continue to increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth, fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. our global investment management business has a significant amount of euro-denominated assets under management, or aum, as well as associated revenue and earnings in europe. in addition, our global workplace solutions business also has a significant amount of its revenue and earnings denominated in foreign currencies, such as the euro and the british pound sterling, which has significantly declined in value as compared to the u.s. dollar and other currencies as a
result of brexit. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our aum, revenue and earnings.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, approximately 47% of our business was transacted in non-u.s. dollar currencies, the majority of which included the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, chinese yuan, danish krone, euro, hong kong dollar, indian rupee, japanese yen, mexican peso, polish zloty, singapore dollar, swedish krona, swiss franc and thai baht. the following table sets forth our revenue derived from our most significant currencies (u.s. dollars in thousands):
united states dollar               $6,917,221              52.9   %              $5,991,826              55.2   %              $5,027,479              55.6   %
british pound sterling              2,008,776              15.4   %               1,861,199              17.1   %               1,632,127              18.0   %
although we operate globally, we report our results in u.s. dollars. as a result, the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar may positively or negatively impact our reported results. for example, we estimate that had the british pound sterling-to-u.s. dollar exchange rates been 10% higher during the year ended december 31, 2016, the net impact would have been an increase in pre-tax income of $4.9 million. had the euro-to-u.s. dollar exchange rates been 10% higher during the year ended december 31, 2016, the net impact would have been an increase in pre-tax income of $3.7 million. these hypothetical calculations estimate the impact of translating results into u.s. dollars and do not include an estimate of the impact that a 10% change in the u.s. dollar against other currencies would have had on our foreign operations.
we enter into derivative financial instruments to attempt to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar. in march 2014, we began a foreign currency exchange forward hedging program (which expired in december 2016) by entering into foreign currency exchange forward contracts, including agreements to buy u.s. dollars and sell australian dollars, british pound sterling, canadian dollars, euros and japanese yen. the purpose of these forward contracts was to attempt to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that would adversely impact some of our foreign currency denominated ebitda. hedge accounting was not elected for any of these contracts. as such, changes in the fair values of these contracts were recorded directly in earnings. included in the consolidated statement of operations set forth in item 8 of this annual report were net gains of $7.7 million , $24.2 million and $5.3 million from foreign currency exchange forward contracts for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. as of december 31, 2016, we had no foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding as the program has been terminated. we do not intend to hedge our foreign currency denominated ebitda in 2017.
due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results. in addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the u.s. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. our international operations also are subject to, among other things, political instability and changing regulatory environments, which affects the currency markets and which as a result may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations. we routinely monitor these risks and related costs and evaluate the appropriate amount of oversight to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant.

fee revenue, ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized measurements under gaap. when analyzing our operating performance, investors should use these measures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap. we
generally use these non-gaap financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes. we believe these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business. because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of fee revenue, ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
fee revenue is gross revenue less both client reimbursed costs largely associated with employees that are dedicated to client facilities and subcontracted vendor work performed for clients. we believe that investors may find this measure useful to analyze the companys overall financial performance because it excludes costs reimbursable by clients, and as such provides greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business.
ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. amounts shown for adjusted ebitda further remove (from ebitda) the impact of certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisitions, cost-elimination expenses and certain carried interest incentive compensation (reversal) expense to align with the timing of associated revenue. we believe that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions, the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending.
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our discretionary use because they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. these measures may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments. we also use adjusted ebitda as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs.
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):

cost structure after several years of significant revenue and related cost growth. cost-elimination expenses incurred during the year ended december 31, 2016 consisted of $73.6 million of severance costs related to headcount reductions in connection with the program and $4.9 million of third-party contract termination costs. cost-elimination expenses incurred during the year ended december 31, 2015 consisted of
$32.6 million of severance costs related to headcount reductions in connection with the program and $7.8 million of third-party contract termination costs. the total amount for each period does have a cash impact.
we reported consolidated net income of $572.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 on revenue of $13.1 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $547.1 million on revenue of $10.9 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015.
our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31, 2016 increased by $2.2 billion, or 20.4%, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. this increase was largely due to contributions from the gws acquisition, which added $1.8 billion of revenue, with a full year of activity reflected in the current year versus only four months of activity in 2015. additionally, the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the gws acquisition, up 14.0%), as well as increased leasing (up 6.7%), commercial mortgage brokerage (up 19.1%) and sales (up 1.4%) activity. these increases were partially offset by lower carried interest revenue in the current year as well as foreign currency translation, which had a $277.8 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the british pound sterling.
our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by $2.0 billion, or 28.8%, during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to same period in 2015. this increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing business, particularly due to the gws acquisition. in addition, our sales professionals generally are paid on a commission basis, which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance. accordingly, the increase in sales and lease transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission expense. we also incurred $18.9 million of additional costs in 2016 versus 2015 in connection with our cost-elimination project that began in the fourth quarter of 2015 and ended in the third quarter of 2016 to enhance margins and reduce our global cost structure going forward (the expenses of which primarily consisted of severance costs related to headcount reductions and third-party contract termination costs). these increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $205.5 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31, 2016. cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 65.2% for the year ended december 31, 2015 to 69.8% for the year ended december 31, 2016, largely due to the gws acquisition. excluding activity associated with the acquired jci-gws business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 62.5% for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to 64.0% for the year ended december 31, 2016. this increase was partly driven by the aforementioned increase in costs incurred in connection with our cost-elimination project in 2016 and lower non-commissionable revenue in the current year. in addition, outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the gws acquisition), which has a lower margin than sales and lease transaction revenue, was a lower percentage of revenue in 2015 than in 2016.
our operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by $147.7 million, or 5.6%, during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was mostly driven by costs associated with the gws acquisition. also contributing to the variance were higher worldwide payroll-related costs (particularly bonuses largely attributable to improved results, most notably in our development services segment). lastly, we incurred an additional $19.1 million of costs in 2016 versus 2015 in connection with our cost-elimination project. these items were partly offset by lower carried interest expense as well as foreign currency, which had a net $46.2 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2016, including $10.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity over the same period last year, much of which related to hedging activities, that was more than offset by a $57.1 million positive impact from foreign currency translation. operating expenses as a percentage of revenue
decreased from 24.3% for the year ended december 31, 2015 to 21.3% for the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily due to the gws acquisition. excluding activity associated with the acquired jci-gws business, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 25.7% for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 24.7% for the same period in 2016, partly driven by the lower carried interest expense in the current year.
our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $52.8 million, or 16.8%, during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. this increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense related to intangibles acquired in the gws acquisition, with a full year of amortization reflected in the current year versus only four months of amortization in 2015. a rise in depreciation expense during the year ended december 31, 2016 driven by technology-related capital expenditures also contributed to the increase.
our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by $34.5 million, or 21.2%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales reported in our development services segment.
our consolidated interest expense increased by $26.0 million, or 21.8%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. this increase was primarily driven by interest expense in the current year associated with $600.0 million of 4.875% senior notes issued in august 2015 as well as higher interest expense associated with borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement dated january 9, 2015 (2015 credit agreement) due to an increase in interest rates.
our write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt on a consolidated basis was $2.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. these costs included the write-off of $1.7 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with our prior credit agreement dated march 28, 2013, as amended (2013 credit agreement), and $1.0 million of fees incurred in connection with our 2015 credit agreement.
our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $296.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to $320.9 million for the same period in 2015. our effective tax rate, after adjusting pre-tax income to remove the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, decreased to 34.1% for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 37.0% for the year ended december 31, 2015. we experienced a favorable change in earnings mix in the current year, with 60% of our earnings, after removing the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, from the united states for 2016 versus 68% for 2015. in addition, we realized certain discrete tax benefits in the current year that were not applicable in 2015. these items were offset, in part, by higher losses sustained in the current year in jurisdictions where no tax benefit could be provided.
we reported consolidated net income of $547.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 on revenue of $10.9 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $484.5 million on revenue of $9.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014.
our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased by $1.8 billion, or 20.0%, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was in part due to contributions from the gws acquisition from september 1, 2015 through december 31, 2015. additionally, the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the gws acquisition, up 15.4%) and property management fees (up 17.5%), as well as increased sales (up 17.9%) and leasing (up 11.5%) activity. an increase in global appraisal revenue (up 18.6%) and commercial mortgage brokerage activity in our americas segment (up 28.5%) also contributed to the positive variance. foreign currency translation had a $536.4 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, euro and japanese yen during the year ended december 31, 2015 versus the year ended december 31, 2014.
our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by $1.5 billion, or 26.2%, during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing and property management businesses, particularly due to the gws acquisition. in addition, as previously mentioned, our sales professionals generally are paid on a commission basis, which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance. accordingly, the increase in sales and lease transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission expense. lastly, we incurred $18.3 million of costs in connection with our cost-elimination project. these increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $318.4 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31, 2015. cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 62.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014 to 65.2% for the year ended december 31, 2015, largely due to the gws acquisition. excluding activity associated with the acquired jci-gws business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 62.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to 62.5% for the year ended december 31, 2015.
our operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by $194.6 million, or 8.0%, during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was partly driven by costs associated with the gws acquisition. also contributing to the variance were higher worldwide payroll-related costs (including bonuses) attributable to increased headcount and improved results as well as higher consulting, marketing and travel costs. lastly, we incurred $22.1 million of costs in connection with our cost-elimination project. these increases were partially mitigated by an $8.6 million asset impairment charge incurred in our americas segment during the year ended december 31, 2014, which did not recur during the year ended december 31, 2015, and foreign currency movement. foreign currency translation had a $162.3 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2015 and there was an improvement of $20.7 million in foreign currency transaction activity over the year ended december 31, 2014, much of which related to hedging activities. operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 27.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014 to 24.3% for the year ended december 31, 2015, partially due to the gws acquisition. excluding activity associated with the acquired jci-gws business, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 27.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to 25.7% for the year ended december 31, 2015.
our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $49.0 million, or 18.5%, during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense relative to intangibles acquired in the gws acquisition as well as increased amortization expense associated with mortgage servicing rights. a rise in depreciation expense during the year ended december 31, 2015 driven by technology-related capital expenditures also contributed to the increase.
our gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis was $10.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $57.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. these gains resulted from activity within our global investment management and development services segments.
our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by $61.1 million, or 60.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales reported in our development services segment.
our consolidated interest expense increased by $6.8 million, or 6.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was primarily driven by higher interest expense during the year ended december 31, 2015 associated with $600.0 million of 4.875% senior notes issued in august 2015 as well as the 5.25% senior notes issued in september 2014 and december 2014 of $300.0 million and $125.0 million, respectively. these increases were partially offset by lower interest expense associated with $350.0 million of 6.625% senior notes, which were redeemed in full in october 2014, as well as lower interest expense due to a decrease in notes payable on real estate during the year ended december 31, 2015.
our write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt on a consolidated basis was $2.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $23.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the costs incurred during the year ended december 31, 2015 included the write-off of $1.7 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with our 2013 credit agreement, and $1.0 million of fees incurred in connection with our 2015 credit agreement. the costs incurred during the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily related to costs associated with the redemption in full of our 6.625% senior notes, including a $17.4 million early extinguishment premium and the write-off of $5.7 million of previously deferred financing costs. see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report for more information on such credit agreements.
our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $320.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $263.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was driven by the significant growth in pre-tax income during the year ended december 31, 2015. our effective tax rate, after adjusting pre-tax income to remove the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, increased to 37.0% for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 35.3% for the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was largely due to the reversal of accrued taxes, interest and penalties related to settled positions, which had a favorable impact on the 2014 effective tax rate and did not recur in 2015.

(1)   during 2016, we changed our methodology for allocating certain costs to our reporting segments, including stock compensation, currency hedging and certain intercompany transactions. prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. such changes had no impact on our consolidated results.
americas revenue increased by $1.0 billion, or 16.7%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. this increase was in part due to contributions from the gws acquisition, which added $641.6 million of revenue, with a full year of activity reflected in the current year versus only four months of activity in 2015. additionally, the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the gws acquisition, up 10.4%), as well as improved leasing and commercial mortgage brokerage activity. foreign currency translation had a $30.6 million negative impact on revenue during the year ended december 31, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the canadian dollar and mexican peso.
cost of services increased by $918.2 million, or 22.3%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing business, particularly due to the gws acquisition. also contributing to the variance was higher commission expense resulting from improved lease transaction revenue. we also incurred $10.3 million of additional costs in 2016 versus 2015 in connection with our cost-elimination project. foreign currency translation had a $21.8 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31, 2016. cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 69.7% for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 66.5% for the same period in 2015, largely due to the gws acquisition. excluding activity associated with the acquired jci-gws business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 66.2% for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to 65.2% for the year ended december 31, 2015, partly driven by the aforementioned costs associated with our cost-elimination project.
operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $78.9 million, or 6.2%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was partly driven by costs associated with the gws acquisition as well as higher payroll-related costs, including an increase in 401(k) contributions in the united states. higher software license and maintenance contract costs also contributed to the increase. foreign currency had a net $4.5 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2016, which included a positive impact from foreign currency translation of $6.2 million, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity, mostly hedging related, of $1.7 million.
in connection with the origination and sale of mortgage loans for which the company retains servicing rights, we record servicing assets or liabilities based on the fair value of the retained mortgage servicing rights (msrs) on the date the loans are sold. we also assume or purchase certain servicing assets. gains from mortgage servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value within revenue. subsequent to the initial recording, msrs are amortized (within amortization expense) and carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value in other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. they are amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period that the servicing income is expected to be received. in any given period, the net of gains from msrs less related amortization equals the net non-cash impact to operating income from such activity (net msrs). for the year ended december 31, 2016, net msrs increased $29.6 million over the same period in the prior year. for the year ended december 31, 2016, net msrs contributed $80.7 million to operating income, consisting of $154.0 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $73.3 million of amortization of related intangible assets. for the year ended december 31, 2015, net msrs contributed $51.1 million to operating income, consisting of $110.4 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $59.3 million of amortization of related intangible assets.
emea revenue increased by $913.5 million, or 30.4%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. this increase was largely due to contributions from the gws acquisition, which
added $924.9 million of revenue, with a full year of activity reflected in the current year versus only four months of activity in 2015. in addition, the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the gws acquisition, up 15.8%). leasing activity was up slightly and sales activity was flat versus the prior year. foreign currency translation had a $232.6 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the british pound sterling.
cost of services increased by $821.8 million, or 37.3%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. this increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing business, particularly due to the gws acquisition. we also incurred $9.3 million of additional costs in 2016 versus 2015 in connection with our cost-elimination project. these increases were partially reduced by foreign currency translation, which had a $177.8 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31, 2016. cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 77.3% for the year ended december 31, 2016 from 73.4% for the year ended december 31, 2015, largely due to the gws acquisition. excluding activity associated with the acquired jci-gws business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 69.0% for both the year ended december 31, 2016 and 2015.
operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $73.6 million, or 11.9%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily driven by higher costs associated with the gws acquisition. higher payroll-related costs (including bonuses) in the current year also contributed to the variance. these increases were partially mitigated by foreign currency, which had a $44.2 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2016, including $1.0 million in favorable foreign currency transaction activity over the same period last year, much of which related to hedging activities, and a $43.2 million positive impact from foreign currency translation.
asia pacific revenue increased by $350.9 million, or 30.9%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. this increase was largely due to contributions from the gws acquisition, which added $229.4 million of revenue, with a full year of activity reflected in the current year versus only four months of activity in 2015. the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the gws acquisition, up 33.4%) as well as improved sales and leasing activity. this increase was partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $2.8 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the chinese yuan and indian rupee, largely mitigated by strength in the japanese yen.
cost of services increased by $300.8 million, or 39.5%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, driven by higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing businesses, including the acquired gws business. this was partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $5.9 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31, 2016. cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 71.5% for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to 67.1% for the same period in 2015, primarily due to the gws acquisition. excluding activity associated with the acquired jci-gws business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 65.6% for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to 64.1% for the same period in 2015, primarily driven by our revenue mix, with outsourcing revenue, which has a lower margin than sales and lease revenue, being a higher percentage of revenue than in the prior year.
operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $24.4 million, or 8.9%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015, mainly driven by costs associated with the gws acquisition. additionally, foreign currency activity had an overall negative impact of $7.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, due to unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity, mostly related to hedging.
global investment management revenue decreased by $90.9 million, or 19.7%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. this decrease was primarily driven by lower carried interest revenue as well as lower acquisition, asset management and incentive fees in the current year. foreign currency translation had an $11.8 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the british pound sterling.
operating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $50.8 million, or 14.6%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily driven by lower carried interest expense incurred in the current year. additionally, foreign currency had a net $5.0 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2016, which included $2.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity over the same period last year, much of which related to hedging activities, that was more than offset by a $7.7 million positive impact from foreign currency translation. these decreases were partially offset by $19.8 million of additional costs in 2016 versus 2015 in connection with our cost-elimination project.
a roll forward of our aum by product type for the year ended december 31, 2016 is as follows (dollars in billions):
funds          separate          securities            total accounts balance at january 1, 2016               $28.3             $39.9               $20.8            $89.0

aum generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide (or participate in) oversight, investment management services and other advice, and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans, securities portfolios and investments in operating companies and joint ventures. our aum is intended principally to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market, not the basis for determining our management fees. our assets under management consist of:
                                                     the total fair market value of the real estate properties and other assets either wholly-owned or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested or to which they have provided financing. committed (but unfunded) capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in this component of our aum. the value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost. in the case of real estate operating companies, the total value of real properties controlled by the companies, generally through joint ventures, is included in aum; and
   the net asset value of our managed securities portfolios, including investments (which may be comprised of committed but uncalled capital) in private real estate funds under our fund of funds program.
development services revenue increased by $5.8 million, or 8.8%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily driven by higher development fees in the current year.
operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $21.6 million, or 18.3%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. this increase was primarily driven by higher bonuses in the current year as a result of significantly improved operating performance due to property sales (reflected in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and gain on disposition of real estate).
as of december 31, 2016, development projects in process totaled $6.6 billion, down $100 million from year-end 2015. the new projects pipeline totaled $4.2 billion, up $600 million from a year ago.
americas revenue increased by $986.1 million, or 19.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was in part due to contributions from the gws acquisition. additionally, the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the gws acquisition, up 10.8%) and property management fees (up 14.7%), as well as improved sales, leasing, commercial mortgage brokerage and appraisal activity. foreign currency translation had an $85.6 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the brazilian real and canadian dollar when converting to u.s. dollars during the year ended december 31, 2015 versus the year ended december 31, 2014.
cost of services increased by $717.8 million, or 21.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily due to higher costs associated with our property management and occupier outsourcing businesses, particularly due to the gws acquisition. this increase was also due to higher commission expense resulting from improved sales and lease transaction revenue. additionally, higher salaries and related costs due to increased headcount (in part due to in-fill acquisitions) also contributed to the increase. foreign currency translation had a $52.8 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31, 2015. cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 66.5% for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 65.3% for the year ended december 31, 2014, largely due to the gws acquisition. excluding activity associated with the acquired jci-gws business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 65.2% for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to 65.3% for the year ended december 31, 2014.
operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $155.8 million, or 13.9%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was partly driven by costs associated with the gws acquisition. also contributing to the variance were higher payroll-related costs (including bonuses) attributable to increased headcount and improved results as well as higher consulting, marketing and travel costs. these increases were partially mitigated by an $8.6 million asset impairment charge incurred in our americas segment during the year ended december 31, 2014, which did not recur during the year ended december 31, 2015, and foreign currency movement. foreign currency translation had a $24.5 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2015 and there was an improvement of $19.1 million in foreign currency transaction activity over the year ended december 31, 2014, some of which related to hedging activities.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, net msrs increased $26.1 million over the same period in 2014. for the year ended december 31, 2015, net msrs contributed $51.1 million to operating income, consisting of $110.4 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $59.3 million of amortization of related intangible assets. for the year ended december 31, 2014, net msrs contributed $25.0 million to operating income, consisting of $73.9 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $48.9 million of amortization of related intangible assets.
emea revenue increased by $660.2 million, or 28.2%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was largely due to contributions from the gws acquisition. in addition, the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the gws acquisition up 19.4%) and property management fees (up 25.9%), as well as improved sales, leasing and appraisal activity. the increase in revenue was partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $291.6 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the british pound sterling and euro when converting to u.s. dollars during the year ended december 31, 2015 versus the year ended december 31, 2014.
cost of services increased by $599.7 million, or 37.3%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our property management and occupier outsourcing businesses, particularly due to the gws acquisition. additionally, we incurred $9.7 million of costs in connection with our cost-elimination project. these increases were partially reduced by foreign currency translation, which had a $192.9 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31, 2015. cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 73.4% for the year ended december 31, 2015 from 68.5% for the year ended december 31, 2014, largely due to the gws acquisition. excluding activity associated with the acquired jci-gws business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 69.0% for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to 68.5% for the year ended december 31, 2014.
operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $40.2 million, or 7.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily driven by higher payroll-related costs (including bonuses) during the year ended december 31, 2015 as well as costs associated with the gws acquisition. additionally, we incurred $10.3 million of costs in connection with our cost-elimination project. these items were partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $78.2 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2015.
asia pacific revenue increased by $167.3 million, or 17.3%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. contributions from the gws acquisition during the year ended december 31, 2015 as well as our acquisition of our former affiliate in thailand in june 2014 drove the increase for the year ended december 31, 2015. the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue (excluding the impact of the gws acquisition, up 30.1%) and property management fees (up 21.3%), as well as improved sales, leasing and appraisal activity. the overall increase was largely muted by foreign currency translation, which had a $120.7 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the australian dollar and japanese yen when converting to u.s. dollars during the year ended december 31, 2015 versus the year ended december 31, 2014.
cost of services increased by $154.2 million, or 25.4%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, driven by higher costs associated with our property management and occupier outsourcing businesses, including the gws acquisition. also contributing to the variance was increased commission expense resulting from higher transaction revenue as well as $7.0 million of costs incurred during the year ended december 31, 2015 in connection with our cost-elimination project. these increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $72.7 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31, 2015. cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 67.1% for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 62.7% for the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily due to the gws acquisition. excluding activity associated with the acquired jci-gws business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 64.1% for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to 62.7% for the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily driven by our revenue mix, with outsourcing revenue, which has a lower margin, being a higher percentage of revenue than in the year ended december 31, 2014.
operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $8.6 million, or 3.2%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily driven by higher payroll-related costs (including bonuses) as well as $4.4 million of costs incurred during the year ended december 31, 2015 in connection with our cost-elimination project. the increase was also partly driven by costs associated with the gws acquisition. these increases were largely offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $28.8 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2015.
global investment management revenue decreased by $8.2 million, or 1.8%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily driven by foreign currency translation, which had a $38.5 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the british pound sterling and euro when converting to u.s. dollars during the year ended december 31, 2015 versus the year ended december 31, 2014. higher carried interest revenue was more than offset by lower asset management, disposition and acquisition fees during the year ended december 31, 2015.
operating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $27.0 million, or 7.2%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily driven by foreign currency translation, which had a $26.3 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2015.
a rollforward of our aum by product type for the year ended december 31, 2015 is as follows (dollars in billions):
funds          separate          securities            total accounts balance at january 1, 2015               $28.8             $37.0               $24.8            $90.6
market appreciation (depreciation)                          1.3                (0.3   )          1.0
development services revenue was relatively consistent at $65.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to $65.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014.
operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $17.1 million, or 17.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was primarily driven by higher bonuses during the year ended december 31, 2015 as a result of significantly improved operating performance due to property sales.
as of december 31, 2015, development projects in process totaled $6.7 billion, up $1.3 billion from the end of 2014, and the inventory of pipeline deals totaled $3.6 billion, down $0.4 billion from year-end 2014.
liquidity and capital resources we believe that we can satisfy our working capital and funding requirements with internally generated cash flow and, as necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. our expected capital requirements for
2017 include up to approximately $170 million of anticipated capital expenditures, net of tenant concessions. as of december 31, 2016, we had aggregate commitments of $31.6 million to fund future co-investments in our global investment management business, $25.5 million of which is expected to be funded in 2017. additionally, as of december 31, 2016, we are committed to fund $23.0 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our development services business, which we may be required to fund at any time. as of december 31, 2016, we had $2.8 billion of borrowings available under our $2.8 billion revolving credit facility.
we have historically relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital, capital expenditure and general investment requirements (including strategic in-fill acquisitions) and have not sought other external sources of financing to help fund these requirements. in the absence of extraordinary events or a large strategic acquisition, we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future, and at a minimum for the next 12 months. we may seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt instruments, as we have done in the past, with new debt instruments at interest rates, maturities and terms we deem attractive.
as noted above, we believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing. in the past, we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable. however, it is possible that we may not be able to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms, or at all, in the future if we decide to make any further significant acquisitions.
our long-term liquidity needs, other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases, are generally comprised of two elements. the first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our long-term indebtedness. we are unable to project with certainty whether our long-term cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our long-term debt when it comes due. if our cash flow is insufficient, then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates. we cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms, if at all.
the second long-term liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions. our acquisition structures often include deferred and/or contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, we had accrued $91.0 million and $79.7 million, respectively, of deferred purchase consideration, which was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report.
in addition, on october 27, 2016, we announced that our board of directors had authorized the company to repurchase up to an aggregate of $250 million of its shares of class a common stock over three years. the timing of the repurchase and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the companys common stock, general market and economic conditions and other factors. we intend to fund the repurchases, if any, with cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
historical cash flows operating activities net cash provided by operating activities totaled $450.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, a decrease of $201.6 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net payments to vendors and income taxes paid during the year ended december 31, 2016. these items were partially offset by higher commissions paid during the year ended december 31, 2015.
net cash provided by operating activities totaled $651.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, a decrease of $9.9 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher bonuses and commissions paid during the year ended december 31, 2015 as well as an increase in real estate held for development during the year ended december 31, 2015. these items were partially offset by lower net payments to vendors and lower income taxes paid during the year ended december 31, 2015 as well as improved collections of receivables and operating performance during the year ended december 31, 2015.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled $7.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, a decrease of $1.6 billion as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. this variance was primarily driven by a greater amount invested in acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2015, particularly the gws acquisition.
net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015, an increase of $1.5 billion as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. this variance was primarily driven by amounts paid for the acquisition of the global workplace solutions business during the year ended december 31, 2015.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities totaled $199.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $789.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. this variance was primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of $600.0 million of 4.875% senior notes in august 2015 as well as $378.8 million of higher net borrowings of term loans under our 2015 credit agreement during the year ended december 31, 2015. these collective borrowings during the year ended december 31, 2015, as well as cash on hand, were used to fund the gws acquisition, which closed on september 1, 2015.
net cash provided by financing activities totaled $789.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $232.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. this variance was primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of $600.0 million of 4.875% senior notes in august 2015 and lower net repayments under our revolving credit facility during the year ended december 31, 2015. also contributing to the increase was the establishment of $900.0 million of new senior term loan facilities under our 2015 credit agreement, partially offset by repayment of $645.6 million of senior term loans under our 2013 credit agreement, both of which occurred during the year ended december 31, 2015. the net proceeds from the issuance of 5.25% senior notes and the redemption of $350.0 million of 6.625% senior notes during the year ended december 31, 2014 partially reduced the overall cash used in financing activities during 2014.

$88.9 million. of this amount, we can reasonably estimate that $34.9 million will require cash settlement in less than one year and $3.9 million will require cash settlement in one to three years. we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions for the remaining $50.1 million.
(10)                                        represents outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs, which are included in other current and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at december 31, 2016 set forth in item 8 of this annual report. due to the nature of this item, payments could be due at any time upon the occurrence of certain events. accordingly, the entire balance has been reflected as expiring in less than one year.
indebtedness our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to pay the principal amount of our indebtedness and other obligations when due. in addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness. if we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.

executive overview we are one of the largest providers of cloud-based human capital management ("hcm") solutions - including payroll, talent management, human resources and benefits administration, and time and attendance management - to employers around the world. as a leader in this industry, we are focused on driving product innovation, enhancing our distribution and service capabilities, and assisting our clients with their hcm needs in the face of ever increasing regulatory complexity.
•   new business bookings grew 12% from the year ended june 30, 2015 ("fiscal 2015")
•   pre-tax margin increased 20 basis points to 19.2%; adjusted ebit margin increased 60 basis points to 19.5%
•   enhanced our capital structure by issuing $2 billion of senior notes
•   continued our shareholder friendly actions by returning $1.2 billion via share repurchases and over $900 million via dividends, which increased on a per-share basis for the 41st consecutive year
•   delivered nearly 10 million form 1095-cs to client employees to assist with the affordable care act ("aca") reporting requirements
during the year ended june 30, 2016 ("fiscal 2016"), we continued to focus on our global hcm strategy and our results reflect the strength of our underlying business model, our success in the market, and our focus on growth. this focus is evidenced by our investments in product innovation, service, and our sales force, as well as the disposition of the advanced md ("amd") business.
our focus on product innovation, the high demand for additional hcm solutions (including products that assist businesses in complying with the aca), investments in and productivity of our salesforce, and continued positive economic growth in the united states of america ("u.s."), led our sales force to deliver strong new business bookings during fiscal 2016. our sales force's ability to sell to new and existing clients as well as our implementation team's ability to implement new clients on our solutions and implement new services to existing clients drove solid revenue growth during fiscal 2016. in the second half of fiscal year 2016, we began to see a contribution to revenue growth from our aca compliance solutions, as our upfront investments in selling and implementation of these products in late fiscal 2015 and throughout fiscal 2016 began to translate into recurring revenue.
this revenue growth was apparent within both of our business segments during fiscal 2016 despite pressure on employer services revenues from foreign currency translation. revenue retention declined compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to elevated losses on our legacy client platforms. this metric continues to be a point of internal focus as we upgrade our clients from legacy platforms to our new modern cloud-based solutions and focus on improving the client experience. our revenue growth also benefited from the continued increase in our pays per control metric, which we measure as the number of employees on our clients' payrolls as measured on a same-store-sales basis utilizing a representative subset of payrolls ranging from small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of u.s. geographic regions.
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we incurred a $48 million charge for a broad-based workforce optimization effort undertaken during the period. additionally, in july 2016, we announced a multi-year service alignment initiative intended to align our client service operations with our platform simplification strategy. in connection with this service alignment initiative, we anticipate incurring pre-tax charges of $100 million to $125 million through the year ended june 30, 2018.
we have a strong business model with a high percentage of recurring revenues, good margins, the ability to generate consistent, healthy cash flows, strong client retention, and low capital expenditure requirements. our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at june 30, 2016, with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $3.2 billion. additionally, during fiscal 2016, we changed our capital structure via the issuance of $2 billion in senior notes, the proceeds of which we have begun to return to shareholders via share repurchases. the introduction of long-term debt to our capital structure and the anticipated share repurchases are intended to enhance total shareholder return over the longer term.
fiscal 2016 was another exciting and dynamic year that showcased our agility as we continued to adapt to the evolving needs of our clients and the changing regulatory environment within our hcm industry as evidenced by our ability to respond to the challenges presented by the aca.  we continue to be pleased with the success of our sales operations, our ability to continuously innovate and offer new and exciting products to our clients, and the ability of our service organization to adapt to these new services and strategic platforms.  exiting fiscal 2016, we believe that our efforts during the fiscal year, in conjunction with our service alignment initiative announced in july, positions us well as we head into fiscal 2017.

note 1. non-gaap measures within the tables above and below, we use the term "constant dollar basis" so that certain financial measures can be viewed without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of business performance. the financial results on a "constant dollar basis" are determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year. we believe "constant dollar basis" provides information that isolates the actual growth of our operations. our constant dollar results are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("u.s. gaap") and should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to the u.s. gaap measures presented.
the following table reconciles our reported results to adjusted results that exclude our provision for income taxes; certain interest amounts; the charges related to our workforce optimization effort; the gain on the sale of a building; and the gain on the sale of our amd business in fiscal 2016. we use certain adjusted results, among other measures, to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods. we believe that the exclusion of these items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations, against prior period, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations.  we believe that these adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance.  generally, the nature of these exclusions are for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations.  specifically, we have excluded the impact of certain interest expense (as a result of the issuance of our $2.0 billion fixed-rate notes in september 2015 - refer to note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information), and interest income from adjusted earnings from continuing operations before interest and income taxes ("adjusted ebit") and have also excluded certain interest expense and certain interest income in prior years for comparability.  however, we continue to include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model.  the amounts included as adjustments in the table below represent the interest income and interest expense that is not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as "all other interest expense" and "all other interest income." the charges related to our workforce optimization effort represent severance charges.  severance charges have been taken in the past and not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results. unlike severance charges in prior periods, these specific charges relate to a broad-based, company-wide workforce optimization effort. since adjusted ebit, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations, adjusted diluted earnings per share ("adjusted diluted eps") from continuing operations and adjusted ebit margin are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, provision for income taxes, net earnings from continuing operations and diluted eps from continuing operations and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

total revenues our revenues, as reported, increased 7% in fiscal 2016, despite two percentage points of combined pressure from foreign currency translation and the disposition of the amd business in september 2015, primarily due to new business started during the past twelve months from new business bookings growth. refer to "analysis of reportable segments" for additional discussion of the increases in revenue for both of our reportable segments, employer services and professional employer organization ("peo") services.
total revenues in fiscal 2016 include interest on funds held for clients of $377.3 million, as compared to $377.7 million in fiscal 2015.  the decrease in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, partially offset by the increase in our average client funds balances of 2.8% to $22,418.7 million in fiscal 2016.
total expenses our total expenses, as reported, increased 7% in fiscal 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year. the increase is primarily due to an increase in peo services pass-through costs as well as an increase in selling and implementation expenses to support our growth in new business bookings as we experienced continued demand for additional hcm solutions, including products that assist businesses in complying with the aca. total expenses also increased due to increased costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue, and an increase in severance expenses, primarily related to our workforce optimization effort. these increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.

systems development and programming costs, as reported, increased 1% in fiscal 2016, when compared to the same period in the prior year, due to increased investments and costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, partially offset by a higher proportion of capitalized costs of our strategic projects and the impact of foreign currency translation.
selling, general and administrative expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.  the increase was primarily related to an increase in selling expenses to support our growth in new business bookings as we experienced continued demand for our hcm products, particularly those that are designed to assist businesses in complying with the aca. selling, general and administrative expenses also increased due to $57.6 million of additional severance charges, of which $48.2 million relate to our workforce optimization effort, and a $10.7 million reversal of reserves in fiscal 2015 related to our former dealer services business financing arrangements which were sold to a third party. these increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.

provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 and 2015 was 33.2% and 33.5%, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to the usage of foreign tax credits in a repatriation of foreign earnings in fiscal 2016, partially offset by the resolution of certain tax matters in fiscal 2015.
adjusted provision for income taxes the effective tax rate, adjusted for the impact of the workforce optimization effort, sale of the amd business, and a gain on the sale of a building, for fiscal 2016 and 2015 was 33.3% and 33.5%, respectively. the decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was due to the usage of foreign tax credits in a repatriation of foreign earnings in fiscal 2016, partially offset by the resolution of certain tax matters during fiscal 2015.

earnings from continuing operations before income taxes earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 10% due to increases in revenue and expenses discussed above and includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of one percentage point. overall margin increased from 18.4% in fiscal 2014 to 18.9% in fiscal 2015. this increase was due to our operating costs related to servicing our clients increasing slower than our revenues, partially offset by the impact of higher selling expenses to support our new business bookings.
adjusted ebit adjusted ebit, which excludes certain interest amounts, increased 10% due to the increases in revenues and expenses discussed above. overall adjusted ebit margin increased to 18.8% in fiscal 2015 from 18.3% in fiscal 2014 due to our operating costs related to servicing our clients increasing slower than our revenues, partially offset by the impact of higher selling expenses to support our new business bookings.
provision for income taxes the effective tax rates in fiscal 2015 and 2014 were 33.5% and 33.9%, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to adjustments to the tax liability, the usage of foreign tax credits in a planned repatriation of foreign earnings, and a change in tax law during fiscal 2015, partially offset by the resolution of certain tax matters during fiscal 2014.
net earnings from continuing operations and diluted eps from continuing operations net earnings from continuing operations increased 11%, on higher earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and a lower effective tax rate as described above. net earnings from continuing operations growth was unfavorably impacted one percentage point by foreign currency translation in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014.

revenues employer services' revenues, as reported, increased 5% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, despite a negative impact of one percentage point from foreign currency translation. revenues increased due to new business started from new business bookings, the impact of price increases, and an increase in the number of employees on our clients' payrolls as our u.s. pays per control increased 2.5% in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.  these increases were partially offset by the impact of client losses and foreign currency translation. our worldwide client revenue retention rate for fiscal 2016 decreased 100 basis points to 90.5% as compared to our rate for fiscal 2015 primarily due to elevated losses on our legacy platforms.
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes employer services' earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.  the increase was due to increased revenues discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses of $221.9 million.  the increase in expenses is related to increased costs of servicing our clients, as well as increased selling and implementation expenses due to new business bookings and associated implementation costs, including an increase in costs related to assisting our clients with aca compliance. these increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.
employer services' overall margin increased from 30.5% to 31.1% for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. this increase is due to lower selling expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 as well as an increase of 30 basis points from foreign currency translation, partially offset by investments in implementation and operational resources to support our revenue growth.
revenues from continuing operations employer services' revenues from continuing operations increased 4% due to new business started during the year from new business bookings growth, an increase in the number of employees on our clients payrolls, and the impact of price increases. during fiscal 2015, employer services' revenue growth was negatively impacted two percentage points by unfavorable foreign currency translation. our worldwide client revenue retention rate remained at a record level of 91.4% in fiscal 2015 when compared to fiscal 2014 and our u.s. pays per control increased 3.0% in fiscal 2015.
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes employer services' earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 7% due to the increase in revenues from continuing operations of $377.5 million discussed above, partially offset by an increase in expenses of $205.7 million.  this growth includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of one percentage point. expenses increased in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, due to labor related costs to support our growing revenues and an increase in selling expenses as we experienced traction from our increased focus on product development, high demand for additional hcm solutions, including products that assist businesses in complying with the aca, improved productivity, and an improving economic backdrop in the u.s. overall margin increased approximately 60 basis points from 29.9% to 30.5% in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, due to our operating costs related to servicing our clients increasing at a slower rate than our revenues partially offset by an increase in selling expense due to higher new business bookings.
revenues peo services' revenues as reported increased 16% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. such revenues include pass-through costs of $2,336.3 million for fiscal 2016 and $2,015.9 million for fiscal 2015 associated with benefits coverage, workers' compensation coverage, and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees. the increase in revenues was due to a 13% increase in the average number of worksite employees, driven by an increase in the number of new peo services clients and growth in our existing clients, as well as higher client participation and higher benefit pass-through costs in our peo benefit offerings.
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes peo services' earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 23% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. the increase was due to increased revenues discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses of $357.0 million. this increase in expenses is primarily related to an increase in pass-through costs of $320.4 million described above. overall margin increased from 11.4% to 12.1% for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, due to operating efficiencies, as our operating costs related to servicing our clients increased slower than our revenues, and sales efficiencies.
revenues peo services' revenues increased 17% in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. such revenues include pass-through costs of $2,015.9 million for fiscal 2015 and $1,736.0 million for fiscal 2014 associated with benefits coverage, workers' compensation coverage, and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees.  the increase in revenues was due to a 14% increase in the average number of worksite employees, resulting from an increase in the number of new clients and growth in our existing clients.
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes peo services' earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 30% in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. the increase was due to increased revenues of $376.3 million discussed above, partially offset by an increase in expenses of $307.1 million. this increase in expenses is primarily related to the increase in pass-through costs of $279.9 million described above. overall margin increased from 10.3% to 11.4% for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, due to sales productivity and increased operating efficiencies, as our costs related to acquiring new business and servicing our clients increased slower than our revenues.
other the primary components of the "other" segment are the results of operations of adp indemnity, non-recurring gains and losses, miscellaneous processing services, the elimination of intercompany transactions, interest expense, certain charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as stock-based compensation expense, and beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the historical results of the amd business, which was previously reported in the employer services segment. this change, which is adjusted for both the current period and the prior period in the table above, did not significantly affect reportable segment results and is consistent with the way the chief operating decision maker assesses the performance of the reportable segments.
adp indemnity provides workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services' worksite employees up to $1 million per occurrence.  peo services has secured a workers' compensation and employer's liability insurance policy that has a $1 million per occurrence retention and, in fiscal years 2012 and prior, aggregate stop loss insurance that covers any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level, from an admitted and licensed insurance company of aig. we utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the peo services business.  premiums are charged by adp indemnity to peo services to cover the claims expected to be incurred by the peo services' worksite employees.  changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are recognized by adp indemnity.  for the fiscal years 2013 to 2017, adp indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ace american insurance company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of chubb limited ("chubb"), to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity during these policy years. each of these reinsurance arrangements limits our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit. we believe the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote. during fiscal 2016, adp indemnity paid a premium of $202.0 million to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the fiscal 2016 policy year up to $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services' worksite employees. adp indemnity paid a premium of $221.0 million in july 2016 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the year ended june 30, 2017 ("fiscal 2017") policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2016 reinsurance policy.
financial condition, liquidity and capital resources for corporate liquidity, we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, long-term marketable securities, and cash flow from operations together with our $9.25 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to access both long-term and short-term debt financing from the capital markets will be adequate to meet our operating, investing, and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividend, share repurchases, and capital expenditures.
for client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our u.s. short-term commercial paper program and our u.s. and canadian short-term reverse repurchase agreements together with our $9.25 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. please see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a further discussion of the risks of our client funds investment strategy. see note 7 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our short-term financing including commercial paper.
as of june 30, 2016, cash and short-term marketable securities were $3,214.6 million, which were primarily invested in time deposits, money market funds and asset-backed commercial paper.
operating, investing and financing cash flows our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the statements of consolidated cash flows for the years ended 2016, 2015, and 2014, are summarized as follows:
(in millions)                                                                                             years ended june 30,                                    $ change

net cash flows provided by operating activities decreased due to $226.7 million received from the sale of notes receivable related to dealer services financing arrangements during fiscal 2015.
net cash flows used in investing activities increased due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations of $5,257.6 million and the receipt of the cdk global, inc.("cdk") dividend during fiscal 2015, partially offset by the timing of purchases of and proceeds from corporate and client funds marketable securities of $545.7 million.
net cash flows provided by financing activities increased due to the net increase in client funds obligations of $2,728.9 million, as a result of the timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds, proceeds from our $2.0 billion september 2015 debt issuance, a decrease in our repurchases of common stock, and the timing of borrowings and repayments of commercial paper. we purchased approximately 13.8 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $82.88 during fiscal 2016 as compared to purchases of 18.2 million shares at an average price per share of $85.28 during fiscal 2015. from time to time, the company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs.  the company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.
net cash flows provided by operating activities increased due to $226.7 million received from the sale of notes receivable related to dealer services financing arrangements and a lower pension contribution of $74.8 million for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014.
net cash flows of investing activities changed due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations of $5,498.4 million, partially offset by the receipt of the cdk dividend during fiscal 2015.
net cash flows of financing activities changed due to the net increase in client funds obligations of $9,063.9 million, as a result of the timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds, partially offset by an increase in our repurchases of common stock and the timing of borrowings and repayments of commercial paper.
capital resources and client fund obligations in september 2015, we issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2020 and 2025. we may from time to time revisit the long-term debt market to refinance existing debt, finance investments including acquisitions for our growth, and maintain the appropriate capital structure. however, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all. see note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-term financing including this fiscal 2016 debt issuance.
our u.s. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. during the majority of fiscal 2016, this commercial paper program provided for the issuance of up to $8.25 billion in aggregate maturity value and in june 2016, we increased our commercial paper program to
$9.25 billion. our commercial paper program is rated a-1+ by standard and poor's and prime-1 by moody's. these ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days.  for fiscal 2016, our average daily borrowings were $2.7 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 0.3%. the weighted average maturity of the company's commercial paper during fiscal 2016 was approximately two days. at june 30, 2016 and 2015, we had no outstanding obligations under our short-term commercial paper program.
our u.s. and canadian short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. these agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days.  we have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. at june 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements. for fiscal 2016 and 2015, we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of $341.0 million and $421.2 million, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.4%. see note 4 of our consolidated financial statements for client fund investments used as collateral for reverse repurchase agreements.
we vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility. we have a $3.25 billion, 364-day credit agreement with a group of lenders that matures in june 2017 with a one year term-out option. in addition, we have a five-year $2.25 billion credit facility and a five-year $3.75 billion credit facility maturing in june 2020 and june 2021, respectively, each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. the primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary.  we had no borrowings through june 30, 2016 under the credit agreements. we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $9.25 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements. see note 7 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our short-term financing including credit facilities.
our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of sub-prime mortgages, alternative-a mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment grade fixed-income securities. we own aaa rated senior tranches of fixed rate credit card, auto loan, equipment lease, rate reduction, and other asset-backed securities, secured predominately by prime collateral.  all collateral on asset-backed securities is performing as expected.  in addition, we own senior debt directly issued by federal home loan banks and federal farm credit banks.  we do own mortgage-backed securities, which represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages.  these securities are collateralized by the cash flows of 15-year and 30-year residential mortgages and are guaranteed primarily by federal national mortgage association as to the timely payment of principal and interest.  our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).  this investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. see note 4 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients.
capital expenditures for continuing operations for fiscal 2016 were $165.7 million, as compared to $171.2 million for fiscal 2015. we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 to be about $250 million.
contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations with a future life of greater than one year at june 30, 2016.
operating lease and software license obligations (2)                               $106.2                 $185.0                 $99.1            $100.8                     $-                       $491.1
obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits (4)                                   $-                     $-                    $-            $-                         $27.4                     $27.4
other long-term liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets:
compensation and benefits (5)                                                        $3.5                 $231.2                $121.8            $262.7                     $91.4                    $710.6
(2)   included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements. we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment, as well as the licensing of software. the majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements.
(3)   purchase obligations are comprised of a $221.0 million reinsurance premium with chubb for the fiscal 2017 policy year, as well as obligations related to purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment, and other assets.
(4)   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the period in which cash payments related to unrecognized tax benefits are expected to be paid.
(5)   compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements. these amounts exclude the estimated contributions to our defined benefit plans, which are expected to be $11.0 million in fiscal 2017.
in addition to the obligations quantified in the table above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. as of june 30, 2016, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2017, total $33,331.8 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our consolidated balance sheets. we had $33,841.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that have been impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our consolidated balance sheets as of june 30, 2016.
separately, adp indemnity paid a premium of $221.0 million in july 2016 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the fiscal 2017 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2016 reinsurance policy. at june 30, 2016, adp indemnity had total assets of $456.2 million to satisfy the actuarially estimated unpaid losses of $416.5 million for the policy years since july 1, 2003. adp indemnity paid claims of $8.3 million and $26.0 million, net of insurance recoveries, in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. refer to the "analysis of reportable segments - other" above for additional information regarding adp indemnity.
in the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. we do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and long-term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees).
our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities.  these assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury and/or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes.  all of our short-term and long-term fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. consistent with those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income.  client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase, and money market securities and other cash equivalents.
we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.  our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).  as part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities.  we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client's obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the client's funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client's obligation.  as a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations.
there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets.  such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations.  however, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations.  we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $9.25 billion commercial paper program (rated a-1+ by standard and poor's and prime-1 ("p-1") by moody's, the highest possible credit ratings), ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreements and available borrowings under our $9.25 billion committed credit facilities. the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business.  in addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below.
we have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments.  the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate and canadian provincial bonds is bbb, for asset-backed securities is aaa, and for municipal bonds is a.  the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbb rated securities is 5 years, for single a rated securities is 7 years, and for aa rated and aaa rated securities is 10 years. time deposits and commercial paper must be rated a-1 and/or p-1. money market funds must be rated aaa/aaa-mf.

we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested.  factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments.  this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes.  the annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio declined to 1.6% for fiscal 2016, as compared to 1.7% for fiscal 2015.  a hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $13 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending june 30, 2017.  a hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $7 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending june 30, 2017.
we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities.  we limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily aaa and aa rated securities, as rated by moody's, standard & poor's, and for canadian securities, dbrs. approximately 80% of our available-for-sale securities held a aaa or aa rating at june 30, 2016.  in addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than u.s. and canadian government or government agency securities.
we operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. we experienced pressure from foreign currency translation on our revenue and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes in fiscal 2015 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2016. we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. we may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. we had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at june 30, 2016 or 2015.
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note 1, new accounting pronouncements, of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
revenue recognition. our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services (e.g., employer services' payroll processing fees), investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds and other employer services' client-related funds, and fees charged to implement clients on the company's solutions. we enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction (e.g., number of payees or number of payrolls processed). fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
peo provides a comprehensive human resources outsourcing solution, including offering benefits, providing workers' compensation insurance, and administering state unemployment insurance, among other human resources functions. amounts collected from peo worksite employers include payroll, fees for benefits, and an administrative fee that also includes payroll taxes, fees for workers' compensation and state unemployment taxes.
the payroll and payroll taxes collected from the worksite employers is presented in revenue net, as the company is not the primary obligor with respect to this aspect of the peo arrangement. with respect to the payroll and payroll taxes, the worksite employer is the primary obligor, has latitude in establishing price, selects suppliers, and determines the service specifications.
the fees collected from the worksite employers for benefits, workers' compensation and state unemployment taxes are presented in revenues and the associated costs of benefits, workers' compensation and state unemployment taxes are included in operating expenses, as the company acts as a principal with respect to this aspect of the arrangement. with respect to the fees for benefits, workers' compensation and state unemployment taxes, the company is the primary obligor, has latitude in establishing price, selects suppliers, determines the service specifications and is liable for credit risk.
we recognize interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services.
we assess the collectability of revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer's payment history.
goodwill. we account for goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification ("asc") 350, "intangibles - goodwill and other," which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. according to asc 350, we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit's goodwill for impairment or can directly perform the two-step impairment test. based on a qualitative assessment, if it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test prescribed by asc 350 would be performed.
our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of june 30, 2016 was performed using a qualitative approach. the qualitative assessment considered industry and market considerations for any deterioration in the environment in which we operate, the competitive environment, a decline (both absolute and relative to peers) in market-dependent multiples or metrics, any changes in the market for our services, and regulatory and political development. additionally, we assessed financial
performance by reporting unit and considered cost factors, such as labor or other costs, that would have a negative effect on results. the annual goodwill impairment assessments performed for fiscal 2016 have indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is substantially in excess of carrying value and not at risk of failing step one of the quantitative goodwill impairment test. based on our qualitative assessment, the company has determined that goodwill is not impaired.
income taxes. the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service ("irs") and other tax authorities. a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
there is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. specifically, the likelihood of an entity's tax benefits being sustained must be "more likely than not" assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements. if a tax position drops below the "more likely than not" standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the "more likely than not" standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes. a change in the assessment of the "more likely than not" standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. as of june 30, 2016 and 2015, the company's liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $27.4 million and $27.1 million, respectively.
if certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. based on current estimates, favorable settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to $2 million in the next twelve months. audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
stock-based compensation. we measure stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. the binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and employee exercise behavior. expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price, and other factors. similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. the risk-free rate is derived from the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. the binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. determining these assumptions is subjective and complex, and, therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
reference is made to "part i. item 1a. risk factors" and "cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements," which describe important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and non-historical information contained herein. in addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto of charter communications, inc. and subsidiaries included in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
overview we are the second largest cable operator in the united states and a leading broadband communications services company providing video, internet and voice services to approximately 26.2 million residential and business customers at december 31, 2016. in addition, we sell video and online advertising inventory to local, regional and national advertising customers and fiber-delivered communications and managed it solutions to larger enterprise customers. we also own and operate regional sports networks and local sports, news and community channels and sell security and home management services to the residential marketplace. see
"part i. item 1. business - products and services" for further description of these services, including customer statistics for different services.
since 2012, legacy charter has actively invested in its network and operations and improved the quality and value of the products and packages that legacy charter offered. through the roll-out of spectrum pricing and packaging we have simplified our offers and improved our packaging of products, delivering more value to new and existing customers. further, through the transition of our legacy charter markets to our all-digital platform, we increased our offerings to more than 200 hd channels in most of the legacy charter markets and offered internet speeds of at least 60 or 100 mbps, among other benefits. we believe that this product set combined with improved customer service, as we insource our workforce in our call centers and in our field operations, has led to lower customer churn and longer customer lifetimes.
as a result of the transactions, 2016 revenues increased by over $18.6 billion year over year. we also saw an increase in expenses related to our increased scale. in september 2016, we began launching spp to legacy twc markets and we expect that by mid 2017, we will offer spp in all legacy twc and legacy bright house markets. in 2017, we intend to begin converting the remaining legacy twc and legacy bright house analog markets to an all-digital platform. our corporate organization, as well as our marketing, sales and product development departments, are now centralized. field operations are managed through eleven regional areas, each designed to represent a combination of designated marketing areas and managed with largely the same set of field employees that were with the three legacy companies prior to completion of the transactions. over a multi-year period, legacy twc and legacy bright house customer care centers will migrate to legacy charter's model of using segmented, virtualized, u.s.-based in-house call centers. we will focus on deploying superior products and service with minimal service disruptions as we integrate our information technology and network operations. we expect customer and financial results to trend similar to legacy charter following the implementation of the legacy charter operating strategies across the legacy twc and legacy bright house markets. as a result of implementing our operating strategy at legacy twc and legacy bright house, we cannot be certain that we will be able to grow revenues or maintain our margins at recent historical rates.
the company realized revenue, adjusted ebitda and income from operations during the periods presented as follows (in millions; all percentages are calculated using whole numbers. minor differences may exist due to rounding).
adjusted ebitda            $10,592                $3,406                $3,190               211.0         %            6.8         %
adjusted ebitda            $14,464               $13,004                                      11.2         %
adjusted ebitda is defined as consolidated net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on financial instruments, net, other (income) expense, net and other operating (income) expenses, such as merger and restructuring costs, other pension benefits, special charges and gain (loss) on sale or retirement of assets. see "-use of adjusted ebitda and free cash flow" for further information on adjusted ebitda and free cash flow.  growth in total revenue, adjusted ebitda and income from operations was primarily due to the transactions.
on a pro forma basis, assuming the transactions occurred as of january 1, 2015, total revenue growth was primarily due to growth in our internet and commercial businesses. on a pro forma basis, adjusted ebitda growth was primarily due to an increase in residential and commercial revenues offset by increases in programming costs and other operating costs. in addition to the factors discussed above, income from operations on a pro forma basis was affected by increases in depreciation and amortization, merger and restructuring costs and stock compensation expense.
certain commercial customers. the remaining 10%, 9% and 10% of revenue for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is derived primarily from advertising revenues, franchise and other regulatory fee revenues (which are collected by us but then paid to local authorities), pay-per-view and vod programming, installation, processing fees or reconnection fees charged to customers to commence or reinstate service, and commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping services.
we incurred the following transition costs in connection with the transactions (in millions).
capital expenditures          $460                $115                 $27
amounts included in transition operating expenses and transition capital expenditures represent incremental costs incurred to integrate the legacy twc and legacy bright house operations and to bring the three companies' systems and processes into a uniform operating structure.  costs are incremental and would not be incurred absent the integration.  other operating expenses associated with the transactions represent merger and restructuring costs and include advisory, legal and accounting fees, employee retention costs, employee termination costs and other exit costs.  interest expense associated with the transactions represents interest incurred on the cco safari ii, cco safari iii and ccoh safari notes issued in advance of the closing of the transactions, the proceeds of which were held in escrow to finance the transactions.
we have a history of net losses.  our net losses were principally attributable to insufficient revenue to cover the combination of operating expenses, interest expenses that we incur on our debt, depreciation expenses resulting from the capital investments we have made, and continue to make, in our cable properties, amortization expenses related to our customer relationship intangibles and higher non-cash income tax expense. we will incur significant increases in interest expense and depreciation and amortization as a result of the transactions and will incur restructuring and transition costs for at least one to two years, and as a result, absent non-recurring impacts such as the reversal of the income tax valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2016, we may incur net losses in the future.
critical accounting policies and estimates certain of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments. management has discussed these policies with the audit committee of charter's board of directors, and the audit committee has reviewed the following disclosure. we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the estimates, assumptions and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements, and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows:
•   capitalization of labor and overhead costs
•   litigation
•   pension plans in addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimates or judgment that are not deemed critical, such as the allowance for doubtful accounts and valuations of our financial instruments, but changes in estimates or judgment in these other items could also have a material impact on our financial statements.
property, plant and equipment the cable industry is capital intensive, and a large portion of our resources are spent on capital activities associated with extending, rebuilding, and upgrading our cable network. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the net carrying amount of our property, plant and equipment (consisting primarily of cable distribution systems) was approximately $33.0 billion (representing 22% of total assets) and $8.3 billion (representing 49% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively. total capital expenditures for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $5.3 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.
capitalization of labor and overhead costs. costs associated with network construction, initial placement of the customer drop to the dwelling and the initial placement of outlets within a dwelling along with the costs associated with the initial deployment of customer premise equipment necessary to provide video, internet or voices services, are capitalized.  costs capitalized include materials, direct labor, and certain indirect costs. these indirect costs are associated with the activities of personnel who assist in installation activities, and consist of compensation and overhead costs associated with these support functions.  while our capitalization is based on specific activities, once capitalized, we track these costs on a composite basis by fixed asset category at the cable system level, and not on a specific asset basis.  for assets that are sold or retired, we remove the estimated applicable cost and accumulated depreciation.  the costs of disconnecting service and removing customer premise equipment from a dwelling and the costs to reconnect a customer drop or to redeploy previously installed customer premise equipment are charged to operating expensed as incurred. costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred, while plant and equipment replacement, including replacement of certain components, betterments, and replacement of cable drops and outlets, are capitalized.
we make judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be capitalized. we capitalize direct labor and overhead using standards developed from actual costs and applicable operational data. we calculate standards annually (or more frequently if circumstances dictate) for items such as the labor rates, overhead rates, and the actual amount of time required to perform a capitalizable activity. for example, the standard amounts of time required to perform capitalizable activities are based on studies of the time required to perform such activities. overhead rates are established based on an analysis of the nature of costs incurred in support of capitalizable activities, and a determination of the portion of costs that is directly attributable to capitalizable activities. the impact of changes that resulted from these studies were not material in the periods presented.
labor costs directly associated with capital projects are capitalized. capitalizable activities performed in connection with installations include such activities as:
•   verification of serviceability to the customer's dwelling or business (i.e., determining whether the customer's dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network and/or receiving advanced or internet services);
•   customer premise activities performed by in-house field technicians and third-party contractors in connection with customer installations, installation of equipment in connection with the installation of video, internet or voice services, and equipment replacement and betterment; and
•   verifying the integrity of the customer's network connection by initiating test signals downstream from the headend to the customer's digital set-top box, as well as testing signal levels at the pole or pedestal.
judgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead costs incurred result from specific capital activities, and therefore should be capitalized. the primary costs that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are (i) employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct labor, (ii) direct variable costs associated with capitalizable activities, (iii) the cost of support personnel, such as care personnel and dispatchers, who assist with capitalizable installation activities, and (iv) indirect costs directly attributable to capitalizable activities.
while we believe our existing capitalization policies are appropriate, a significant change in the nature or extent of our system activities could affect management's judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future. we monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policies, and perform updates to our internal studies on an ongoing basis to determine whether facts or circumstances warrant a change to our capitalization policies. we capitalized direct labor and overhead of $991 million, $420 million and $427 million, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
valuation and impairment of property, plant and equipment. we evaluate the recoverability of our property, plant and equipment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. such events or changes in circumstances could include such factors as the impairment of our indefinite life franchises, changes in technological advances, fluctuations in the fair value of such assets, adverse changes in relationships with local franchise authorities, adverse changes in market conditions, or a deterioration of current or expected future operating results. a long-lived
asset is deemed impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset. no impairments of long-lived assets to be held and used were recorded in the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
we utilize the cost approach as the primary method used to establish fair value for our property, plant and equipment in connection with business combinations.  the cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing a new asset with similar utility, then adjusts the value in consideration of physical depreciation and functional and economic obsolescence as of the appraisal date. the cost approach relies on management's assumptions regarding current material and labor costs required to rebuild and repurchase significant components of our property, plant and equipment along with assumptions regarding the age and estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.
depreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment totaled $5.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing approximately 19%, 21% and 22% of costs and expenses, respectively. depreciation is recorded using the straight-line composite method over management's estimate of the useful lives of the related assets as listed below:
cable distribution systems                      7-20 years customer premise equipment and installations     3-8 years vehicles and equipment                           3-6 years buildings and improvements                     15-40 years furniture, fixtures and equipment               6-10 years intangible assets valuation and impairment of franchises. the net carrying value of franchises as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $67.3 billion (representing 45% of total assets) and $6.0 billion (representing 35% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively. for more information and a complete discussion of how we value and test franchise assets for impairment, see note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
we perform an impairment assessment of franchise assets annually or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances. we performed a qualitative assessment in 2016. our assessment included consideration of the fair value appraisals of legacy charter and the newly-acquired operations performed as of the date of acquisition for tax and acquisition accounting purposes, respectively, along with a multitude of factors that affect the fair value of our franchise assets. examples of such factors include environmental and competitive changes within our operating footprint, actual and projected operating performance, the consistency of our operating margins, equity and debt market trends, including changes in our market capitalization, and changes in our regulatory and political landscape, among other factors. based on our assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our franchise assets equals or exceeds their carrying values and that a quantitative impairment test is not required.
the appraisals indicated that the fair value of our franchise assets exceeded carrying value by approximately 25% in the aggregate, with the excess entirely attributable to the franchise assets of legacy charter to which acquisition accounting was not applied. at our unit of accounting level for franchise asset impairment testing, the amount by which fair value exceeds carrying value varies based on the extent to which the unit of accounting was comprised of newly-acquired operations. for units of accounting comprised entirely or substantially of newly-acquired operations, we believe the carrying value approximates the fair value given that there has been no significant adverse changes in factors impacting our fair value estimates since the transaction date. for units of accounting comprised of at least 25% legacy charter operations, the fair value exceeded carrying value by a range of 36% to 260%.
valuation and impairment of goodwill. the net carrying value of goodwill as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $29.5 billion (representing 20% of total assets) and $1.2 billion (representing 7% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively. for more information and a complete discussion on how we test goodwill for impairment, see note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data." we perform our impairment assessment of goodwill annually as of november 30th. as with our franchise impairment testing, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill in 2016 which included the fair value appraisals and other factors described above. based on the appraisals, we determined that the fair value of our goodwill exceeded carrying value by approximately 28% as of the closing of the transactions. given the limited amount of time between the closing of the transactions and the completion of the assessment and absence of significant adverse changes in factors impacting our fair value estimates, we concluded that it is more likely than not that our goodwill is not impaired.
valuation, impairment and amortization of customer relationships. the net carrying value of customer relationships as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $14.6 billion (representing 10% of total assets) and $856 million (representing 5% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively. amortization expense related to customer relationships for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $1.9 billion, $249 million and $282 million, respectively. no impairment of customer relationships was recorded in the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. for more information and a complete discussion on our valuation methodology and amortization method, see note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
income taxes as of december 31, 2016, charter had approximately $11.2 billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset of approximately $3.9 billion. these losses resulted from the operations of charter holdco and its subsidiaries and from loss carryforwards received as a result of the twc transaction. federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2018 through 2035. in addition, as of december 31, 2016, charter had state tax net operating loss carryforwards, resulting in a gross deferred tax asset (net of federal tax benefit) of approximately $304 million. state tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the years 2017 through 2035.  such tax loss carryforwards can accumulate and be used to offset charter's future taxable income. as of december 31, 2016, all of charter's federal tax loss carryforwards are subject to section 382 and other restrictions. pursuant to these restrictions, charter estimates that approximately $5.4 billion in 2017, $3.8 billion in 2018, $432 million in 2019 and an additional $226 million annually over each of the next five years of federal tax loss carryforwards, should become unrestricted and available for charter's use. an additional $415 million is currently subject to a valuation allowance. charter's state tax loss carryforwards are subject to similar but varying restrictions.
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management takes into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. due to legacy charter's history of losses, legacy charter was historically unable to assume future taxable income in its analysis and accordingly valuation allowances were established against the deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, from definite-lived assets for book accounting purposes. however, as a result of the twc transaction, deferred tax liabilities resulting from the book fair value adjustment increased significantly and future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities are recognized, is sufficient to conclude it is more likely than not that we will realize substantially all of our deferred tax assets. as a result, charter has reversed approximately $3.3 billion of its valuation allowance and recognized a corresponding income tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31, 2016. approximately $145 million of valuation allowance associated with federal tax net operating loss carryforwards and approximately $55 million of valuation allowance associated with state tax loss carryforwards and other miscellaneous deferred tax assets remains on the december 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet.
in determining our tax provision for financial reporting purposes, charter establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless such positions are determined to be "more likely than not" of being sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits. in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements. the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved. there is considerable judgment involved in determining whether positions taken on the tax return are "more likely than not" of being sustained. charter adjusts its uncertain tax reserve estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations.
no tax years for charter, charter holdings or charter holdco, for income tax purposes, are currently under examination by the irs. charter and charter holdings' 2016 tax year remains open for assessment. legacy charter's tax years ending 2013 through the short period return dated may 17, 2016 remain subject to examination and assessment. years prior to 2013 remain open solely for purposes of examination of legacy charter's loss and credit carryforwards. the irs is currently examining legacy twc's income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. legacy twc's tax years ending 2013 through 2015 remain subject to examination and assessment. prior to legacy twc's separation from time warner inc. ("time warner") in march 2009 (the "separation"), legacy twc was included in the consolidated u.s. federal and certain state income tax returns of time warner. the irs is currently examining time warner's 2008 through 2010 income tax returns. time warner's income tax returns for 2005 to 2007, which are periods prior to the separation, were settled with the exception of an immaterial item that has been referred to the irs appeals division. we have unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest and penalties, totaling approximately $172 million and $5 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
litigation legal contingencies have a high degree of uncertainty. when a loss from a contingency becomes estimable and probable, a reserve is established. the reserve reflects management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised as facts and circumstances change. a reserve is released when a matter is ultimately brought to closure or the statute of limitations lapses. we have established reserves for certain matters. although these matters are not expected individually to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, such matters could have, in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
programming agreements we exercise significant judgment in estimating programming expense associated with certain video programming contracts. our policy is to record video programming costs based on our contractual agreements with our programming vendors, which are generally multi-year agreements that provide for us to make payments to the programming vendors at agreed upon market rates based on the number of customers to which we provide the programming service. if a programming contract expires prior to the parties' entry into a new agreement and we continue to distribute the service, we estimate the programming costs during the period there is no contract in place. in doing so, we consider the previous contractual rates, inflation and the status of the negotiations in determining our estimates. when the programming contract terms are finalized, an adjustment to programming expense is recorded, if necessary, to reflect the terms of the new contract. we also make estimates in the recognition of programming expense related to other items, such as the accounting for free periods, timing of rate increases and credits from service interruptions, as well as the allocation of consideration exchanged between the parties in multiple-element transactions.
significant judgment is also involved when we enter into agreements that result in us receiving cash consideration from the programming vendor, usually in the form of advertising sales, channel positioning fees, launch support or marketing support. in these situations, we must determine based upon facts and circumstances if such cash consideration should be recorded as revenue, a reduction in programming expense or a reduction in another expense category (e.g., marketing).
pension plans upon completion of the twc transaction, we assumed legacy twc's pension plans. we sponsor two qualified defined benefit pension plans, the twc pension plan and the twc union pension plan (collectively, the "twc pension plans"), that provide pension benefits to a majority of legacy twc employees. we also provide a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain employees under the twc excess pension plan. as of december 31, 2016, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the twc pension plans was $3.3 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, and the net underfunded liability of the twc pension plans was recorded as a $1 million noncurrent asset, $6 million current liability and $309 million long-term liability.
pension benefits are based on formulas that reflect the employees' years of service and compensation during their employment period. actuarial gains or losses are changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from changes in assumptions. we have elected to follow a mark-to-market pension accounting policy for recording the actuarial gains or losses annually during the fourth quarter, or earlier if a remeasurement event occurs during an interim period. we use a december 31 measurement date for our pension plans.
we recognized a net periodic pension benefit of $813 million in 2016. net periodic pension benefit or expense is determined using certain assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate and expected rate of compensation increases. we determined the discount rate used to compute pension expense based on the yield of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds with cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future defined benefit payments. in developing the expected long-term rate of return on assets, we considered the current pension portfolio's composition, past
average rate of earnings, and our asset allocation targets. we used a discount rate of 3.99% from the date of the transaction to june 30, 2016, and 3.72% from july 1, 2016 to december 31, 2016 to compute 2016 pension expense. a decrease in the discount rate of 25 basis points would result in a $154 million increase in our pension plan benefit obligation as of december 31, 2016 and net periodic pension expense recognized in 2016 under our mark-to-market accounting policy. our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to compute 2016 pension expense was 6.50%. a decrease in the expected long-term rate of return of 25 basis points, from 6.50% to 6.25%, while holding all other assumptions constant, would result in an increase in our 2017 net periodic pension expense of approximately $7 million. see note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" for additional discussion on these assumptions.
operating costs and expenses (exclusive of items shown separately below)          18,655                     6,426                     5,973
income tax benefit (expense)                                                       2,925                        60                      (236    )
video revenues consist primarily of revenues from basic and digital video services provided to our residential customers, as well as franchise fees, equipment rental and video installation revenue. excluding the impacts of the transactions, residential video customers increased by 42,000 in 2016 and decreased by 2,000 in 2015. the increases in video revenues are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):
advertising sales revenues consist primarily of revenues from commercial advertising customers, programmers and other vendors, as well as local cable and advertising on regional sports and news channels. advertising sales revenues increased in 2016 primarily due to the transactions and decreased in 2015 primarily as a result of a decrease in political advertising. the transactions increased advertising sales revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 by $898 million. on a pro forma basis, assuming the transactions occurred as of january 1, 2015, advertising sales revenues increased $172 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in political advertising.
regulatory, connectivity and produced content                  1,032                                 7
transition costs                                84                                                  58
on a pro forma basis, assuming the transactions occurred as of january 1, 2015, increases in our operating costs and expenses, exclusive of items shown separately in the consolidated statements of operations, are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):
regulatory, connectivity and produced content                  28
transition costs                                               84
programming costs consist primarily of costs paid to programmers for basic, digital, premium, vod, and pay-per-view programming. the increase in pro forma programming costs is primarily a result of annual contractual rate adjustments, including increases in amounts paid for retransmission consents and the introduction of new networks offset by synergies as a result of the transactions and lower pay-per-view programming expenses.  we expect pro forma programming expenses will continue to increase due to a variety of factors, including annual increases imposed by programmers with additional selling power as a result of media consolidation, increased demands by owners of broadcast stations for payment for retransmission consent or linking carriage of other services to retransmission consent, and additional programming, particularly new services. we have been unable to fully pass these increases on to our customers nor do we expect to be able to do so in the future without a potential loss of customers.
the increase in advertising sales expense relates primarily to higher advertising sales revenue. the increase in corporate costs relates primarily to increases in the number of employees including increases in engineering and it. stock compensation expense increased primarily due to increases in headcount and the value of equity issued.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization expense increased by $4.8 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of additional depreciation and amortization related to the transactions, inclusive of the incremental amounts as a result of the higher fair values recorded in acquisition accounting. depreciation and amortization expense increased by $23 million in 2015 compared to 2014 which primarily represents depreciation on more recent capital expenditures offset by certain assets becoming fully depreciated.
other pension benefits                               (899         )                      -
the increase in merger and restructuring costs is primarily due to approximately $262 million of legacy charter and legacy twc contingent financing and advisory transaction fees paid at the closing of the transactions as well as approximately $642 million of employee retention and employee termination costs incurred during 2016. other pension benefits includes the pension curtailment gain of $675 million, remeasurement gain of $195 million, expected return on plan assets of $116 million offset by interest costs of $87 million. for more information, see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
interest expense, net.  net interest expense increased by $1.2 billion in 2016 from 2015 and by $395 million in 2015 from 2014 primarily as a result of an increase of $463 million and $446 million, respectively, of interest expense associated with the debt incurred to fund the transactions, and, in 2016, $604 million associated with debt assumed from legacy twc.
loss on extinguishment of debt. loss on extinguishment of debt of $111 million and $128 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 primarily represents losses recognized as a result of the repurchase of cco holdings notes. for more information, see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
gain (loss) on financial instruments, net. interest rate derivative instruments are used to manage our interest costs and to reduce our exposure to increases in floating interest rates, and cross-currency derivative instruments are used to manage foreign exchange risk related to the foreign currency denominated debt assumed in the twc transaction. we recorded gains of $89 million and losses of $4 million and $7 million during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. gains and losses on financial instruments are recognized due to changes in the fair value of our interest rate and, in 2016 our cross currency derivative instruments and the remeasurement of the fixed-rate british pound sterling denominated notes (the "sterling notes") into u.s. dollars. the year ended december 31, 2016 also includes an $11 million loss realized upon termination of legacy twc interest rate swap derivative instruments. for more information, see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
other expense, net. other expense, net primarily represents equity losses on our equity-method investments. for more information, see note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
income tax benefit (expense). we recognized income tax benefits of $2.9 billion and $60 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and income tax expense of $236 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. certain of the deferred tax liabilities that were assumed in connection with the closing of the twc transaction will reverse and provide a source of future taxable income, resulting in a reduction of approximately $3.3 billion of legacy charter's preexisting valuation allowance associated with its deferred tax assets. such release of legacy charter's valuation allowance was recognized directly to income tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31, 2016. income tax benefit for the year ended december 31, 2016 was also impacted by a change in a state tax law that resulted in approximately $65 million of tax benefit. the tax provision in future periods will vary based on current and future temporary differences, as well as future operating results. for more information, see note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
the income tax benefit in 2015 was primarily due to the deemed liquidation of charter holdco solely for federal and state income tax purposes, resulting in a $187 million deferred income tax benefit offset by income tax expense primarily through increases in deferred tax liabilities. income tax expense was recognized in 2015 and 2014 primarily through increases in deferred tax liabilities related to legacy charter's franchises, which are characterized as indefinite lived for book financial reporting purposes, as well as, to a lesser extent, through current federal and state income tax expense.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for financial reporting purposes represents a/n's portion of charter holdings' net income based on its effective common unit ownership interest of approximately 10% and on the preferred dividend of $93 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. for more information, see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "item 1. financial statements."
use of adjusted ebitda and free cash flow we use certain measures that are not defined by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") to evaluate various aspects of our business. adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are non-gaap financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, consolidated net income (loss) and net cash flows from operating activities reported in accordance with gaap. these terms, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are reconciled to consolidated net income (loss) and net cash flows from operating activities, respectively, below.
adjusted ebitda is defined as consolidated net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on financial instruments, other (income) expense, net and other operating (income) expenses, such as merger and restructuring costs, other pension benefits, special charge
s and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. as such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of our businesses as well as other non-cash or special items, and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. however, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and our cash cost of financing. these costs are evaluated through other financial measures.
free cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures.
we believe that adjusted ebitda and free cash flow provide information useful to investors in assessing our performance and our ability to service our debt, fund operations and make additional investments with internally generated funds. in addition, adjusted ebitda generally correlates to the leverage ratio calculation under our credit facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the facilities and notes (all such documents have been previously filed with the sec). for the purpose of calculating compliance with leverage covenants, we use adjusted ebitda, as presented, excluding certain expenses paid by our operating subsidiaries to other charter entities. our debt covenants refer to these expenses as management fees, which fees were in the amount of $930 million, $322 million and $253 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

liquidity and capital resources overview we have significant amounts of debt.  the principal amount of our debt as of december 31, 2016 was $60.0 billion, consisting of $8.9 billion of credit facility debt, $37.7 billion of investment grade senior secured notes and $13.4 billion of high-yield senior unsecured notes. our business requires significant cash to fund principal and interest payments on our debt.
our projected cash needs and projected sources of liquidity depend upon, among other things, our actual results, and the timing and amount of our expenditures. free cash flow was $3.3 billion, $547 million and $171 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. as of december 31, 2016, the amount available under our credit facilities was approximately $2.8 billion and cash on hand was approximately $1.5 billion. we expect to utilize free cash flow, cash on hand and availability under our credit facilities as well as future refinancing transactions to further extend the maturities of or reduce the principal on our obligations. the timing and terms of any refinancing transactions will be subject to market conditions. additionally, we may, from time to time, and depending on market conditions and other factors, use cash on hand and the proceeds from securities offerings or other borrowings to retire our debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, tender offers or redemption provisions. we believe we have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand, free cash flow and charter operating's revolving credit facility as well as access to the capital markets to fund our projected cash needs.
we continue to evaluate the deployment of our cash on hand and anticipated future free cash flow including to invest in our business growth and other strategic opportunities, including mergers and acquisitions as well as stock repurchases and dividends. our target leverage remains at 4 to 4.5 times, and up to 3.5 times at the charter operating level. in 2016, charter purchased approximately 5.1 million shares of its class a common stock for approximately $1.3 billion pursuant to authorizations by charter's board of directors of $3 billion. accordingly, as of december 31, 2016 and provided charter's and charter operating's leverage ratios remain at target, management has authority to cause charter to purchase an additional $1.7 billion of charter's class a common stock without taking into account shares or units that may be purchased from a/n. effective november 1, 2016, charter's board of directors granted authority for a new $750 million of class a common stock buybacks under the rolling six-month authority without taking into account any class a common stock purchased prior to november 1. as a result, a portion of the $1.7 billion of authority is under the authority of management to approve up to $750 million for class a common stock buybacks in any six-month period. charter is not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the timing of any purchases that may occur cannot be predicted and will largely depend on market conditions and other potential uses of capital. purchases may include open market purchases or negotiated transactions. as possible acquisitions, swaps or dispositions arise, we actively review them against our objectives including, among other considerations, improving the operational efficiency, clustering, product development or technology capabilities of our business and achieving appropriate return targets, and we may participate to the extent we believe these possibilities present attractive opportunities. however, there can be no assurance that we will actually complete any acquisitions, dispositions or system swaps, or that any such transactions will be material to our operations or results.
in december 2016, charter and a/n exchanged 1.9 million charter holdings common units held by a/n for shares of charter class a common stock pursuant to the letter agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $537 million. the letter agreement also requires a/n to sell to charter or to charter holdings, on a monthly basis, a number of shares of charter class a common stock or charter holdings common units that represents a pro rata participation by a/n and its affiliates in any repurchases of shares of charter class a common stock from persons other than a/n effected by charter during the immediately preceding calendar month, at a purchase price equal to the average price paid by charter for the shares repurchased from persons other than a/n during such immediately preceding calendar month. pursuant to the letter agreement, charter holdings purchased from a/n 752,767 charter holdings common units at a price per unit of $289.83, or $218 million.
recent events in january 2017, charter operating entered into an amendment to its credit agreement decreasing the applicable libor margin on both the term loan e and term loan f to 2.00% and eliminating the libor floor.
in february 2017, cco holdings and cco holdings capital corp. closed on transactions in which they issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due 2027. the net proceeds will be used to redeem cco holdings' 6.625% senior notes due 2022, pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.

(a)   the table presents maturities of long-term debt outstanding as of december 31, 2016. refer to notes 9 and 20 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" for a description of our long-term debt and other contractual obligations and commitments.
(c)   we lease certain facilities and equipment under noncancelable capital and operating leases. leases and rental costs charged to expense for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, were $215 million, $49 million and $43 million, respectively.
(d)   we pay programming fees under multi-year contracts typically based on a flat fee per customer, which may be fixed for the term, or may in some cases escalate over the term. programming costs included in the accompanying statement of operations were approximately $7.0 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.5 billion, for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. certain of our programming agreements are based on a flat fee per month or have guaranteed minimum payments. the table sets forth the aggregate guaranteed minimum commitments under our programming contracts.
(e)   "other" represents other guaranteed minimum commitments, including rights negotiated directly with content owners for distribution on company-owned channels or networks and commitments related to our role as an advertising and distribution sales agent for third party-owned channels or networks as well as commitments to our customer premise equipment vendors.
the following items are not included in the contractual obligations table because the obligations are not fixed and/or determinable due to various factors discussed below. however, we incur these costs as part of our operations:
•   we rent utility poles used in our operations. generally, pole rentals are cancelable on short notice, but we anticipate that such rentals will recur. rent expense incurred for pole rental attachments for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $115 million, $53 million and $49 million, respectively.
•   we also have $278 million in letters of credit, of which $220 million is secured under the charter operating credit facility, primarily to our various casualty carriers as collateral for reimbursement of workers' compensation, auto liability and general liability claims.
•   minimum pension funding requirements have not been presented in the table above as such amounts have not been determined beyond 2016. we made no cash contributions to the qualified pension plans in 2016; however, we are permitted to make discretionary cash contributions to the qualified pension plans in 2017. for the nonqualified pension plan, we contributed $5 million during 2016 and will continue to make contributions in 2017 to the extent benefits are paid.
see "part i. item 1. business - transaction-related commitments" for a listing of commitments as a result of the transactions.
historical operating, investing, and financing activities cash and cash equivalents. we held $1.5 billion and $5 million in cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we also held $22.3 billion in restricted cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2015 representing proceeds of debt raised to fund the cash portion of the twc transaction consideration that were held in escrow until consummation of the twc transaction.
operating activities.  net cash provided by operating activities increased $5.7 billion during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in adjusted ebitda of $7.2 billion offset by an increase in cash paid for interest, net of $1.6 billion.
net cash provided by operating activities remained flat at $2.4 billion for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014.
investing activities. net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, was $11.3 billion, $17.0 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively. cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily represented the acquisitions of legacy twc and legacy bright house with long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents and an increase in capital expenditures of $3.5 billion as compared to 2015.
the increase in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to an increase in the investment of net proceeds from the issuance of the cco safari ii notes, cco safari iii credit facilities and ccoh safari notes related to the twc transaction in long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents offset by a decrease in long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents upon repayment of the term g loans and ccoh safari notes out of escrow related to the comcast transactions and a decrease in capital expenditures.
financing activities. net cash provided in financing activities was $4.8 billion, $14.7 billion and $6.9 billion for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. cash provided during the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily represented the issuance of $5 billion of equity to liberty broadband to fund a portion of the transactions in 2016 offset by an increase in the purchase of treasury stock of $1.5 billion as compared to 2015.
the increase in cash provided during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding period in 2014 was primarily the result of the issuance of the cco safari ii notes, cco safari iii credit facilities and ccoh safari notes related to the twc transaction offset by the repayment of $7.1 billion of net proceeds held in escrow related to the ccoh safari notes and term g loans upon the termination of the comcast transactions.
capital expenditures we have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements.  capital expenditures were $5.3 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  the increase was driven by the transactions. on a pro forma basis, assuming the transactions occurred as of january 1, 2015, the increase for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared
to the corresponding prior period was driven by higher product development investments, transition capital expenditures incurred in connection with the transactions and support capital investments. see the table below for more details.
the actual amount of our capital expenditures in 2017 will depend on a number of factors, including the pace of transition planning to service a larger customer base as a result of the transactions, our all-digital transition in the legacy twc and legacy bright house markets and growth rates of both our residential and commercial businesses.
our capital expenditures are funded primarily from cash flows from operating activities and borrowings on our credit facility. in addition, our liabilities related to capital expenditures increased by $603 million, $28 million and $33 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the following tables present our major capital expenditures categories on an actual and pro forma basis, assuming the transactions occurred as of january 1, 2015, in accordance with national cable and telecommunications association ("ncta") disclosure guidelines for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. the disclosure is intended to provide more consistency in the reporting of capital expenditures among peer companies in the cable industry. these disclosure guidelines are not required disclosures under gaap, nor do they impact our accounting for capital expenditures under gaap (dollars in millions):

(a)   the accreted values presented in the table above represent the principal amount of the debt less the original issue discount at the time of sale, deferred financing costs, and, (i) in regards to the legacy twc debt assumed, a fair value premium adjustment as a result of applying acquisition accounting plus/minus the accretion of those amounts to the balance sheet date and (ii) in regards to the fixed-rate british pound sterling denominated notes (the "sterling notes"), a remeasurement of the principal amount of the debt and any premium or discount into us dollars as of the balance sheet date. however, the amount that is currently payable if the debt becomes immediately due is equal to the principal amount of the debt. we have availability under our credit facilities of approximately $2.8 billion as of december 31, 2016.
(b)   in general, the obligors have the right to redeem all of the notes set forth in the above table in whole or in part at their option, beginning at various times prior to their stated maturity dates, subject to certain conditions, upon the payment of the outstanding principal amount (plus a specified redemption premium) and all accrued and unpaid interest. for additional information see "description of our outstanding debt" below.
see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" for further details regarding our outstanding debt and other financing arrangements, including certain information about maturities, covenants and restrictions related to such debt and financing arrangements. the agreements and instruments governing our debt and financing arrangements are complicated and you should consult such agreements and instruments which are filed with the sec for more detailed information.
at december 31, 2016, charter operating had a consolidated leverage ratio of approximately 2.8 to 1.0 and a consolidated first lien leverage ratio of 2.7 to 1.0. both ratios are in compliance with the ratios required by the charter operating credit facilities of 5.0 to 1.0 consolidated leverage ratio and 4.0 to 1.0 consolidated first lien leverage ratio. a failure by charter operating to maintain the financial covenants would result in an event of default under the charter operating credit facilities and the debt of cco holdings. see "part i. item 1a. risk factors - the agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity."

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following management discussion and analysis ("md&a") provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. we provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and reportable segment level. we also provide quantitative information regarding special (gains) and charges, discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature. qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance.
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10-k. our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. this discussion contains various non-gaap financial measures and also contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. we refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled "non-gaap financial measures" at the end of this md&a, and "forward-looking statements" and "risk factors" within items 1 and 1a of this form 10-k.
comparability of results fixed currency foreign exchange rates management evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our non-u.s. dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates, which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations. fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into u.s. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management, with all periods presented using such rates. fixed currency exchange rates are generally based on existing market rates at the time they are established. fixed currency amounts for both 2015 and 2014 also reflect all venezuelan bolivar operations, prior to the deconsolidation of our venezuelan operations, at the marginal currency system ("simadi") rate at year end 2015 of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 u.s. dollar. public currency rate data provided within the "segment performance" section of this md&a reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period, and is provided for informational purposes only.     venezuela related activities effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our venezuelan subsidiaries. prior to deconsolidation, due to the country's highly inflationary economy, the functional currency of our venezuelan subsidiaries was the u.s. dollar. as a result, currency remeasurement adjustments for non-u.s. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities of our venezuelan subsidiaries and other transactional foreign currency exchange gains and losses were reflected in earnings. across the second through fourth quarters of 2015, the venezuelan bolivar operations within our water, paper, food & beverage, institutional and energy operating segments were converted from the official exchange rate at the time of 6.3 bolivares to 1 u.s. dollar to the simadi rate at the time of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 u.s. dollar. as noted above, within our fixed currency sales and operating results, to present our historical venezuelan bolivar operations at a consistent conversion rate, we have reflected all venezuelan bolivar results for the 2015 and 2014 reporting years at a simadi conversion rate of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 u.s. dollar.
impact of acquisitions and divestitures acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture, and exclude the venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods.
executive summary we continued to work aggressively through 2016's difficult environment, where lackluster global economies, significantly unfavorable foreign currency translation and continued depressed energy market activity presented multiple headwinds to our growth.  we once again delivered superior results for customers at the lowest total operating cost to them, while also working aggressively to deliver margin improvement. we also continued to make significant investments in our customer, field and infrastructure technology as well as in our talent management systems, all key areas that will be critical to our long-term success.
in this environment, our global institutional, global industrial and other segments continued to show good fixed currency sales and earnings results. however, these were offset by a decline in the global energy segment, coupled with significantly unfavorable currency translation due to the strong dollar appreciation relative to other currencies. we worked aggressively to offset these headwinds, while making progress in our work to strengthen our businesses and position them for better growth in 2017.
sales reported sales declined 3% to $13.2 billion in 2016 from $13.5 billion in 2015. sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior year. when measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, fixed currency sales were flat compared to the prior year. see the section entitled "non-gaap financial measures" within this md&a for further information on our non-gaap measures and the "net sales" table on page 30 and the "sales by reportable segment" table on page 36 for reconciliation information.     gross margin our reported gross margin was 47.5% of sales for 2016, which compared to our 2015 reported gross margin of 46.7%. excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges included in cost of sales from both 2016 and 2015, our adjusted gross margin was 48.0% in 2016 and 47.3% in 2015. see the section entitled "non-gaap financial measures" within this md&a for further information on our non-gaap measures and the "cost of sales and gross profit margin" table on page 30 for reconciliation information.     operating income reported operating income increased 23% to $1.9 billion in 2016, compared to $1.6 billion in 2015. adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, decreased 2% in 2016. when measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 3%. see the section entitled "non-gaap financial measures" within this md&a for further information on our non-gaap measures and the "operating income" table on page 34 and operating income by reportable segment table on page 36 for reconciliation information.
earnings attributable to ecolab per common share ("eps")        reported diluted eps increased 25% to $4.14 in 2016 compared to $3.32 in 2015. special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years, driven primarily by energy related charges in 2016 and venezuelan related actions, restructuring charges and other gains and charges in both 2016 and 2015. also in 2015, special (gains) and charges included acquisition and integration related costs that were completed during the fourth quarter of 2015. adjusted diluted eps, which exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items from both 2016 and 2015 were flat at $4.37 in both 2016 and 2015. see the section entitled "non-gaap financial measures" within this md&a for further information on our non-gaap measures, and the "diluted eps" table on page 35 for reconciliation information.
balance sheet we remain committed to our stated objective of having an investment grade balance sheet, supported by our current credit ratings of a-/baa1 by the major ratings agencies, and to achieving "a" range ratings metrics. we believe that our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates.
net debt to ebitda our net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") was 2.3 and 2.6 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. our net debt to adjusted ebitda, defined as the sum of ebitda and special (gains) and charges impacting ebitda, was 2.2 for both 2016 and 2015. we view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. see the section entitled "non-gaap financial measures" within this md&a for further information on our non-gaap measures, and the "net debt to ebitda" table on page 40 for reconciliation information.
cash flow cash flow from operating activities was $1.9 billion in 2016 compared to $2.0 billion in 2015. we continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in our business, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. see the section entitled "cash flows" within this md&a for further information.     dividends we increased our quarterly cash dividend 6% in december 2016 to an indicated annual rate of $1.48 per share. the increase represents our 25th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 80th consecutive year we have paid cash dividends. our outstanding dividend history reflects our continued growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead.     critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap. our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements ("notes").
preparation of our consolidated financial statements, in conformity with u.s. gaap, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.
besides estimates that meet the "critical" estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. all estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even from estimates not deemed critical. our critical accounting estimates include the following:
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on product sales at the time evidence of an arrangement exists, title to the product and risk of loss transfers to the customer, the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured. we recognize revenue on services as they are performed. while we employ a sales and service team to ensure our customers' needs are best met in a high quality way, the majority of our revenue is generated from product sales. our service businesses and service offerings are discussed in note 17.
our sales policies do not provide for general rights of return. we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives at the time the sale is recorded. we also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits at the time of sale and anticipated uncollectible accounts, as discussed below. depending on market conditions, we may increase customer incentive offerings, which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive.
valuation allowances and accrued liabilities allowances for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age and applying historical write-off and collection trend rates. in addition, our estimates also include separately providing for customer receivables based on specific circumstances and credit conditions, and when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectible. we estimate our sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits, and apply these trend rates to calculate estimated reserves for future credits. actual results could differ from these estimates.
our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $68 million and $75 million, as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. these amounts include our allowance for sales returns and credits of $14 million and $15 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. our bad debt expense as a percent of reported net sales was 0.2% in 2016, 2015 and 2014. we believe that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience. however, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, or if unexpected events, economic downturns, or significant changes in future trends were to occur, additional allowances may be required.
for additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts, see note 2.
accrued liabilities our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. as with other companies engaged in similar manufacturing activities and providing similar products and services, some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations.
we record liabilities related to pending litigation, environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs. we record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses. expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain. while the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals, and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position.
for additional information on our commitments and contingencies, see note 15.
actuarially determined liabilities pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans the measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries. these assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses.
the significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate, expected return on assets, projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table.
·   the discount rate assumptions for our u.s. plans are assessed using a yield curve constructed from a subset of bonds yielding greater than the median return from a population of non-callable, corporate bond issues rated aa by moody's investor services or aa by standard &amp; poors. the discount rate is calculated by matching the plans' projected cash flows to the bond yield curve. for 2016, we elected to measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows. we believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans' liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. for 2015 and 2014, we measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. the change in approach did not affect the measurement of our plan obligations or the funded status of our plans. in determining our u.s. pension obligations for 2016, our weighted-average discount rate decreased to 4.27% from 4.51% at year-end 2015. in determining our u.s. postretirement health care obligation for 2016, our weighted-average discount rate decreased to 4.14% from 4.38% at year-end 2015.
·   projected salary and health care cost increases are based on our long-term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. our weighted-average projected salary increase used in determining the 2015 and 2016 u.s. pension expenses was 4.32% and for 2017 it is 4.03%. for postretirement benefit measurement purposes as of december 31, 2016, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed to be 6.75% for pre-65 costs and 7.25% for post-65 costs. the rates are assumed to decrease each year until they reach 5% in 2023 and remain at those levels thereafter.
·   in determining our u.s. pension and u.s. postretirement health care obligation for 2016, we utilized the most recent mortality table, mp-2016 projection scale (applied to the rp-2006 mortality table).
the effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of december 31, 2016, on the december 31, 2016 funded status and 2017 expense is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant u.s. plans:
effect on u.s. postretirement health care benefits plans increase in              higher assumption         recorded           2017
our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans, with the majority of the amounts held in the u.k. and eurozone countries. we use assumptions similar to our u.s. plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations, however, the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information.
see note 16 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies, estimates, funded status, contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations.
self insurance globally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses. we are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles, subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles. we are self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. we determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis.      restructuring our restructuring activities are associated with plans to enhance our efficiency, effectiveness and sharpen the competitiveness of our businesses. these restructuring plans include net costs associated with significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs and asset write-downs and disposals. employee termination costs are largely based on policies and severance plans, and include personnel reductions and related costs for severance, benefits and outplacement services. these charges are reflected in the quarter in which the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. contract termination costs include charges to terminate leases prior to the end of their respective terms and other contract termination costs. asset write-downs and disposals include leasehold improvement write-downs, other asset write-downs associated with combining operations and disposal of assets.
restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of income. amounts included as a component of cost of sales include supply chain related severance and other asset write-downs associated with combining operations. restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of both other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. restructuring charges were substantially completed within our two active plans (combined and energy) during the fourth quarter of 2015. our restructuring liability balance was $40 million and $90 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
for additional information on our current restructuring activities, see note 3.
income taxes judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, any valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions.     effective income tax rate our effective income tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions. we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. during interim periods, this expected annual rate is then applied to our year-to-date operating results. in the event that there is a significant discrete item recognized in our interim operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the same period.
tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. as a result, the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns. some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense.
deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the utilization of the entire deduction or credit. relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results, future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes. deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return, but have not yet recognized that tax benefit in our financial statements.
during the first quarter of 2016 we early-adopted the accounting guidance that requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet, using the prospective application method. periods prior to the first quarter of 2016 have not been retrospectively adjusted for adoption of this guidance.
u.s. deferred income taxes are not provided on certain unremitted foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested. undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are considered to have been reinvested indefinitely or are available for distribution with foreign tax credits available to offset the amount of applicable income tax and foreign withholding taxes that might be payable on earnings. it is impractical to determine the amount of incremental taxes on an ongoing basis that might arise if all undistributed earnings were distributed.
uncertain tax positions a number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. the number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. the internal revenue service ("irs") has completed its examinations of our federal income tax returns (ecolab and nalco) through 2012. the irs has completed examinations of our u.s. federal income tax returns (champion) through 2011 and tax year 2012 is closed by statute of limitations. our u.s. federal income tax returns for the years 2013 and 2014 are currently under audit. in addition to the u.s. federal examinations, we have ongoing audit activity in several u.s. state and foreign jurisdictions.
the tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal, state and international jurisdictions. we believe that our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations, and that our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken. because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations, we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits (including related interest and penalties) for amounts that do not meet the more-likely-than-not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance. the tax reserves are reviewed throughout the year, taking into account new legislation, regulations, case law and audit results. settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts, cash payments or receipts and/or adjustments to tax expense. the majority of our tax reserves are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within other non-current liabilities. our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $76 million and $75 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
for additional information on income taxes and adoption of new accounting guidance related to classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, see note 12 and note 2, respectively.
long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill long-lived and amortizable intangible assets we periodically review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $6.4 billion and $6.5 billion as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for impairment and to assess whether significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value.        we use the straight-line method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets, including our customer relationships. we consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships, including projected sales data, customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships.
globally, we have a broad customer base. our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions, including the customer base acquired in our recent nalco and champion transactions, which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships. our historical retention rate, coupled with our consistent track record of keeping long-term relationships with our customers, supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer base. our customer retention rate and history of maintaining long-term relationships with our significant customers are not expected to change in the future. additionally, other less certain post-acquisition operational assumptions related to future capital investments and working capital, as well as the impact of discount rate assumptions, induce variability and uncertainty in the pattern of economic benefits of our acquired customer relationships. if our customer retention rate or other post-acquisition operational activities changed materially, we would evaluate the financial impact and any corresponding triggers which could result in an acceleration of amortization or impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets.
in addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. we have experienced no significant changes in the carrying value or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets.
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets we had total goodwill of $6.4 billion and $6.5 billion as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter. our reporting units are aligned with our ten operating segments.
for our 2016 impairment assessment, we completed our assessment for goodwill impairment across our ten reporting units through a quantitative analysis, utilizing a discounted cash flow approach. the two-step quantitative process involved comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired, and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any. our goodwill impairment assessment for 2016 indicated the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the unit's carrying amount by a significant margin. we will continue to assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments. no events during the second half of 2016 indicated a need to update our conclusions reached during the second quarter of 2016.
as part of the nalco merger, we added the "nalco" trade name as an indefinite life intangible asset, the total value of which was $1.2 billion as of december 31, 2016 and 2015. the carrying value of the indefinite life trade name was subject to annual impairment testing, using a relief from royalty assessment method, during the second quarter of 2016. based on this testing, no adjustment to the carrying value was necessary. additionally, no events during the second half of 2016 indicated a need to update our conclusions reached during the second quarter of 2016.

cost of sales ("cos") and gross profit margin ("gross margin")
our reported gross margin was 47.5%, 46.7% and 46.2% for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. our 2016, 2015 and 2014 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special (gains) and charges of $66.0 million, $80.6 million and $14.3 million, respectively. special (gains) and charges items impacting cos are shown within the special (gains) and charges table on page 31.
the increased sg&a ratio (sg&a expenses as a percentage of reported net sales) comparing 2016 against 2015 was driven primarily by the impact of acquisitions, investments in the business and the decline in global energy, which on average has a lower sg&a ratio.
special (gains) and charges special (gains) and charges reported on the consolidated statement of income included the following items:

restructuring activities restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of income. further details related to our restructuring charges are included in note 3.     energy restructuring plan in april 2013, following the completion of the champion transaction, we commenced plans to undertake restructuring and other cost-saving actions to realize our acquisition-related cost synergies as well as streamline and strengthen our position in the global energy market (the "energy restructuring plan"). actions associated with the acquisition to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the business included a reduction of the combined business's global workforce. actions also included leveraging and simplifying our global supply chain, including the reduction of plant, distribution center and redundant facility locations and product line optimization.
restructuring charges within the energy restructuring plan were substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2015 with certain immaterial actions continuing into 2016. cumulative restructuring charges of $89 million ($60 million after tax and net of the impact from noncontrolling interest), are materially consistent with our initial expectation of $80 million ($55 million after tax).
we recorded restructuring charges of $4.5 million ($2.6 million after tax) or $0.01 per diluted share, $47.2 million ($33.0 million after tax) or $0.10 per diluted share and $9.5 million ($6.4 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. as a result of the ownership structure of certain entities holding energy restructuring charges, we reflected $1.7 million of the 2015 charges as a component of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of income.
net cash payments under the energy restructuring plan were $14.4 million during 2016 and $42.5 million from 2013 through 2015. the majority of cash payments under this plan are related to severance, with the current accrual expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters. we anticipate the remaining cash expenditures will be funded from operating activities.
during 2016 the energy restructuring plan achieved approximately $25 million of incremental savings as compared to 2015. cumulative cost savings from this plan, along with synergies achieved in connection with the acquisition, were approximately $150 million through 2016 and are materially consistent with our original expectations.
combined restructuring plan in february 2011, we commenced a comprehensive plan to substantially improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our european business, as well as undertake certain restructuring activities outside of europe, historically referred to as the "2011 restructuring plan". additionally, in january 2012, following the merger with nalco, we formally commenced plans to undertake restructuring actions related to the reduction of our global workforce and optimization of our supply chain and office facilities, including planned reductions of plant and distribution center locations, historically referred to as the "merger restructuring plan". during the first quarter of 2013, we determined that the objectives of the plans discussed above were aligned, and consequently, the previously separate restructuring plans were combined into one plan.
the combined restructuring plan (the "combined plan") combines opportunities and initiatives from both plans and continues to follow the original format of the merger restructuring plan by focusing on global actions related to optimization of the supply chain and office facilities, including reductions of the global workforce, plant and distribution center locations.
restructuring charges within the combined plan were substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2015, with certain immaterial actions continuing into 2016. cumulative restructuring charges of $391 million ($297 million after tax), are materially consistent with our initial expectation of $400 million ($300 million after tax).
we recorded net gains of $13.6 million ($13.4 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share during 2016 primarily related to gains on the sale of certain facilities related to previous restructuring initiatives. we recorded net charges of $53.0 million ($44.2 million after tax) or $0.15 per diluted share and $73.5 million ($58.5 million after tax) or $0.19 per diluted share during 2015 and 2014, respectively.
net cash payments under the combined plan were $14.9 million during 2016 and $303.1 million from 2011 through 2015. the majority of cash payments under the combined plan are related to severance, with the current accrual expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters. we anticipate the remaining cash expenditures will continue to be funded from operating activities.
during 2016, the combined plan achieved approximately $25 million of incremental savings as compared to 2015. cumulative cost savings from this plan, along with annual cost saving and synergies, were approximately $420 million through 2016 and are materially consistent with our original expectations.
non-restructuring special (gains) and charges energy related charges oil industry activity remained depressed during 2016 when compared with 2014 levels, resulting from continued excess oil supply pressures, which have negatively impacted exploration and production investments in the energy industry, particularly in north america. during the second and fourth quarters of 2016, as a result of these conditions and their corresponding impact on our business outlook, we recorded total charges of $76.8 million ($50.0 million after tax) or $0.17 per diluted share, comprised of inventory write-downs and related disposal costs, fixed asset charges, headcount reductions and other charges.
the inventory write-downs and related disposal costs of $40.5 million include adjustments due to the significant decline in activity and related prices of certain specific-use and other products, coupled with declines in replacement costs, as well as estimated costs to dispose the respective excess inventory. the fixed asset charges of $20.4 million resulted from the write-down of certain assets related to the reduction of certain aspects of our north american operations within the global energy segment, as well as abandonment of certain projects under construction. the carrying value of the corresponding fixed assets was reduced to zero. the employee termination costs of $13.1 million include a reduction in our global energy segment's global workforce to better align its workforce with anticipated activity levels in the near term. as of the end of 2016, we had $7.4 million of corresponding severance remaining to be paid, which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months and be funded from operating activities.
venezuela related activities effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for the investments in our venezuelan subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting effective in the first quarter of 2016. we used the cost method of accounting for the investment in our venezuelan subsidiaries throughout 2016 as the conditions within venezuela driving this decision remained in place during 2016. prior to deconsolidation, we remeasured our venezuelan bolivar operations within our water, paper, food & beverage, institutional and the bolivar portion of our venezuelan operations within energy operating segments from the official exchange rate at the time of 6.3 bolivares to 1 u.s. dollar to the simadi rate at the time of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 u.s. dollar. as a result of the ownership structure of our food & beverage and institutional operations in venezuela, we reflected a portion of the devaluation impact as a component of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of income. upon deconsolidation, we recorded a charge to fully write off our intercompany receivables and investment. the total charges during 2015 related to our actions in venezuela were $289.3 million ($246.8 million after tax). as a result of the ownership structure of our food & beverage and institutional operations in venezuela, we reflected $11.1 million of the above charges as a component of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of income, resulting in a net charge of $235.7 million or $0.78 per diluted share.
during 2016, we recorded a gain of $7.8 million ($4.9 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share resulting from u.s. dollar cash recoveries of intercompany receivables written off at the time of deconsolidation.
fixed asset impairment and other inventory charges during 2015, we recorded a fixed asset impairment charge of $24.7 million ($15.4 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share, consisting of certain production equipment and buildings within one of our u.s. plants. the impaired facility is a specialized facility used for dry polymer production. due to market contraction in the oil and the mining industries, and the aggressive competitive pricing environment for dry polymers, the facility has not reached production volumes to recover the value of the underlying fixed assets.
during 2016, we recorded an additional charge of $10.0 million ($6.3 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share related to the dry polymer fixed asset impairment, as well as related inventory charges. subsequent to the charge, the remaining value of the underlying fixed assets is less than $5 million. inventory charges include adjustments due to the significant decline in activity and related prices of the corresponding dry polymer products.
these items have been included as a component of cost of sales on the consolidated statement of income.
inventory costs and inventory reserve during 2015, we improved and standardized estimates related to our inventory reserves and product costing, resulting in a net pre-tax charge of approximately $6 million. separately, the actions resulted in a charge of $20.6 million ($15.9 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share, related to inventory reserve calculations, partially offset by a gain of $14.5 million ($12.2 million after tax), or $0.04 per diluted share, related to the capitalization of certain cost components into inventory. during 2016, we took additional actions related to the capitalization of certain cost components into inventory, which resulted in a gain of $6.2 million ($4.6 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share.
these items have been included as a component of cost of sales on the consolidated statement of income.
champion and nalco integration costs integration related special charges for the champion acquisition and nalco merger were completed during the fourth quarter of 2015, and we did not incur any special charges related to such transactions during 2016. as a result of the champion acquisition and nalco merger, we incurred charges of $18.7 million ($12.0 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share and $28.4 million ($19.8 million after tax) or $0.06 per diluted share, during 2015 and 2014, respectively. champion and nalco integration charges have been included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the consolidated statement of income.
other special (gains) and charges during 2016, we recorded charges of $41.8 million ($26.4 million after tax) or $0.09 per diluted share, primarily consisting of litigation related charges.
during 2015, we recorded a net charge of $56.3 million ($34.5 million after tax), or $0.11 per diluted share, primarily made up of litigation related charges and the recognition of a loss on the sale of a portion of our ecovation business, offset partially by the recovery of funds deposited into escrow as part of the champion transaction.
during 2014, we recorded a special gain of $28.4 million ($23.3 million after tax), or $0.08 per diluted share, as a result of a favorable licensing settlement and other settlement gains, the consolidation of the emirates national chemicals company llc ("emochem") entity and removal of the corresponding equity method investment and the disposition of a business.
as shown in the previous table, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on adjusted operating income growth for both 2016 and 2015, as adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 3% for 2016 and 8% for 2015. acquisitions and divestitures negatively impacted our 2016 adjusted fixed currency operating income growth rates by approximately 1 percentage point. in 2015, acquisitions and divestitures added 1 percentage point to fixed currency operating income growth.
as addressed further in the "segment performance" section of this md&a, comparisons across 2014 to 2016 were impacted by growth in global industrial, global institutional and other offset by the continued challenges within global energy.

our reported tax rate for 2016, 2015 and 2014 includes the tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items, which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates, as amounts included in our special gains and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our overall non-gaap adjusted tax rate, and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods. the tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future.
our 2016 reported tax rate includes $43.1 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net expenses of $3.9 million associated with discrete tax items. our 2015 reported tax rate includes $105.7 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net benefits of $63.3 million associated with discrete tax items. our 2014 reported tax rate includes $21.6 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net expense of $13.2 million associated with discrete tax items. the corresponding impact of these items on the reported tax rate is shown in the table above.
during 2016, we recognized net expenses related to discrete tax items of $3.9 million. the net expenses were driven primarily by recognizing adjustments from filing our 2015 u.s. federal income tax return, partially offset by settlement of international tax matters and remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the application of updated tax rates in international jurisdictions. net expenses were also impacted by adjustments to deferred tax asset and liability positions and the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in non-u.s. jurisdictions.
net benefits related to discrete tax items in 2015 were driven primarily by the release of $20.6 million of valuation allowances based on the realizability of foreign deferred tax assets and our ability to recognize a worthless stock deduction of $39.0 million for the tax basis in a wholly-owned domestic subsidiary.
net expenses related to discrete tax items in 2014 were driven primarily by an update to non-current tax liabilities for certain global tax audits, an adjustment related to the re-characterization of intercompany payments between our u.s. and foreign affiliates, the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from changes in our deferred state tax rate, recognizing adjustments from filing our 2013 u.s. federal and state tax returns, net changes of valuation allowances based on the realizability of foreign deferred tax assets and the impact from other foreign country audit settlements.
the decrease in our adjusted tax rate from 2014 to 2016 was impacted by global tax planning projects, as well as favorable geographic income mix. future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors, including but not limited to, u.s. domestic tax reform proposals, further tax planning projects and geographic income mix.
discrete tax net expense (benefit)                                  3.9                  (63.3)                13.2

currency translation had a significant unfavorable impact on reported and adjusted diluted eps comparability across 2014 to 2016, with headwinds of approximately $0.31 per share for 2016 compared to 2015 and approximately $0.30 per share for 2015 compared to 2014.
segment performance the non-u.s. dollar functional international amounts included within our reportable segments are based on translation into u.s. dollars at the fixed currency exchange rates used by management for 2016. the difference between the fixed currency exchange rates and the actual currency exchange rates is reported as "effect of foreign currency translation" in the following tables. fixed currency amounts for both 2015 and 2014 also reflect all venezuelan bolivar operations, prior to deconsolidation of our venezuelan operations, at a simadi rate of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 u.s. dollar. all other accounting policies of the reportable segments are consistent with u.s. gaap and the accounting policies described in note 2. additional information about our reportable segments is included in note 17.

we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in the business, debt repayments and pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases.
comparability of cash generated from operating activities across 2014 to 2016 was impacted by fluctuations in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable ("working capital"), the combination of which increased $35 million, $119 million and $212 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively. the cash flow impact across the three years from accounts receivable was driven by changes in sales volumes and timing of collections. the cash flow impact across the three years from inventories was impacted by timing of purchases and production and usage levels, and from accounts payable was impacted by volume of purchases and timing of payments.
the impact on operating cash flows of pension and postretirement plan contributions, cash activity related to restructuring, cash paid for income taxes and cash paid for interest, are shown in the following table:

cash used for investing activities is primarily impacted by the timing of business acquisitions and dispositions as well as from capital investments in the business.
total cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired and net of cash received from dispositions, in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $49 million, $265 million and $72 million, respectively. our acquisitions and divestitures across 2016, 2015 and 2014 are discussed further in note 4. we continue to target strategic business acquisitions which complement our growth strategy and expect to continue to make capital investments and acquisitions in the future to support our long-term growth.
we continue to make capital investments in the business, including merchandising and customer equipment and manufacturing facilities. total capital expenditures, including software, were $757 million, $815 million and $794 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
comparability of cash used for investing activities across 2014 to 2016 was impacted by other factors, including the following:

our cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the issuances and repayment of debt, common stock repurchases, proceeds from common stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs, dividend payments and acquisition-related contingent consideration.
our 2016 debt financing activities included the issuance of €575 million 1.00%, $750 million 2.70%, $250 million 3.70%, $400 million 2.00% and $400 million 3.25% fixed rate senior notes; the scheduled repayment of our $1.25 billion 3.00% and €175 million 4.585% senior notes and repayment of the remaining $125 million of our term loan borrowings. net issuances and repayments of commercial paper and notes payable led to a net decrease of $606 million during 2016.
our 2015 debt financing activities included the issuance of $300 million 1.55%, $300 million 2.25% and €575 million 2.625% fixed rate senior notes; the scheduled repayment of our $250 million 4.875% and $500 million 1.00% senior notes; and repayment of $275 million of term loan borrowings. net repayments of commercial paper and notes payable led to a net decrease of $312 million during 2015.
our 2014 debt financing activities included the repayment of $400 million of term loan borrowings, and the scheduled repayment of our $500 million 2.375% senior notes. net borrowings of commercial paper and notes payable led to a net cash inflow of $600 million during 2014.
shares are repurchased for the purpose of partially offsetting the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans and stock issued in acquisitions, to manage our capital structure and to efficiently return capital to shareholders.
in february 2015, we announced a $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which was completed during the second quarter of 2016. we repurchased a total of $740 million and $755 million of shares in 2016 and 2015, respectively. these amounts include $300 million of shares repurchased through the asr program in both 2016 and 2015, respectively. see note 10 for further information regarding our asr programs. during 2014, we repurchased $429 million of shares. cash proceeds and tax benefits from stock option exercises provide a portion of the funding for repurchase activity.
financing activities for 2014 also included an acquisition-related contingent consideration payment of $86 million made to champion's former shareholders.
liquidity and capital resources we currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for 2017, including scheduled debt repayments, new investments in the business, share repurchases, dividend payments, possible business acquisitions and pension contributions, with cash from operating activities, and as needed, additional short-term and/or long-term borrowings. we continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong.
as of december 31, 2015, we had $26 million of deferred tax liabilities for pre-acquisition foreign earnings associated with the legacy nalco entities and legacy champion entities that we intended to repatriate. these liabilities were recorded as part of the respective purchase price accounting of each transaction. the remaining foreign earnings were repatriated in 2016, reducing the deferred tax liabilities to zero at december 31, 2016.
we consider the remaining portion of our foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions and we have no intention to repatriate such funds. we continue to be focused on building our global business and these funds are available for use by our international operations. to the extent the remaining portion of the foreign earnings would be repatriated, such amounts would be subject to income tax or foreign withholding tax liabilities that may be fully or partially offset by foreign tax credits, both in the u.s. and in various applicable foreign jurisdictions.
as of december 31, 2016 we had a $2.0 billion multi-year credit facility, which expires in december 2019. the credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks. there were no borrowings under our credit facility as of december 31, 2016 or 2015.
the credit facility supports our $2.0 billion u.s. commercial paper program and $2.0 billion european commercial paper program. we increased the european commercial paper program from $200 million during the third quarter of 2016. combined borrowing under these two commercial paper programs may not exceed $2.0 billion. as of december 31, 2016, we had no amount outstanding under either our u.s. or european commercial paper programs.
additionally, we have other committed and uncommitted credit lines of $746 million with major international banks and financial institutions to support our general global funding needs, including with respect to bank supported letters of credit, performance bonds and guarantees. approximately $554 million of these credit lines were available for use as of year-end 2016.
as of december 31, 2016, standard & poor's and moody's rated our long-term credit at a- (stable outlook) and baa1 (stable outlook), respectively. a reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs, or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or negotiate new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities. should this occur, we could seek additional sources of funding, including issuing additional term notes or bonds. in addition, we have the ability, at our option, to draw upon our $2.0 billion of committed credit facility prior to termination.
we are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures.
a schedule of our obligations as of december 31, 2016 under various notes payable, long-term debt agreements, operating leases with noncancelable terms in excess of one year and interest obligations are summarized in the following table:
capital lease obligations             5            1                  1                  1        2
as of december 31, 2016, our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $76 million. we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required. therefore, these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.
we are not required to make any contributions to our u.s. pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans in 2017 based on plan asset values as of december 31, 2016. we are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements. we estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate $42 million in 2017. these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.
we lease certain sales and administrative office facilities, distribution centers, research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longer-term operating leases. vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration. vehicle leases have guaranteed residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles.
except for the approximately $192 million utilized under the bank lines noted previously supporting domestic and international commercial relationships and transactions, we do not have significant unconditional purchase obligations or significant other commercial commitments.
off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases, as discussed further in note 13, we do not participate in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. through the normal course of business, we have established various joint ventures that have not been consolidated within our financial statements as we are not the primary beneficiary. the joint ventures help us meet local ownership requirements, achieve quicker operational scale, expand our ability to provide customers a more fully integrated offering or provide other benefits to our business or customers. these entities have not been utilized as special purposes entities, which are sometimes established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. as such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.     market risk we enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing monitoring and reporting, and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows.
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements, and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than u.s. dollars. we use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. as of december 31, 2016, we had a total of €1,150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges.
we manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. to help manage borrowing costs, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements. under these arrangements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. as of december 31, 2016, we had interest rate swaps outstanding with notional values of $1,450 million.
see note 8 for further information on our hedging activity.
based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10% adverse change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increase/decrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately $50 million. the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.
global economic and political environment energy markets during 2016, approximately 23% of our sales were generated from global energy, the results of which, as noted further below, are subject to volatility in the oil and gas commodity markets.
oil industry activity remained depressed during 2016, when compared with 2014 levels, resulting from continued excess oil supply pressures, which have negatively impacted exploration and production investments in the energy industry, particularly in north america. we also experienced additional pricing headwinds in 2016 when compared to 2015. as a result of these conditions, we recorded charges related to inventory write-downs and related disposal costs, fixed asset charges, employee termination costs and other charges during the second and fourth quarters of 2016, as discussed further in note 3.
our global footprint and broad business portfolio within global energy, as well as our strong execution capabilities are expected to provide the required resilience to outperform in the current market. as such, we continue to remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of the segment.
as petroleum derived materials are key inputs to many of our chemical products, lower oil prices provide benefits across our segments in the form of lower raw material costs.
global economies approximately half of our sales are outside of the united states. our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results.     brexit referendum the june 23, 2016 referendum by british voters to exit the european union ("brexit") resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the british pound, as compared to the u.s. dollar and other currencies.
brexit is non-binding; however, if passed into law, negotiations would commence to determine the future terms of the u.k.'s relationship with the european union. the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the u.k. makes to retain access to european union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term as the u.k. negotiates its exit from the european union. in the longer term, any impact from brexit on our u.k. operations will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations.
global foreign currency markets the u.s. dollar remained strong against most global currencies during 2016, when compared against both 2015 and 2014 levels, impacting our comparative results. as described in note 8, we utilize our derivative program to mitigate risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures and our investments in foreign operations.      new accounting pronouncements information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note 2.
subsequent events in january 2017, we acquired abednego environmental services ("abednego"), a privately held company based in novi, michigan. abednego provides water solutions to automotive customers. pre-acquisition annual sales were approximately $40 million.
on february 1, 2017, we acquired anios for a total consideration of approximately $800 million in cash, inclusive of the satisfaction of outstanding debt. anios is a leading european manufacturer and marketer of hygiene and disinfection products for the healthcare, food service, and food and beverage processing industries. anios provides an innovative product line that expands the solutions we are able to offer while also providing a complementary geographic footprint within the healthcare market. pre-acquisition annual sales were approximately $245 million.
in february 2017, we entered into an asr agreement with a financial institution to repurchase $300 million of our common stock.
non-gaap financial measures this md&a includes financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap. these non-gaap measures include:
  acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales
  acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income
  acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin
  ebitda
  adjusted ebitda
we provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. we use these non-gaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.
our non-gaap financial measures for cost of sales, gross margin and operating income exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, and our non-gaap measures for tax rate, net income attributable to ecolab and diluted eps further exclude the impact of discrete tax items. we include items within special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items that we believe can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results. after tax special (gains) and charges are derived by applying the applicable local jurisdictional tax rate to the corresponding pre-tax special (gains) and charges.
ebitda is defined as the sum of net income including non-controlling interest, provision for income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization. adjusted ebitda is defined as the sum of ebitda and special (gains) and charges impacting ebitda. ebitda and adjusted ebitda are used as inputs to our net debt to ebitda and net debt to adjusted ebitda ratios. we view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization.
acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture, and exclude the venezuelan results of operations from both the current period and comparable period of the prior year.
these non-gaap measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to u.s. gaap, and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. we recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the u.s. gaap measures included in this md&a and we have provided reconciliations of reported u.s. gaap amounts to the non-gaap amounts.

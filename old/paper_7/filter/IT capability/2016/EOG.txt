item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview eog resources, inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, eog), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the united states with proved reserves in the united states, trinidad, the united kingdom and china.  eog operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries.  each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return. this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing eog to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet.  eog implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves.  maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eog's strategy.
united states. eog's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful. eog continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to, and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to, eog's crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas production. eog has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs.
during 2016, eog continued to focus on increasing drilling and completion efficiencies using precision lateral targeting and advanced completion methods and reducing operating and capital costs through efficiency improvements and service cost reductions. these efficiency gains along with realized lower service costs resulted in lower drilling and completion costs and decreased operating expenses during 2016. eog continues to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions, farm-ins or tactical acquisitions and to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects. on a volumetric basis, as calculated using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngls to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and ngl production accounted for approximately 73% of united states production during 2016 as compared to 71% for 2015. during 2016, drilling and completion activities occurred primarily in the eagle ford play, delaware basin play and rocky mountain area. eog's major producing areas in the united states are in new mexico, north dakota, texas, utah and wyoming.
on october 4, 2016, eog completed its previously announced mergers and related asset purchase transactions with yates petroleum corporation (ypc), abo petroleum corporation (abo), myco industries, inc. (myco) and certain affiliated entities (collectively with ypc, abo and myco, the yates entities). the yates entities had recent net production of approximately 28,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 48% crude oil. the assets of the yates entities include 1.6 million total net acres, with approximately 180,000 net acres in the delaware basin core, approximately 200,000 net acres in the powder river basin and approximately 130,000 net acres in the permian basin northwest shelf. the financial results of ypc, abo and myco were included in eog's consolidated financial statements beginning october 4, 2016.
trinidad. in trinidad, eog continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. several fields in the south east coast consortium (secc) block, modified u(a) block, block 4(a) and modified u(b) block and the sercan area (formerly known as the emz area) have been developed and are producing natural gas which is sold to the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited and its subsidiary and crude oil and condensate which is sold to the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago limited. in the third quarter of 2016, eog installed a platform and pipeline in the sercan area in preparation for its three net well drilling program. in the fourth quarter of 2016, eog drilled and completed one net well and began drilling a second well. eog expects to bring the remaining two net wells of the sercan program on-line in early 2017 and to drill three additional net wells in the second half of 2017.
other international.  in the united kingdom, eog began production from its 100% working interest east irish sea conwy crude oil project in march 2016, selling its first crude oil cargo at the end of the first quarter. modifications to the nearby third-party-owned douglas platform, which is used to process conwy production, were completed in the first quarter of 2016 and acceptance and performance testing is ongoing.
during the third quarter of 2016, eog successfully completed the sale of all its argentina assets.
eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states, primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified.
capital structure one of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in eog's peer group.  eog's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 33% at december 31, 2016 and 34% at december 31, 2015.  as used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity.
on october 4, 2016, in connection with the mergers and related asset purchase transactions with the yates entities, eog issued an aggregate of approximately 25 million shares of eog common stock, subject to the terms of the agreements, and paid to certain of the sellers under the asset purchase transactions an aggregate of approximately $16 million in cash for total consideration transferred of approximately $2.4 billion. in addition, under the terms of the agreements, eog assumed and repaid approximately $164 million of debt owed by the yates entities, which was offset by approximately $70 million of cash of the yates entities.
at december 31, 2016, the $600 million aggregate principal amount of eog's 5.875% senior notes due 2017 were reclassified as long-term debt based upon its intent and ability to ultimately replace such amount with other long-term debt.
on february 1, 2016, eog repaid upon maturity the $400 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.500% senior notes due 2016 (2016 notes).
on january 14, 2016, eog closed its sale of $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.15% senior notes due 2026 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.10% senior notes due 2036 (collectively, the notes). interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on january 15 and july 15 of each year, beginning on july 15, 2016. net proceeds from the notes offering totaled approximately $991 million and were used to repay the 2016 notes when they matured on february 1, 2016, and for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and funding of capital expenditures.
during 2016, eog funded $6.6 billion ($3.9 billion of which was related to the aforementioned yates transaction) in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement obligations), repaid $564 million aggregate principal amount of long-term debt, paid $373 million in dividends to common stockholders, repaid $260 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and purchased $82 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans, primarily by utilizing net cash provided from its operating activities, net proceeds of $1,119 million from the sale of assets, net proceeds from the sale of the notes and $29 million of excess tax benefits from stock compensation.
total anticipated 2017 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, excluding acquisitions. the majority of 2017 expenditures will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activities. eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings.
when it fits eog's strategy, eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eog's history.
results of operations the following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2016, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and notes thereto beginning on page f-1.
net operating revenues during 2016, net operating revenues decreased $1,106 million, or 13%, to $7,651 million from $8,757 million in 2015. total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of eog's production of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas, decreased $907 million, or 14%, to $5,497 million in 2016 from $6,404 million in 2015. revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and ngls in 2016 were approximately 86% of total wellhead revenues compared to 83% in 2015. during 2016, eog recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $100 million compared to net gains of $62 million in 2015. gathering, processing and marketing revenues decreased $287 million during 2016, to $1,966 million from $2,253 million in 2015. net gains on asset dispositions of $206 million in 2016 were primarily as a result of sales of producing properties and acreage in texas, louisiana, the rocky mountain area and oklahoma compared to net losses on asset dispositions of $9 million in 2015.

2016 compared to 2015. wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2016 decreased $618 million, or 13%, to $4,317 million from $4,935 million in 2015, due primarily to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price. eog's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2016 decreased 12% to $41.76 per barrel compared to $47.53 per barrel in 2015. wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries in 2016 decreased 1% to 283 mbbld as compared to 284 mbbld in 2015. the decreased production was primarily due to lower production in the eagle ford and the rocky mountain area, largely offset by increased production in the permian basin.
wellhead natural gas revenues in 2016 decreased $319 million, or 30%, to $742 million from $1,061 million in 2015, primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price ($246 million) and a decrease in wellhead natural gas deliveries ($73 million). eog's composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 25% to $1.73 per mcf in 2016 compared to $2.30 per mcf in 2015. natural gas deliveries in 2016 decreased 7% to 1,175 mmcfd as compared to 1,265 mmcfd in 2015. the decrease in production was primarily due to decreased production in the united states (76 mmcfd). the decreased production was due primarily to lower volumes in the fort worth barnett shale, upper gulf coast and south texas areas, largely resulting from asset sales in these regions during the year, partially offset by increased production of associated gas in the permian basin and the acquisition of the yates entities.
during 2016, eog recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $100 million, which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $22 million. during 2015, eog recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $730 million.
gathering, processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of third-party crude oil, ngls, and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas and revenues from sales of eog-owned sand. purchases and sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eog-owned facilities. marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing third-party crude oil and natural gas and the associated transportation costs as well as costs associated with eog-owned sand sold to third parties.
gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2016 increased $91 million compared to 2015, primarily due to higher margins on crude oil marketing activities and on sand sales.
2015 compared to 2014. wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2015 decreased $4,807 million, or 49%, to $4,935 million from $9,742 million in 2014, due to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($4,677 million) and a decrease of 5 mbbld, or 2%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($131 million). the decrease in deliveries primarily reflects decreased production in the north dakota bakken, the fort worth barnett shale area and other international, partially offset by increased production in the permian basin and eagle ford. the decrease in other international is due to the sale of the canadian assets. eog's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2015 decreased 49% to $47.53 per barrel compared to $92.58 per barrel in 2014.
ngl revenues in 2015 decreased $526 million, or 56%, to $408 million from $934 million in 2014, due to a lower composite average price ($490 million) and a decrease of 3 mbbld, or 4%, in ngl deliveries ($36 million). eog's composite ngl price in 2015 decreased 55% to $14.49 per barrel compared to $31.91 per barrel in 2014.
wellhead natural gas revenues in 2015 decreased $855 million, or 45%, to $1,061 million from $1,916 million in 2014, primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price ($730 million) and a decrease in wellhead natural gas deliveries ($125 million). eog's composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 41% to $2.30 per mcf in 2015 compared to $3.88 per mcf in 2014. natural gas deliveries in 2015 decreased 7% to 1,265 mmcfd as compared to 1,353 mmcfd in 2014. the decrease in production was due to decreased production in other international (40 mmcfd), the united states (34 mmcfd) and trinidad (14 mmcfd). in the united states, decreased production was due primarily to lower production in the upper gulf coast, fort worth barnett shale and south texas areas, partially offset by increased production of associated gas in the eagle ford and permian basin. the decline in other international primarily reflects the sale of the canadian assets.
during 2015, eog recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $730 million. during 2014, eog recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $834 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $34 million.
gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2015 declined $53 million compared to 2014, primarily due to lower margins on crude oil and natural gas marketing activities and losses on sand sales.
2016 compared to 2015.  during 2016, operating expenses of $8,876 million were $6,568 million lower than the $15,444 million incurred during 2015.  operating expenses for 2015 included impairments of proved properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets of $6,326 million primarily due to commodity price declines. the following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015:
the primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, dd&a, g&a and net interest expense for 2016 compared to 2015 are set forth below.  see "net operating revenues" above for a discussion of production volumes.
each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations.  eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas.  operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors, fluctuate over time.
lease and well expenses of $927 million in 2016 decreased $255 million from $1,182 million in 2015 primarily due to lower operating and maintenance costs ($218 million) and lower lease and well administrative expenses ($35 million), both in the united states.
transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale.  transportation costs include transportation fees, costs associated with crude-by-rail operations, the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees and fuel costs.
dd&a of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method.  eog's dd&a rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual dd&a group calculations.  there are several factors that can impact eog's composite dd&a rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance, economic factors and impairments.  changes to these factors may cause eog's composite dd&a rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period.  dd&a of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets.
dd&a expenses in 2016 increased $239 million to $3,553 million from $3,314 million in 2015.  dd&a expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2016 were $247 million higher than in 2015 primarily due to higher unit rates in the united states ($300 million) and china ($3 million) and commencement of crude oil production from the conwy field in the united kingdom ($22 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in the united states ($68 million) and trinidad ($4 million) and lower unit rates in trinidad ($6 million). unit rates in the united states increased primarily due to downward reserve revisions at december 31, 2015, as a result of lower commodity prices.
g&a expenses of $395 million in 2016 increased $28 million from $367 million in 2015 primarily due to employee-related expenses in connection with certain voluntary retirements and costs related to the yates transaction.
net interest expense of $282 million in 2016 was $45 million higher than 2015 primarily due to interest incurred on the notes issued in january 2016 ($43 million), as well as a decrease in capitalized interest ($10 million). this was partially offset by the reduction of interest expense related to the debt repaid in february 2016 and june 2015 ($16 million).
gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating eog's gathering and processing assets.
gathering and processing costs decreased $23 million to $123 million in 2016 compared to $146 million in 2015 due to decreased activities in the eagle ford ($16 million) and the barnett shale ($7 million).
exploration costs of $125 million in 2016 decreased $24 million from $149 million in 2015 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures ($15 million) and lower exploration administrative expenses ($14 million), partially offset by higher delay rentals ($5 million), all in the united states.
impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets.  unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term.  when circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a dd&a group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset.  if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value.  fair value is generally calculated by using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the financial accounting standards board's accounting standards codification (asc).  in certain instances, eog utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value.
firm commitment contracts                 138                   -
impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the write-down to fair value of divested legacy natural gas assets in 2016 and primarily due to commodity price declines in 2015. impairments of unproved properties were primarily due to higher amortization rates being applied to undeveloped leasehold costs in response to the significant decrease in commodity prices and an increase in eog's estimates of undeveloped properties not expected to be developed before lease expiration in 2016 and 2015. eog recognized additional impairment charges in 2016 of $61 million related to obsolete inventory and $138 million related to firm commitment contracts related to divested haynesville natural gas assets.
taxes other than income in 2016 decreased $72 million to $350 million (6.4% of wellhead revenues) from $422 million (6.6% of wellhead revenues) in 2015. the decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreases in ad valorem/property taxes ($49 million) and in severance/production taxes ($34 million), primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues, both in the united states. these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in credits available to eog in 2016 for texas high-cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($12 million).
eog recognized an income tax benefit of $461 million in 2016 compared to an income tax benefit of $2,397 million in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in pretax loss resulting from the absence of certain 2015 impairments. the net effective tax rate for 2016 decreased to 30% from 35% in the prior year primarily due to additional trinidad taxes resulting from a tax settlement reached in the second quarter of 2016 ($43 million).
2015 compared to 2014.  during 2015, operating expenses of $15,444 million were $2,650 million higher than the $12,794 million incurred during 2014.  operating expenses for 2015 included impairments of proved properties, other property, plant and equipment and other assets of $6,326 million primarily due to commodity price declines. the following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014:
the primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, dd&a, g&a and net interest expense for 2015 compared to 2014 are set forth below.  see "net operating revenues" above for a discussion of production volumes.
lease and well expenses of $1,182 million in 2015 decreased $234 million from $1,416 million in 2014 primarily due to lower operating and maintenance costs in the united states ($125 million), lower lease and well expenses in other international ($99 million) primarily due to the sale of the canadian assets and lower workover expenditures in the united states ($21 million), partially offset by increased lease and well administrative expenses in the united states ($12 million).
dd&a expenses in 2015 decreased $683 million to $3,314 million from $3,997 million in 2014.  dd&a expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2015 were $691 million lower than in 2014 primarily due to lower unit rates in the united states ($513 million) and trinidad ($28 million), a decrease in production in the united states ($44 million) and lower dd&a expense in other international ($104 million) primarily due to the sale of the canadian assets.  unit rates in the united states decreased primarily due to impairments of proved oil and gas properties (see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements), upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies.
net interest expense of $237 million in 2015 was $36 million higher than 2014 primarily due to interest incurred on the notes issued in march 2015 ($28 million), as well as a decrease in capitalized interest ($15 million). this was partially offset by the reduction of interest on debt repaid in june 2015 and during 2014 ($11 million).
exploration costs of $149 million in 2015 decreased $35 million from $184 million in 2014 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states ($19 million) and lower exploration administrative expenses in other international ($10 million) primarily due to the sale of the canadian assets.
impairments of $6,614 million in 2015 increased $5,870 million from $744 million in 2014 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties and other assets in the united states ($5,959 million), primarily due to commodity price declines; and increased amortization of unproved property costs in the united states ($112 million), which was caused by higher amortization rates being applied to undeveloped leasehold costs in response to the significant decrease in commodity prices and an increase in eog's estimates of undeveloped properties not expected to be developed before lease expiration; partially offset by decreased impairments of proved properties in the united kingdom ($156 million) and argentina ($43 million). proved property and other asset impairments in the united states were primarily related to legacy natural gas assets and marginal liquids plays. eog recorded impairments of proved properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets of $6,326 million and $575 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
taxes other than income in 2015 decreased $336 million to $422 million (6.6% of wellhead revenues) from $758 million (6.0% of wellhead revenues) in 2014. the decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreases in severance/production taxes ($307 million), primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues and lower ad valorem/property taxes ($17 million), both in the united states.
eog recognized an income tax benefit of $2,397 million in 2015 compared to an income tax expense of $2,080 million in 2014 primarily due to impairments recognized in the united states in 2015. the net effective tax rate for 2015 decreased to 35% from 42% in the prior year primarily due to the effects of recording valuation allowances in the united kingdom and deferred tax in the united states related to undistributed foreign earnings in 2014.
capital resources and liquidity cash flow the primary sources of cash for eog during the three-year period ended december 31, 2016, were funds generated from operations, net proceeds from issuances of long-term debt, proceeds from asset sales, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and net commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities.  the primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; repayments of debt; dividend payments to stockholders; and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans.
2016 compared to 2015.  net cash provided by operating activities of $2,359 million in 2016 decreased $1,236 million from $3,595 million in 2015 primarily reflecting a decrease in wellhead revenues ($907 million), an unfavorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($752 million), unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($197 million) and an increase in net cash paid for interest expense ($30 million), partially offset by a decrease in cash operating expenses ($442 million) and a decrease in net cash paid for income taxes ($80 million).
net cash used in investing activities of $1,253 million in 2016 decreased by $4,067 million from $5,320 million in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties ($2,235 million); an increase in proceeds from asset sales ($926 million); favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($656 million); a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($195 million); and net cash received from the yates transaction ($55 million).
net cash used for financing activities of $243 million in 2016 included repayments of long-term debt ($564 million), cash dividend payments ($373 million), net commercial paper repayments ($260 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($82 million). cash provided by financing activities in 2016 included net proceeds from the issuance of the notes ($991 million), excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($29 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($23 million).
2015 compared to 2014.  net cash provided by operating activities of $3,595 million in 2015 decreased $5,054 million from $8,649 million in 2014 primarily reflecting a decrease in wellhead revenues ($6,188 million), unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($591 million) and an increase in net cash paid for interest expense ($25 million), partially offset by a decrease in cash operating expenses ($741 million), a favorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($696 million) and a decrease in net cash paid for income taxes ($302 million).
net cash used in investing activities of $5,320 million in 2015 decreased by $2,194 million from $7,514 million in 2014 primarily due to a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties ($2,795 million); and a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($439 million); partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($603 million); a decrease in proceeds from sales of assets ($377 million) and the release of restricted cash in 2014 ($60 million).
net cash provided by financing activities of $371 million in 2015 included net proceeds from the issuance of the notes ($990 million), net commercial paper borrowings ($260 million), excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($26 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($23 million). cash used in financing activities in 2015 included repayments of long-term debt ($500 million), cash dividend payments ($367 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($49 million).
total expenditures the table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):
expenditure category capital exploration and development drilling                $1,957              $3,289              $5,543
facilities                                             375                 765               1,367

exploration and development expenditures             6,465               4,875               7,709
total exploration and development expenditures       6,445               4,928               7,905
total expenditures                                  $6,554              $5,216              $8,632
(1)   leasehold acquisitions included $3,115 million in 2016 related to the yates transaction and $5 million in 2014 related to non-cash property exchanges.
(2)   property acquisitions included $735 million in 2016 related to the yates transaction.
exploration and development expenditures of $6,465 million for 2016 were $1,590 million higher than the prior year. the increase was primarily due to increased leasehold acquisitions ($3,083 million) and increased property acquisitions ($268 million), partially offset by decreased exploration and development drilling expenditures in the united states ($1,280 million), trinidad ($46 million) and other international ($6 million); decreased facilities expenditures ($390 million); decreased geological and geophysical expenditures ($15 million); and decreased capitalized interest ($11 million). the 2016 exploration and development expenditures of $6,465 million included $3,351 million in exploration, $2,334 million in development drilling and facilities, $749 million in property acquisitions and $31 million in capitalized interest. the 2015 exploration and development expenditures of $4,875 million included $4,007 million in development drilling and facilities, $481 million in property acquisitions, $345 million in exploration and $42 million in capitalized interest. the 2014 exploration and development expenditures of $7,709 million included $6,804 million in development drilling and facilities, $709 million in exploration, $139 million in property acquisitions and $57 million in capitalized interest.
the level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors.  eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant.  while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog.

financing eog's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 33% at december 31, 2016, compared to 34% at december 31, 2015.  as used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity.
during 2016, eog funded its capital program primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of the notes, proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program.  while eog maintains a $2.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2016 was $604 million, and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero.  there were no amounts outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2016. the average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the uncommitted credit facilities were $130 million and zero, respectively, during the year 2016.  eog considers this excess availability, which is backed by its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility described in note 2 to consolidated financial statements, to be sufficient to meet its ongoing operating needs.

(1)   this table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, eog's pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see notes 6, 7 and 15, respectively, to consolidated financial statements).
(2)   amounts shown are based on current transportation and storage rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert canadian dollars and british pounds into united states dollars at december 31, 2016. management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of eog.
(3)   amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. eog's expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent eog utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if eog utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment (for example, pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract).
off-balance sheet arrangements eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships.  such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (vie) or special purpose entities (spe), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions or any other "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of regulation s-k) during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future.
foreign currency exchange rate risk during 2016, eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including trinidad, the united kingdom, china, canada and argentina.  the foreign currency most significant to eog's operations during 2016 was the british pound.  eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk.
outlook pricing.  crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue.  as a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment, worldwide supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, ngl and natural gas, the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, ngls, natural gas, ammonia and methanol prices in the future.  the market price of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas in 2017 will impact the amount of cash generated from eog's operating activities, which will in turn impact eog's financial position. as of february 17, 2017, the average 2017 nymex crude oil and natural gas prices were $54.16 per barrel and $3.19 per mmbtu, respectively, representing increases of 25% and 31%, respectively, from the average nymex prices in 2016. see item 1a, risk factors.
including the impact of eog's 2017 crude oil derivative contracts (exclusive of options) and based on eog's tax position, eog's price sensitivity in 2017 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the estimated change in ngl price, is approximately $77 million for net income and $96 million for cash flows from operating activities.  including the impact of eog's 2017 natural gas derivative contracts (exclusive of options) and based on eog's tax position and the portion of eog's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2017 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, eog's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $12 million for net income and $15 million for cash flows from operating activities.  for information regarding eog's crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts through february 20, 2017, see "derivative transactions" above.
capital. eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states. in particular, eog will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activity in its eagle ford, delaware basin and rocky mountain area where it generates its highest rates-of-return. to further enhance the economics of these plays, eog expects to continue to improve well performance and lower drilling and completion costs through efficiency gains and lower service costs.
the total anticipated 2017 capital expenditures of approximately $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, excluding acquisitions, is structured to maintain eog's strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration, development and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows and cash on hand. eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings.
summary of critical accounting policies eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.  eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of eog's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their application.  critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown.  management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies.  following is a discussion of eog's most critical accounting policies:
proved oil and gas reserves eog's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with united states securities and exchange commission (sec) regulations, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties and related assets.  proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, ngls and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made.  the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.  the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.  consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time.  for related discussion, see item 1a, risk factors, and "supplemental information to consolidated financial statements."
oil and gas exploration costs eog accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting.  oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred.  the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether eog has discovered proved commercial reserves.  if proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed.  in some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed.  such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made.  costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized.
depreciation, depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of eog's calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease, respectively.
depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method.  the reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves.  with respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves.  estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account.
oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the extractive industries - oil and gas topic of the asc.  the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field.
depreciation, depletion and amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs, reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, property acquisitions and/or property dispositions and impairments.
impairments oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred.  unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term.  if the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties.  lease rentals are expensed as incurred.
when circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation, depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset.  if the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on eog's estimates of (and assumptions regarding) future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, development expenditures, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value.  fair value is generally calculated using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the asc.  in certain instances, eog utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value.  estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment, and the assumptions used in preparing such estimates are inherently uncertain. in addition, such assumptions and estimates are reasonably likely to change in the future.
crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and eog expects that volatility to continue in the future.  during the five years ended december 31, 2016, west texas intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately $26.19 per barrel to $110.62 per barrel, and henry hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately $1.49 per mmbtu to $8.15 per mmbtu.  eog uses the five-year nymex futures strip for west texas intermediate crude oil and henry hub natural gas (in each case as of the applicable balance sheet date) as a basis to estimate future crude oil and natural gas prices. eog's proved reserves estimates, including the timing of future production, are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment, and are frequently revised (upwards and downwards) as more information becomes available.  proved reserves are estimated using a trailing 12-month average price, in accordance with sec rules. in the future, if any combination of crude oil, natural gas prices, actual production or operating costs diverge negatively from eog's current estimates, impairment charges and downward adjustments to our proved reserves may be necessary.
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach.  under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.  eog assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate.  significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and changes in tax rates.  changes in such assumptions could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances.
stock-based compensation in accounting for stock-based compensation, judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. assumptions regarding expected volatility of eog's common stock, the level of risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yields on eog's common stock, the expected term of the awards, expected volatility of the price of shares of eog's peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change. any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. in addition, please see "information regarding non-gaap measures" below, regarding important information on non-gaap financial measures contained in our discussion and analysis.
we are a diversified insurance agency, wholesale brokerage, insurance programs and services organization headquartered in daytona beach, florida. as an insurance intermediary, our principal sources of revenue are commissions paid by insurance companies and, to a lesser extent, fees paid directly by customers. commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds' underlying "insurable exposure units," which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk (such as property values, or sales and payroll levels) to determine what premium to charge the insured. insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors, including loss experience, risk profile and reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies, none of which we control.
we have increased revenues every year from 1993 to 2016, with the exception of 2009, when our revenues dropped 1.0%. our revenues grew from $95.6 million in 1993 to $1.8 billion in 2016, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 13.5%. in the same 23-year period, we increased net income from $8.1 million to $257.5 million in 2016, a compound annual growth rate of 16.2%.
the volume of business from new and existing customers, fluctuations in insurable exposure units, changes in premium rate levels, and changes in general economic and competitive conditions all affect our revenues. for example, level rates of inflation or a general decline in economic activity could limit increases in the values of insurable exposure units. conversely, increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards could cause some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage. historically, our revenues have typically grown as a result of our focus on net new business growth and acquisitions. we foster a strong, decentralized sales and service culture with the goal of consistent, sustained growth over the long-term.
the term "organic revenue", a non-gaap measure, is our core commissions and fees less (i) the core commissions and fees earned for the first twelve months by newly-acquired operations and (ii) divested business (core commissions and fees generated from offices, books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period). the term "core commissions and fees" excludes profit-sharing contingent commissions and guaranteed supplemental commissions, and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold, and specific fee-based services rendered. "organic revenue" is reported in this manner in order to express the current year's core commissions and fees on a comparable basis with the prior year's core commissions and fees. the resulting net change reflects the aggregate changes attributable to (i) net new and lost accounts, (ii) net changes in our customers' exposure units, (iii) net changes in insurance premium rates or the commission rate paid to us by our carrier partners; and (iv) the net change in fees paid to us by our customers. organic revenue is reported in the results of operations and in the results of operations - segment sections of this form 10-k.
we also earn "profit-sharing contingent commissions," which are profit-sharing commissions based primarily on underwriting results, but which may also reflect considerations for volume, growth and/or retention. these commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year, based upon the aforementioned considerations for the prior year(s). over the last three years, profit-sharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 3.6% of the previous year's total commissions and fees revenue. profit-sharing contingent commissions are included in our total commissions and fees in the consolidated statement of income in the year received.
certain insurance companies offer guaranteed fixed-base agreements, referred to as "guaranteed supplemental commissions" ("gscs") in lieu of profit-sharing contingent commissions. since gscs are not subject to the uncertainty of loss ratios, they are accrued throughout the year based upon actual premiums written. for the year ended december 31, 2016, we had earned $11.5 million of gscs, of which $9.2 million remained accrued at december 31, 2016 as most of this will be collected in the first quarter of 2017. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we earned $11.5 million, $10.0 million and $9.9 million, respectively, from gscs.
fee revenues relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions, which are recognized as services are rendered. fee revenues have historically been generated primarily by: (1) our services segment, which provides insurance-related services, including third-party claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers' compensation and all-lines liability arenas, as well as medicare set-aside services, social security disability and medicare benefits advocacy services, and claims adjusting services; (2) our national programs and wholesale brokerage segments, which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance companies and to a lesser extent (3) our retail segment in our large-account customer base. our services are provided over a period of time, which is typically one year. fee revenues, on a consolidated basis, as a percentage of our total commissions and fees, represented 31.3% in 2016, 30.6% in 2015 and 30.6% in 2014.
additionally, our profit-sharing contingent commissions and gscs for the year ended december 31, 2016 increased by $3.7 million over 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in profit-sharing contingent commissions and gscs in the retail segment, partially offset by a decrease in profit-sharing contingent commissions in the wholesale brokerage segment as a result of increased loss ratios. other income decreased by $0.2 million primarily as a result of a reduction in the gains on the sale of books of business when compared to 2015 and the change in where this activity is presented in the financial statements as described in the results of operations section below.
for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, our consolidated organic revenue growth rate was 3.0% and 2.6% respectively. additionally, each of our four segments recorded positive organic revenue growth for the year ended december 31, 2016. in the event that the gradual increases in insurable exposure units that occurred in the past few years continues through 2017 and premium rate changes are similar with 2016, we believe we will continue to see positive quarterly organic revenue growth rates in 2017.
historically, investment income has consisted primarily of interest earnings on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies. our policy is to invest available funds in high-quality, short-term fixed income investment securities. investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments. other income primarily reflects legal settlements and other miscellaneous income.
income before income taxes for the years ended december 31, 2016 increased over 2015 by $20.9 million, primarily as a result of acquisitions completed in the past twelve months and net new business.
information regarding non-gaap measures in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations, in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with gaap, we provide information regarding the following non-gaap measures: organic revenue, organic revenue growth, and organic revenue growth after adjusting for the significant revenue recorded at our former colonial claims operation in the first half of 2013 attributable to superstorm sandy ("2014 total core commissions and fees-adjusted"). we view each of these non-gaap measures as important indicators when assessing and evaluating our performance on a consolidated basis and for each of our segments because they allow us to determine a comparable, but non-gaap, measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year and that are expected to continue in the future.  these measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to the gaap information provided in this annual report on form 10-k. we believe that presenting these non-gaap measures allows readers of our financial statements to measure, analyze and compare our consolidated growth, and the growth of each of our segments, in a meaningful and consistent manner. we present such non-gaap supplemental financial information, as we believe such information provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of our operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a gaap basis. our industry peers may provide similar supplemental non-gaap information with respect to one or more of these measures, although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments. this supplemental financial information should be considered in addition to, not in lieu of, our consolidated financial statements.
tabular reconciliations of this supplemental non-gaap financial information to our most comparable gaap information are contained in this annual report on form 10-k under "results of operation - segment information."
acquisitions part of our continuing business strategy is to attract high-quality insurance intermediaries to join our operations. from 1993 through the fourth quarter of 2016, we acquired 479 insurance intermediary operations, excluding acquired books of business (customer accounts). during the year ended december 31, 2016, the company acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of seven insurance intermediaries, all of the stock of one insurance intermediary and three books of business (customer accounts). collectively, these acquired business that had annualized revenues of approximately $56 million.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. we continually evaluate our estimates, which are based upon historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities, of which values are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates.
we believe that of our significant accounting and reporting policies, the more critical policies include our accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations and purchase price allocations, intangible asset impairments, non-cash stock-based compensation and reserves for litigation. in particular, the accounting for these areas requires significant use of judgment to be made by management. different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. refer to note 1 in the "notes to consolidated financial statements".
revenue recognition commission revenues are recognized as of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date on which the policy premium is processed into our systems and invoiced to the customer, whichever is later. commission revenues related to installment billings are recognized on the later of the date effective or invoiced, with the exception of our arrowhead business which follows a policy of recognizing on the later of the date effective or processed into our systems regardless of the billing arrangement. management determines the policy cancellation reserve based upon historical cancellation experience adjusted in accordance with known circumstances. subsequent commission adjustments are recognized upon our receipt of notification from insurance companies concerning matters necessitating such adjustments. profit-sharing
contingent commissions are recognized when determinable, which is generally when such commissions are received from insurance companies, or periodically when we receive formal notification of the amount of such payments. fee revenues, and commissions for employee benefits coverages and workers' compensation programs, are recognized as services are rendered.
business combinations and purchase price allocations we have acquired significant intangible assets through business acquisitions. these assets consist of purchased customer accounts, non-compete agreements, and the excess of purchase prices over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired (goodwill). the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges.
all of our business combinations initiated after june 30, 2001 have been accounted for using the acquisition method. in connection with these acquisitions, we record the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased, which typically consist of purchased customer accounts and non-compete agreements. purchased customer accounts include the physical records and files obtained from acquired businesses that contain information about insurance policies, customers and other matters essential to policy renewals. however, they primarily represent the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over the estimated future renewal periods of the insurance policies comprising those purchased customer accounts. the valuation of purchased customer accounts involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency, expenses and discount rates. any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of purchased customer accounts. non-compete agreements are valued based upon their duration and any unique features of the particular agreements. purchased customer accounts and non-compete agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the related estimated lives and contract periods, which range from 3 to 15 years. the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill and is not amortized.
acquisition purchase prices are typically based upon a multiple of average annual operating profit earned over a one to three-year period within a minimum and maximum price range. the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions consummated after january 1, 2009 include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earn-out provisions. subsequent changes in the fair value of earn-out obligations are recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred.
the fair value of earn-out obligations is based upon the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions contained in the respective purchase agreements. in determining fair value, the acquired business's future performance is estimated using financial projections developed by management for the acquired business and this estimate reflects market participant assumptions regarding revenue growth and/or profitability. the expected future payments are estimated on the basis of the earn-out formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement compared to the associated financial projections. these estimates are then discounted to a present value using a risk-adjusted rate that takes into consideration the likelihood that the forecasted earn-out payments will be made.
intangible assets impairment goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment measured by a fair-value-based test. amortizable intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to an impairment review based upon an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets. to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. fair value is estimated based upon multiples of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables ("ebitdac"), or on a discounted cash flow basis.
management assesses the recoverability of our goodwill and our amortizable intangibles and other long-lived assets annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. any of the following factors, if present, may trigger an impairment review: (i) a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; (ii) a significant negative industry or economic trend; and (iii) a significant decline in our market capitalization. if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above-referenced factors, an impairment analysis is performed. management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets. if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to revise the assessment and, if appropriate, record an impairment charge. we completed our most recent evaluation of impairment for goodwill as of november 30, 2016 and determined that the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value of such assets. additionally, there have been no impairments recorded for amortizable intangible assets for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
non-cash stock-based compensation we grant non-vested stock awards, and to a lesser extent, stock options to our employees, with the related compensation expense recognized in the financial statements over the associated service period based upon the grant-date fair value of those awards.
during the first quarter of 2016, the performance conditions for approximately 1.4 million shares of the company's common stock granted under the company's stock incentive plan were determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to performance-based grants issued in 2011. these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on december 31, 2015.  the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to ten years from the january 2011 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable.  as a result of the awarding of these shares, the grantees became eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges after the awarding date.
during the first quarter of 2017, the performance conditions for approximately 169,000 shares of the company's common stock granted under the company's stock incentive plan were determined by the compensation committee to have been satisfied relative to performance-based grants issued in 2012. these grants had a performance measurement period that concluded on december 31, 2016.  the vesting condition for these grants requires continuous employment for a period of up to ten years from the january 2012 grant date in order for the awarded shares to become fully vested and nonforfeitable.  as a result of the awarding of these shares, the grantees will be eligible to receive payments of dividends and exercise voting privileges after the awarding date, and the awarded shares will be included as issued and outstanding common stock shares and included in the calculation of basic and diluted eps.
litigation and claims we are subject to numerous litigation claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. if it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimable, an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. professional fees related to these claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income as incurred. management, with the assistance of in-house and outside counsel, determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss based upon analysis of individual issues. new developments or changes in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters may significantly affect the required reserves and affect our net income.
results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014
the following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes.

(1) a non-gaap measure nmf = not a meaningful figure commissions and fees commissions and fees, including profit-sharing contingent commissions and gscs for 2016, increased $105.8 million to $1,762.8 million, or 6.4% over 2015. core commissions and fees revenue for 2016 increased $102.1 million, of which approximately $61.7 million represented core commissions and fees from agencies acquired since 2015 that had no comparable revenues. after accounting for divested business of $6.6 million, the remaining net increase of $47.0 million represented net new business, which reflects a growth rate of 3.0% for core organic commissions and fees. profit-sharing contingent commissions and gscs for 2016 increased by $3.7 million, or 6.1%, compared to the same period in 2015. the net increase of $3.7 million was mainly driven by an increase in profit-sharing contingent commissions and gscs in the retail segment, partially offset by a decrease in profit-sharing contingent commissions in the wholesale brokerage segment as a result of increased loss ratios.
commissions and fees, including profit-sharing contingent commissions and gscs for 2015, increased $89.5 million to $1,657.0 million, or 5.7% over the same period in 2014. core commissions and fees revenue in 2015 increased $95.3 million, of which approximately $76.6 million represented core commissions and fees from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2014. after accounting for divested business of $19.3 million, the remaining net increase of $38.0 million represented net new business, which reflects a growth rate of 2.6% for core organic commissions and fees. profit-sharing contingent commissions and gscs for 2015 decreased by $5.8 million, or 8.6%, compared
to the same period in 2014. the net decrease of $5.8 million was mainly driven by a decrease in profit-sharing contingent commissions in the national programs segment as a result of increased loss ratios.
investment income investment income increased to $1.5 million in 2016, compared with $1.0 million in 2015 due to additional interest income driven by higher average invested cash balances. investment income increased to $1.0 million in 2015, compared with $0.7 million in 2014 due to additional interest income driven by cash management activities to earn a higher yield.
other income, net other income for 2016 was $2.4 million, compared with $2.6 million in 2015 and $7.6 million in 2014. other income consists primarily of legal settlements and other miscellaneous income for 2016 and 2015. in 2014, other income included legal settlements and gains and loss on the sale and disposition of fixed assets as well as gains and losses from the sale on books of business (customer accounts). prior to the adoption of asu no. 2014-08, "reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity" ("asu 2014-08") in the fourth quarter of 2014, net gains and losses on the sale of businesses or customer accounts were reflected in other income. any such gains or losses are now reflected on a net basis in the expense section since the adoption of asu 2014-08. we recognized gains of $1.3 million, $0.6 million and $5.3 million from sales on books of business (customer accounts) in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits expense increased 8.0%, or $68.3 million, in 2016 over 2015. this increase included $23.3 million of compensation costs related to stand-alone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2015. therefore, employee compensation and benefits expense attributable to those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2016 and 2015 increased by $45.0 million or 5.2%. this underlying employee compensation and benefits expense increase was primarily related to (i) an increase in producer commissions correlated to increased revenue; (ii) increased staff salaries that included severance cost; (iii) increased profit center bonuses due to increased revenue and operating profit; (iv) the increased cost of health insurance; and (v) an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense due to forfeiture credits recognized in 2015. employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 52.4% for 2016 as compared to 51.6% for the year ended december 31, 2015.
employee compensation and benefits expense increased, 5.7% or $45.8 million in 2015 over 2014. this increase included $26.3 million of compensation costs related to new acquisitions that were stand-alone offices. therefore, employee compensation and benefits from those offices that existed in the same time periods of 2015 and 2014 increased by $19.5 million or 4.3%. this underlying employee compensation and benefits expense increase was primarily related to (i) an increase in producer and staff salaries as we made targeted investments in our business; (ii) increased profit center bonuses and commissions due to increased revenue and operating profit; and (iii) the increased cost of health insurance. employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues was 51.6% for 2015 as compared to 51.5% for the year ended december 31, 2014.
other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues, other operating expenses represented 14.9% in 2016, 15.1% in 2015, and 14.9% in 2014. other operating expenses in 2016 increased $11.8 million, or 4.7%, over 2015, of which $9.5 million was related to acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2015. the other operating expenses for those offices that existed in the same periods in both 2016 and 2015 increased by $2.3 million or 0.9%, which was primarily attributable to increased data processing related to the information technology spend for our multi-year investment program, partially offset by the receipt of certain premium tax refunds by our national flood program business.
as a percentage of total revenues, other operating expenses represented 15.1% in 2015, 14.9% in 2014, and 14.4% in 2013. other operating expenses in 2015 increased $15.7 million, or 6.7%, over 2014, of which $12.6 million was related to acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of 2014. the other operating expenses for those offices that existed in the same periods in both 2015 and 2014, increased by $3.1 million or 1.3%, which was primarily attributable to increased sales meetings, legal and consulting expenses, partially offset by decreases in expenses associated with office rent, telecommunications and bank fees.
gain or loss on disposal the company recognized a gain on disposal of $1.3 million and $0.6 million in 2016 and 2015 respectively, and a loss of $47.4 million in 2014. the pretax loss for 2014 is the result of the disposal of the axiom re business as part of the company's strategy to exit the reinsurance brokerage business. prior to the adoption of asu 2014-08 in the fourth quarter of 2014, net gains and losses on the sale of businesses or customer accounts were reflected in other income. although we are not in the business of selling customer accounts, we periodically sell an office or a book of business (one or more customer accounts) that we believe does not produce reasonable margins or demonstrate a potential for growth, or because doing so is in the company's best interest. in 2014 the company recognized $5.3 million in gains from sales on books of business (customer accounts) reported as other income.
amortization amortization expense decreased $0.8 million, or 0.9%, in 2016, and increased $4.5 million, or 5.5%, in 2015. the decrease for 2016 is a result of certain intangibles becoming fully amortized or otherwise written off as part of disposed businesses, partially offset with amortization of new intangibles from recently acquired businesses. the increase for 2015 is a result of the amortization of newly acquired intangibles being greater than the decrease associated with intangibles that became fully amortized or otherwise written off as part of disposed businesses during 2015.
depreciation depreciation expense increased $0.1 million, or 0.5%, in 2016 and remained flat in 2015. these changes were due primarily to the addition of fixed assets resulting from acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2016, net of assets which became fully depreciated. the increase in 2015 was due primarily to the addition of fixed assets resulting from acquisitions completed since 2014, while the stable level of expense in 2016 versus 2015 reflected capital additions approximately equal to the value of prior capital additions that became fully depreciated.
interest expense interest expense increased $0.2 million, or 0.6%, in 2016, and $10.8 million, or 38.2% in 2015. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to the increased debt borrowings and an increase in our effective rate of interest for the years ended 2015 and 2014. the increased debt borrowings from 2014 include: the credit facility term loan entered into in may 2014 in the initial amount of $550.0 million at libor plus 137.5 basis points, and the $500.0 million senior notes due 2024 issued in september 2014 at a fixed rate of interest of 4.200%. the credit facility term loan proceeds replaced pre-existing debt of $230.0 million with similar rates of interest. the proceeds from the senior notes due 2024 were used to settle the credit facility revolver debt of $375.0 million, which had a lower, but variable rate of interest based upon an adjusted libor. this transitioned the debt to a favorable long-term fixed rate of interest and extended the date of maturity of those funds. these changes were the result of an evolution and maturation of our previous debt structure and provide increased debt capacity and flexibility. the increase in 2016 versus 2015 is due to the rise in the floating interest rate of our credit facility term loan, partially offset by the scheduled amortized principal payments on the credit facility term loan which has reduced the company's average debt balance.
change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 805-business combinations is the authoritative guidance requiring an acquirer to recognize 100% of the fair value of acquired assets, including goodwill, and assumed liabilities (with only limited exceptions) upon initially obtaining control of an acquired entity. additionally, the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements (such as earn-out purchase price arrangements) at the acquisition date must be included in the purchase price consideration. as a result, the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions consummated after january 1, 2009 include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earn-out provisions. subsequent changes in these earn-out obligations are required to be recorded in the consolidated statement of income when incurred or reasonably estimated. estimations of potential earn-out obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired operations or entities, usually for periods ranging from one to three years.
the net charge or credit to the consolidated statement of income for the period is the combination of the net change in the estimated acquisition earn-out payables balance, and the interest expense imputed on the outstanding balance of the estimated acquisition earn-out payables.
as of december 31, 2016, the fair values of the estimated acquisition earn-out payables were re-evaluated and measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs (level 3) as defined in asc 820-fair value measurement. the resulting net changes, as well as the interest expense accretion on the estimated acquisition earn-out payables, for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were as follows:
change in fair value of estimated acquisition earn-out payables          $6,338                 $13              $7,375
net change in earnings from estimated acquisition earn-out payables      $9,185              $3,003              $9,938
for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of estimated earn-out payables was re-evaluated and increased by $6.3 million, $13.0 thousand and $7.4 million, respectively, which resulted in charges to the consolidated statement of income.
as of december 31, 2016, the estimated acquisition earn-out payables equaled $63.8 million, of which $31.8 million was recorded as accounts payable and $32.0 million was recorded as other non-current liability. as of december 31, 2015, the estimated acquisition earn-out payables equaled $78.4 million, of which $25.3 million was recorded as accounts payable and $53.1 million was recorded as other non-current liability.
income taxes the effective tax rate on income from operations was 39.2% in 2016, 39.6% in 2015, and 39.1% in 2014. the decrease in the effective tax rate is driven by several permanent tax differences along with the apportionment of taxable income in the states where we operate.
results of operations - segment information as discussed in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, we operate four reportable segments: retail, national programs, wholesale brokerage, and services. on a segmented basis, increases in amortization, depreciation and interest expenses generally result from completed acquisitions within a given segment within the preceding 12 months. likewise, other income in each segment reflects net gains primarily from legal settlements and miscellaneous income. as such, in evaluating the operational efficiency of a segment, management emphasizes the net organic revenue growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue, the ratio of total employee compensation and benefits to total revenues, and the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenues.
the reconciliation of total commissions and fees, included in the consolidated statement of income, to organic revenue for the years ended december 31, 2016, and 2015, is as follows:

(1)   the retail segment includes commissions and fees reported in the "other" column of the segment information in note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which includes corporate and consolidation items.
retail segment the retail segment provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial, public and quasi-public, professional and individual insured customers. approximately 85.7% of the retail segment's commissions and fees revenue is commission-based. because most of our other operating expenses are not correlated to changes in commissions on insurance premiums, a significant portion of any fluctuation in the commissions we receive, net of related producer compensation, will result in a similar fluctuation in our income before income taxes, unless we make incremental investments in the organization.

(1) a non-gaap measure nmf = not a meaningful figure the retail segment's total revenues in 2016 increased 5.4%, or $47.1 million, over the same period in 2015, to $917.4 million. the $44.3 million increase in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by the following: (i) approximately $31.2 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2015; (ii) $15.7 million related to net new business; and (iii) an offsetting decrease of $2.6 million related to commissions and fees revenue from business divested in 2015 and 2016. profit-sharing contingent commissions and gscs in 2016 increased 15.3%, or $4.7 million, over 2015, to $35.0 million. the retail segment's organic revenue growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was 1.9% for 2016 and was driven by revenue from net new business written during the preceding twelve months along with modest increases in commercial auto rates and underlying exposure unit values that drive insurance premiums, and partially offset by rate reductions in most lines of coverage, other than commercial auto, with the most pronounced declines realized for insurance premium rates for properties in catastrophe-prone areas.
income before income taxes for 2016 increased 3.3%, or $6.1 million, over the same period in 2015, to $188.0 million. this growth in income before income taxes was negatively impacted by $10.3 million in expense associated with the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables, an increase of $8.2 million over the same period in 2015. other factors affecting this increase were: (i) the net increase in revenue as described above; (ii) a 6.3%, or $29.0 million increase in employee compensation and benefits due primarily to the year on year impact of new teammates related to acquisitions completed in the past twelve months and to a lesser extent continued investment in producers and other staff to support current and future expected organic revenue growth; and (iii) operating expenses which increased by $8.8 million or 6.4%, primarily
due to increased value-added consulting services to support our customers and increases in office rent expense, offset by a combined decrease in amortization, depreciation and intercompany interest expense of $4.9 million.
the retail segment's total revenues in 2015 increased 5.7%, or $46.7 million, over the same period in 2014, to $870.3 million. the $43.6 million increase in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by the following: (i) approximately $35.6 million related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2014; (ii) $11.0 million related to net new business; and (iii) an offsetting decrease of $3.0 million related to commissions and fees revenue recorded from business divested in 2014 and 2015. profit-sharing contingent commissions and gscs in 2015 increased 3.4%, or $1.0 million, over 2014, to $30.3 million. the retail segment's organic revenue growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was 1.4% for 2015 and was driven by revenue from net new business written during the preceding twelve months along with modest increases in commercial auto rates, and partially offset by: (i) terminated association health plans in the state of washington; (ii) continued pressure on the small employee benefits business as some accounts adopt alternative plan designs and move to a per employee/per month payment model due to the implementation of the affordable care act; and (iii) reductions in property insurance premium rates specifically in catastrophe-prone areas.
income before income taxes for 2015 increased 15.5%, or $24.4 million, over the same period in 2014, to $181.9 million. the primary factors affecting this increase were: (i) the net increase in revenue as described above; (ii) a 7.1%, or $29.4 million increase in employee compensation and benefits due primarily to the year on year impact of new teammates related to acquisitions completed in the past twelve months in addition to incremental investments in revenue producing teammates; and (iii) operating expenses which increased by $3.8 million or 2.9%, due to increased travel and value added consulting services; offset by (iv) a reduction in the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables of $5.5 million, or 73.1% to $2.0 million; and (v) a $4.2 million, or 25.7% reduction in non-cash stock-based compensation to $12.1 million due to the forfeiture of certain grants where performance conditions were not fully achieved.
national programs segment the national programs segment manages over 50 programs with approximately 40 well-capitalized carrier partners. in most cases, the insurance carriers that support the programs have delegated underwriting and, in many instances, claims-handling authority to our programs operations. these programs are generally distributed through a nationwide network of independent agents and brown & brown retail agents, and offer targeted products and services designed for specific industries, trade groups, professions, public entities and market niches. the national programs segment operations can be grouped into five broad categories: professional programs, arrowhead insurance programs, commercial programs, public entity-related programs and the national flood program. the national programs segment's revenue is primarily commission-based.

(1) a non-gaap measure national programs total revenues in 2016 increased 4.6%, or $19.8 million, over 2015, to a total $448.5 million. the $17.6 million increase in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by the following: (i) an increase of approximately $1.7 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2015; and (ii) $17.2 million related to net new business offset by (iii) a decrease of $1.3 million related to commissions and fees revenue recorded in 2015 from businesses since divested. profit-sharing contingent commissions and gscs were $17.3 million in 2016, which was an increase of $1.7 million over 2015, which was primarily driven by the improved loss experience of our carrier partners.
the national programs segment's organic revenue growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue was 4.2% for 2016. this organic revenue growth rate was mainly due to increased flood claims revenues and the on-boarding of net new customers by our lender placed coverage program. growth in these businesses was partially offset by certain programs that have been affected by lower rates and certain carriers changing their risk appetite for new or existing programs.
income before income taxes for 2016 increased 35.6%, or $24.1 million, from the same period in 2015, to $91.8 million. the increase is the result of a lower intercompany interest charge of $10.0 million, the receipt of certain premium tax refunds by our national flood program business, along with revenue growth of $19.8 million.
the national programs segment's total revenues in 2015 increased 6.1%, or $24.5 million, over 2014, to a total of $428.7 million. the $36.4 million increase in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by the following: (i) an increase of approximately $38.5 million related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in 2014; (ii) $6.7 million related to net new business offset by (iii) a decrease of $8.8 million related to commissions and fees revenue recorded in 2014 from businesses since divested. profit-sharing contingent commissions and gscs were $15.6 million in 2015, a decrease of $5.3 million from the same period of 2014, which was primarily driven by the loss experience of our carrier partners.
the national programs segment's organic revenue growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue was 1.8% for 2015. this organic revenue growth rate was mainly due to the arrowhead personal property program, which continued to produce more written premium, the arrowhead automotive aftermarket program which received a commission rate increase from their carrier partner, growth in our wright specialty education program and the on-boarding of new customers by proctor financial. growth in these businesses was partially offset by certain programs that have been affected by lower rates.
income before income taxes for 2015 decreased 7.5%, or $5.5 million, from the same period in 2014, to $67.7 million. the decrease is the result of the $6.0 million gain on the sale of industry consulting group ("icg"), along with the $3.7 million sip grant forfeiture benefit associated with arrowhead, which were both credits recorded in 2014. after adjusting for these one-time items in 2014, underlying income before income taxes increased and was driven by the net revenue growth noted above and expense management initiatives as we grow and scale our programs.
wholesale brokerage segment the wholesale brokerage segment markets and sells excess and surplus commercial and personal lines insurance, primarily through independent agents and brokers, including brown & brown retail segment. like the retail and national programs segments, the wholesale brokerage segment's revenues are primarily commission-based.

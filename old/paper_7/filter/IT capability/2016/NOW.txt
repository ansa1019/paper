our billings and free cash flow measures included in the sections entitled "-key business metrics-billings," "-key business metrics-free cash flow," and "-seasonality, cyclicality and quarterly trends" are not in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). these non-gaap financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. these measures may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. we believe investors should consider these non-gaap financial measures in evaluating our results as they are indicative of our ongoing performance and reflect how management evaluates our operational results and trends.
overview servicenow is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions that define, structure, manage and automate services for global enterprises. our mission is to help our customers improve service levels and reduce costs while scaling and automating their businesses. we offer our services on an annual subscription fee basis which includes access to the ordered subscription service and related support including updates to the subscribed service during the subscription term. we provide a scaled pricing model based on the duration of the subscription term and we frequently extend discounts to our customers based on the number of users. we generate sales through our direct sales team and, to a lesser extent, indirectly through channel partners and third-party referrals. we also generate revenues from professional services for implementation and configuration services and for training of customer and partner personnel. we generally bill our customers annually in advance for subscription services and monthly in arrears for our professional services as the work is performed.
a majority of our revenues come from large global enterprise customers. we continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth. we increased our overall employee headcount to 4,801 as of december 31, 2016 from 3,686 as of december 31, 2015.
key business metrics number of customers with acv greater than $1 million. we count the total number of customers with annualized contract value (acv) greater than $1 million as of the end of the period. we had 341, 227 and 157 customers with acv greater than $1 million as of december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. for purposes of customer count, a customer is defined as an entity with a unique dunn & bradstreet global ultimate (gult), data universal numbering system (duns) and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. the duns number is a global standard for business identification and tracking. we make exceptions for holding companies, government entities and other organizations for which the gult, in our judgment, does not accurately represent the servicenow customer. for example, while all u.s. government agencies roll up to "government of the united states" under the gult, we count each government agency that we contract with as a separate customer. our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, spin-offs and other market activity. previously disclosed number of customers with acv greater than $1 million as well as our average contract term calculations are restated to allow for comparability. acv is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was entered into. foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause some variability in the number of customers with acv greater than $1 million.
g2k customer count. the global 2000 (g2k) customer count is defined as the total number of g2k companies in our customer base as of the end of the period. the forbes global 2000 is an annual ranking of the top 2,000 public companies in the world by forbes magazine. the ranking is based on a mix of four metrics: sales, profit, assets, and market value. the forbes global 2000 is updated annually in the second quarter of the calendar year. current and prior period g2k customer counts are based on the most recent list for comparability purposes. we adjust the g2k count for acquisitions, spin-offs and other market activity to ensure the g2k customer count is accurately captured. for example, we add a g2k customer when a g2k company that is not our customer acquires a company in our existing customer base that is not a g2k company. when we enter into a contract with a g2k parent company, or any of its related subsidiaries, or any combination of entities within a g2k company, we count only one g2k customer. we do not count further penetration into entities within a given g2k as a new customer in the g2k customer count. our g2k customer count also excludes customers that have only purchased our express product offering, which is our entry-level it service management solution.
our g2k customer count was 735, 633 and 533 as of december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
average acv per g2k customer. we calculate average acv for our g2k customers by taking cumulative acv from g2k customers as of the end of the period divided by cumulative count of g2k customers as of the end of the period. foreign currency rate fluctuations could cause variability in the average acv per g2k customer. our average acv per g2k customer was approximately $1.1 million, $0.9 million and $0.7 million as of december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
renewal rate. we calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100%. our attrition rate for a period is equal to the acv from lost customers, divided by the total acv from all customers that renewed during the period, excluding changes in price or users, and total acv from all lost customers. accordingly, our renewal rate is a calculation based on acv and is not based on the number of customers that have renewed. a lost customer is a customer that did not renew an expiring contract and that, in our judgment, will not be renewed. typically, a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer. however, in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customer's acv, we may deem the renewal as a lost customer. for our renewal rate calculation, we define a customer as an entity with a separate production instance of our service and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date, instead of an entity with a unique gult or duns number. our renewal rate was 98% for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 and 97% for the year ended december 31, 2014. as renewal rate is impacted by the timing of renewals, which could occur in advance of, or subsequent to the original contract end date, period-to-period comparison of renewal rates may not be meaningful.
billings. we define billings as revenue recognized plus the change in total deferred revenue as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows. the change in total deferred revenue as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows represent the change in deferred revenues in local currencies translated into u.s. dollars using an average foreign currency exchange rate, and aligns actual billings with the exchange rates in effect at the time of the billings. we believe billings is a useful leading indicator regarding the performance of our business.
change in deferred revenue from the consolidated statements of cash flows         300,167                   195,900                 168,393
year-over-year percentage change in total billings                                     41    %   41                    %                 64    %
billings consists of amounts invoiced for contracts with new customers, upsells, renewals, backlog, professional services, training, and our knowledge and other customer forum events. while we typically bill customers annually for our subscription services, customers sometimes request, and we accommodate, billings durations that differ from the typical twelve month term. in addition, from time to time we enter into contracts with a contract start date in the future, and we exclude these amounts from billings as these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets, unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date. factors such as the weighted average billings duration, the timing of contract start dates and timing of collections create variability in billings. accordingly, while we believe billings is a useful leading indicator regarding the performance of our business, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in a reporting period may not have an immediately apparent impact on billings for that reporting period due to factors that may offset the decline, such as an increase in billings duration, a decline in the dollar value of contracts with future start dates and an increase in collections in the current period related to contracts with future start dates.
to facilitate greater year-over-year comparability in our billings information, we disclose the impact that foreign currency rate fluctuations and fluctuations in billings duration had on our billings. the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations is calculated by translating the current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than u.s. dollars into u.s. dollars at the exchange rates in effect during the prior period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period. the impact of fluctuations in billings duration is calculated by applying the weighted average billings duration in effect during the prior period presented rather than the actual weighted average billings duration in effect during the current period. weighted average billings duration refers to the weighted average billings duration for all our customer contracts commencing during the period, unless such amounts have been paid during the period. although we believe these adjustments improve comparability of our billings information from period to period, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in a reporting period may not have an immediately apparent impact on billings for that reporting period due to factors that may offset the decline, such as a decline in the dollar value of contracts with future start dates and an increase in collections in the current period related to contracts with future start dates.
foreign currency rate fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $8.4 million and $74.3 million on billings for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. changes in weighted average billings duration had a favorable impact of $24.6 million and $1.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively.
free cash flow. we define free cash flow, a non-gaap financial measure, as gaap net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment. we believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our business operations. however, our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. in addition, free cash flow is impacted by the timing of collections and disbursements, including the timing of capital expenditures. a calculation of free cash flow is provided below:
net cash provided by operating activities (1)      $159,921                $317,754                $140,937
(1) during the year ended december 31, 2016, we early adopted accounting standards update 2016-09, "compensation-stock compensation (topic 718): improvements to employee share-based payment accounting." refer to note 2 recent accounting pronouncements for further details. this adoption resulted in a $2.7 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding $2.7 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2015, and a $2.0 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding $2.0 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to the amounts previously reported.
(2) free cash flow includes the effect of a $267.5 million payment for aggregate legal settlements for the year ended december 31, 2016. refer to note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further details.
average contract term. we calculate the average contract term for new customers, upsells and renewals based on the term of those contracts entered into during the period weighted by their acv. the average new customer contract term was 32 months for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. the average upsell contract term was 26 months for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, and 25 months for the year ended december 31, 2014. the average renewal contract term was 28 months,  months, and  months for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
components of results of operations revenues subscription revenues. subscription revenues are primarily comprised of fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and upgrades, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term. pricing includes multiple instances, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future upgrades, when and if available, offered during the subscription term. we typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal. our contracts are generally non-cancelable during the subscription term, though a customer can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform.
professional services and other revenues. professional services revenues consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription service. our arrangements for professional services are primarily on a time-and-materials basis. we generally invoice our professional services monthly in arrears based on actual hours and expenses incurred. other revenues primarily include fees from customer training delivered on-site or publicly available classes, attendance and sponsorship fees for our annual knowledge user conference and other customer forums. typical payment terms require our customers to pay us within 30 days of invoice.
we generate sales directly through our sales team and, to a lesser extent, through our channel partners. revenues from our direct sales organization represented 88%, 89%, and 87% of our total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we make sales to our channel partners at a discount and record those revenues at the discounted price when all revenue recognition criteria are met. from time to time, our channel partners and other third parties provide us referrals for which we pay a referral fee between 5% and 15% of the customer's acv, depending on the level of activity the partner performs in the sales process. we include these fees in sales and marketing expense.
allocation of overhead costs overhead costs associated with office facilities, it and certain depreciation related to infrastructure that is not dedicated for customer use or research and development use are allocated to cost of revenues and operating expenses based on headcount.
cost of revenues cost of subscription revenues. cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our services and providing support to our customers. these expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs, which includes facility costs associated with our data centers as well as interconnectivity between data centers, depreciation related to our cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment dedicated for customer use, amortization of intangible assets and personnel related costs directly associated with our cloud-based infrastructure and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead.
cost of professional services and other revenues. cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, the costs of contracted third-party partners, travel expenses and allocated overhead.
professional services associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription services are performed directly by our services team, as well as by contracted third-party partners. fees paid to third-party partners are primarily recognized as cost of revenues as the professional services are delivered. cost of revenues associated with our professional services engagements contracted with third-party partners as a percentage of professional services and other revenues was 19%, 20% and 17% for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses directly associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, commissions and stock-based compensation. sales and marketing expenses also include third-party referral fees, expenses related to our annual knowledge user conference, other marketing program expenses, which includes events, advertising and market data, and allocated overhead.
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses directly associated with our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. research and development expenses also include data center capacity costs, amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment that are used solely for research and development purposes.
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, facility and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, external legal, accounting and other professional services fees, other corporate expenses, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead.
legal settlements legal settlements consist of one-time aggregate charges related to the settlement agreements with hewlett packard enterprise company (hpe) and bmc software, inc. (bmc). refer to note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further details of these matters.
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. due to cumulative losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against our u.s. deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2016 and 2015. we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to earnings history, projected future outcomes, industry and market trends and the nature of each of the deferred tax assets in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our u.s. deferred tax assets.

revenues year ended december 31,          % change
subscription revenues increased $373.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the prior year, driven by upsells and an increase in customer count. we expect subscription revenues to grow in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in the year ended december 31, 2017 as we continue to add new customers and upsell to existing customers. our expectations for 2017 revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses was based on foreign exchange rates as of december 31, 2016.
year ended december 31,          % change
service management solutions            $1,108,846                  $783,603               42      %
it operations management solutions         112,793                    64,675               74      %
our service management solutions include servicenow platform, it service management, it business management, customer service, human resources and security operations, which have similar features and functions and are generally priced on a per user basis. our it operations management solutions, which improve visibility, availability and agility of enterprise services, are generally priced on a per node basis.
professional services and other revenues increased $11.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in the services provided to our growing customer base. in addition, revenues from our annual knowledge user conference increased to $12.8 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $10.9 million in the prior year due to increased sponsorship and paid registrations in the current year. we expect professional services and other revenues to grow at a slower rate compared to subscription revenues as we are increasingly focused on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource and relying on our partner ecosystem to contract directly with customers for service delivery.
our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues. revenues outside north america represented 32% and 30% of total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. as a result, the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily euro) from the year ended december 31, 2015 to the year ended december 31, 2016 had an unfavorable impact on our revenues. for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31, 2016 at the exchange rates for the year ended december 31, 2015 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our subscription revenues would have increased by an additional $6.3 million. the impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended december 31, 2015 to the year ended december 31, 2016 is not material to professional services and other revenues.
cost of revenues and gross profit percentage year ended december 31,          % change
gross profit percentage:
total gross profit percentage              71     %                  67     %
gross profit:                        $991,831                  $676,067               47      %
cost of subscription revenues increased $52.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $17.3 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $5.0 million in stock-based compensation, and an increase of $7.2 million in other overhead expenses. in addition, there was an increase of $10.3 million in depreciation expense primarily due to purchases of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment for our data centers, an increase of $5.3 million in data center capacity costs primarily due to the expansion of our data centers, and an increase of $1.5 million in amortization of intangible assets as a result of acquisitions in 2016.
our subscription gross profit percentage increased to 81% for the year ended december 31, 2016, from 78% for the year ended december 31, 2015, due to improved data center utilization and economies of scale. we expect our cost of subscription revenues to increase in absolute dollar terms as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase the number of users within our customer instances, but we expect such increase to be at a slower rate than the increase in our subscription revenue, leading to a slight increase in our subscription gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31, 2017 as we continue to leverage the investments we have made in our existing data center infrastructure. to the extent future acquisitions are consummated, our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional non-cash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired.
cost of professional services and other revenues increased $17.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $8.0 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $3.2 million in stock-based compensation, and an increase of $3.4 million in overhead expenses.
our professional services and other gross profit percentage decreased to 3% during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 7% in the prior year due to lower utilization rates as we invest in specialized resources to support our newer products and higher growth rate in our stock-based compensation of 14% compared to the growth rate in our professional services and other revenues of 7%, partially offset by the increase in revenues from our annual knowledge user conference. costs associated with knowledge are included in sales and marketing expense. knowledge contributed $12.8 million, or 8 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31, 2016. knowledge contributed $10.9 million, or 7 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31, 2015. we expect cost of professional services and other revenues to increase in absolute dollars as our business grows, but we expect such increase to be at a slower rate than the increase in professional services and other revenues, leading to an increase in professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31, 2017.
the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended december 31, 2015 to the year ended december 31, 2016 had a favorable impact on our cost of revenues. for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31, 2016 at the exchange rates for the year ended december 31, 2015 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the year ended december 31, 2016, our cost of subscription revenues would have increased by an additional $3.3 million and our cost of professional services and other revenues would have increased by an additional $1.6 million.
sales and marketing year ended december 31          % change
sales and marketing            $700,464                  $498,439               41      %
sales and marketing expenses increased $202.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $106.4 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $29.2 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $23.2 million in overhead expenses, and an increase of $15.7 million in commission expense. commissions and referral fee expenses amounted to 7% and 8% of subscription revenues for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. outside services increased $3.7 million primarily due to an increase in contractors and professional fees to support our sales and marketing functions in addition, expenses related to our annual knowledge user conference increased $3.0 million, from $21.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 to $24.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, due to a 31% increase in attendance year-over-year. all other marketing program expenses, which include events, advertising and market data, increased $18.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.
the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended december 31, 2015 to the year ended december 31, 2016 had a favorable impact on our sales and marketing expenses. for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31, 2016 at the exchange rates for the year ended december 31, 2015 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our sales and marketing expenses would have increased by an additional $6.3 million.
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase for the year ended december 31, 2017 in absolute dollar terms, but decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to expand our direct sales force, increase our marketing activities, grow our international operations, build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events.
research and development year ended december 31          % change

research and development expenses increased $67.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $39.9 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $11.4 million in stock-based compensation, and an increase of $10.2 million in overhead expenses. outside services increased $2.0 million primarily due to increase in professional fees to support our research and development functions. research and development expenses also increased $2.5 million due to an increase in data center capacity costs and depreciation of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment that are used solely for research and development purposes. amortization of intangible assets increased $1.2 million as a result of acquisitions in 2016.
the impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended december 31, 2015 to the year ended december 31, 2016 is not material to research and development expenses.
we expect research and development expenses to increase for the year ended december 31, 2017 in absolute dollar terms, but decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services, develop new applications to fill market needs and continue to enhance our core platform.
general and administrative year ended december 31          % change
general and administrative expenses increased $32.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $13.3 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $11.1 million in stock-based compensation, and an increase of $6.1 million in overhead expenses.
the impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended december 31, 2015 to the year ended december 31, 2016 is not material to general and administrative expenses.
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase for the year ended december 31, 2017 in absolute dollar terms as we continue to hire people, but decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to grow.

stock-based compensation increased $59.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the prior year, primarily due to equity grants to new employees and additional grants to current employees.
stock-based compensation is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price. based upon our stock price as of december 31, 2016, we expect stock-based compensation to continue to increase for the year ended december 31, 2017 in absolute dollar terms, but decrease as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to grow.
interest expense year ended december 31                           % change
interest expense increased $2.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the prior year, due to the increase in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes (notes) issued in november 2013. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we expect to incur approximately $35.6 million in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to the notes.

interest income and other income (expense), net, increased $1.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased interest income, partially offset by increased foreign exchange losses. we had foreign exchange losses of $2.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to gains of $0.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. interest income increased $3.3 million due to the higher yields during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.
our expanding international operations will continue to increase our exposure to currency risks, though we cannot presently predict the impact of this exposure on our consolidated financial statements. while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date, we are conducting an ongoing evaluation of the costs and benefits of initiating such a program and in the future may hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar.

our effective tax rate was 0% for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to (3)% for the prior year. our tax expense decreased $3.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a partial release of valuation allowance in connection with acquisitions. see note 15 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes.
we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our u.s. federal and state deferred tax assets, and the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes in various jurisdictions. the cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction's individual tax rates, laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions, and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. given the full valuation allowance, sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring, we expect our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. we consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states.
net loss year ended december 31                            % change
net loss increased $253.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the prior year primarily due to legal settlements. refer to note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further details of these matters. we expect to continue to incur a gaap loss for the year ended december 31, 2017, due to increased costs and expenses including non-cash charges associated with equity awards, amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations and other expenses.

professional services and other revenues increased $41.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in the services provided to our growing customer base. in addition, revenues from our annual knowledge user conference increased to $10.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $8.2 million in the prior year due to increased sponsorship and paid registrations in the current year.
our international operations provided a significant portion of our total revenues. revenues outside north america represented 30% and 32% of total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. as a result, the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily euro) from the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2015 had an unfavorable impact on our revenues. for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31, 2015 at the exchange rates for the year ended december 31, 2014 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our subscription revenues would have increased by an additional $48.0 million and our professional services and other revenues would have increased by an additional $12.0 million.

cost of subscription revenues increased $40.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $11.2 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $8.4 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $6.0 million in depreciation expense primarily due to purchases of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment for our data centers and an increase of $6.0 million in other overhead expenses. data center capacity costs increased $1.0 million primarily due to the expansion of our data centers. amortization of intangible assets increased $4.8 million as a result of the acquisition of neebula in july 2014.
our subscription gross profit percentage increased to 78% for the year ended december 31, 2015, from 75% for the year ended december 31, 2014, due to improved data center utilization and economies of scale.
cost of professional services and other revenues increased $39.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $11.2 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $10.1 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $5.3 million in overhead expenses, and an increase of $13.2 million in contracted third-party costs.
our professional services and other gross profit percentage decreased to 7% during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 8% in the prior year due to increased stock-based compensation. the decrease in gross profit percentage was partially offset by the increase in revenues from our annual knowledge user conference. costs associated with knowledge are included in sales and marketing expense. knowledge contributed $10.9 million, or 7 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31, 2015. knowledge contributed $8.2 million, or 7 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31, 2014.
the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2015 had a favorable impact on our cost of revenues. for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31, 2015 at the exchange rates for the year ended december 31, 2014 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the year ended december 31, 2015, our cost of subscription revenues would have increased by an additional $8.0 million and our cost of professional services and other revenues would have increased by an additional $7.8 million.

in addition, expenses related to our annual knowledge user conference increased $5.7 million, from $15.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 to $21.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, due to a 31% increase in attendance year-over-year. all other marketing program expenses, which include events, advertising and market data, increased $10.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year.
the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2015 had a favorable impact on our sales and marketing expenses. for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31, 2015 at the exchange rates for the year ended december 31, 2014 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our sales and marketing expenses would have increased by an additional $20.9 million.

seasonality, cyclicality and quarterly trends we have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our services. we sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the quarter ended december 31. the increase in customer agreements for the quarter ended december 31 is primarily a result of the terms of our commission plans to incentivize our direct sales force to meet their annual quotas by december 31 and large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry which are driven primarily by the expiration of annual authorized budgeted expenditures. furthermore, we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of each quarter. this seasonality in the timing of entering into customer contracts is sometimes not immediately apparent, in our billings, due to the fact that we exclude contracts with a future start date from our billings. similarly, this seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenues, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues over the term of the license agreement, which is generally 12 to 36 months. although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance.
our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new customers, as well as upsells to existing customers. we have historically seen an increase in professional services and other revenues in the quarter ended june 30, and a corresponding decrease in professional services and other revenues in the quarter ended september 30 due to the revenues earned from our annual knowledge user conference that occurs in the quarter ended june 30. our operating expenses have increased over the periods presented primarily due to increases in headcount and other related expenses to support our growth. we have historically seen an increase in marketing expenses in the quarter ended june 30, and a corresponding decrease in marketing expenses in the quarter ended september 30 due to the expenses incurred for our annual knowledge user conference. marketing expenses in the quarter ended december 31 are also historically higher due to customer forums we conduct in that quarter. we anticipate operating expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the long-term growth of our business.
our free cash flow is impacted by the timing of collections and disbursements, including the timing of capital expenditures. we have historically seen higher collections in the quarter ended march 31 due to seasonality in timing of entering into customer contracts as described above.

our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations. as of december 31, 2016, we had $899.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which $184.5 million represented cash owned by foreign subsidiaries. in addition, we had $262.7 million in long-term investments that provide additional capital resources.
we anticipate our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including the expansion of data centers, lease obligations, expenditures related to the growth of our headcount and the acquisition of fixed assets, intangibles, and investments in office facilities to accommodate our growth for at least the next 12 months. whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth, operating results, cash utilized for acquisitions and/or debt retirements if any are consummated, and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our services. if we require additional capital resources to grow our business at any time in the future, we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek additional equity or debt financing.
operating activities cash provided by operating activities mainly consists of our net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, amortization of premiums on investments, amortization of deferred commissions, amortization of issuance cost and debt discount, stock-based compensation and changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year.
net cash provided by operating activities was $159.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $317.8 million for the prior year. the decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to $267.5 million cash paid for aggregate legal settlements during the year ended december 31, 2016 (refer to note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further details). the remaining change was due to an increase in non-cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities.
net cash provided by operating activities was $317.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $140.9 million for the prior year. the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to an increased net loss offset by a substantial increase in non-cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities. net cash flow from the aggregate of changes in accounts receivable, deferred commissions and deferred revenue increased due to increased sales for the year ended december 31, 2015. net cash flows from the aggregate of changes in accrued liabilities, accounts payable and prepaid expenses increased due to the growth of our business and increased headcount of 30% for the year ended december 31, 2015, as well as timing of our cash payments.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $108.4 million compared to $231.7 million for the prior year. the decrease in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to the $181.6 million decrease in the net purchases of investments and $10.0 million decrease in the purchases of strategic investments, partially offset by $33.2 million increase in business combinations, net of cash acquired, $17.0 million increase in purchase of other intangibles and $18.1 million increase in capital expenditures related to the purchase of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth.
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $231.7 million compared to $316.9 million for the prior year. the decrease in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to the $32.0 million decrease in the net purchases of investments and the $98.7 million decrease in cash used for acquisitions, offset by the $33.1 million increase in capital expenditures related to the purchase of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth and the $10.5 million increase in the purchases of strategic investments.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $55.8 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $80.3 million for the prior year. the change was primarily due to the $107.1 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards as a result of a policy change to net settle shares for all u.s. employees starting in 2016 and $27.0 million decrease in proceeds from employee stock plans due to a reduction in the number of stock options issued in the last four years. based upon our stock price as of december 31, 2016, we expect an increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards for the year ended december 31, 2017.
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $80.3 million compared to $68.7 million for the prior year. the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the $24.0 million increase in proceeds from employee stock plans, offset by the $12.1 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards.
contractual obligations and commitments the following table represents our future non-cancelable contractual obligations as of december 31, 2016, aggregated by type:
(1)   consists of future non-cancelable minimum rental payments under operating leases for some of our offices and data centers, net of future non-cancelable sublease income.
(2)   consists of future minimum payments under non-cancelable purchase commitments primarily related to data center and it operations. not included in the table above are certain purchase commitments related to our future knowledge user conferences. if we were to cancel these agreements as of december 31, 2016, we would have been obligated to pay cancellation penalties of approximately $18.1 million in aggregate.
(3)   refer to note 9 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
subsequent to the year ended december 31, 2016, we entered into certain lease agreements for additional office space. total future minimum lease payments under these operating leases of approximately $52.1 million in aggregate are not included in the table above. $29.6 million of the $52.1 million relates to an expansion and lease term extension of our existing san diego office facility.
in addition to the obligations in the table above, approximately $4.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of december 31, 2016. it is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled.
off-balance sheet arrangements during all periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. as such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships.
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. these items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material.
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we derive our revenues from two sources: (i) subscriptions and (ii) professional services and other. subscription revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and updates, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term.
our contracts typically do not give the customer the right to take possession of the software supporting the services. professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our services. professional services and other revenues also include customer training and attendance and sponsorship fees for knowledge, our annual user conference and other customer forums.
we commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met:
the service has been provided to the customer;
the collection of related fees is reasonably assured; and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.
we use a signed contract together with a signed order form as evidence of an arrangement for a new customer. in subsequent transactions with an existing customer, including an upsell or a renewal, we consider the existing signed contract and either the new signed order form or new purchase order as evidence of an arrangement.
we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, the date we make our services available to our customers. once our services are available to customers, we record amounts due in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue. to the extent we bill customers in advance of the contract commencement date, the accounts receivable and corresponding deferred revenue amounts are netted to zero on our consolidated balance sheets, unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date.
our professional services arrangements are primarily on a time-and-materials basis and revenues on these arrangements are recognized as the services are delivered. professional services revenues associated with fixed fee arrangements are recognized using a proportional performance model. in instances where certain milestones are required to be met before revenues are recognized, we defer professional services revenues and the associated costs until milestone criteria have been met.
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors such as past collection history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer. if we determine collectibility is not reasonably assured, we defer revenue recognition until collectibility becomes reasonably assured. we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. our arrangements are generally non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions.
we have multiple element arrangements comprised of subscription fees and professional services. we account for subscription and professional services revenues as separate units of accounting. to qualify as a separate unit of accounting, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis. we have concluded that our subscription service has standalone value as it is routinely sold separately by us. in addition, the applications offered through this subscription service are fully functional without any additional development, modification or customization. we provide customers access to our subscription service at the beginning of the contract term. in determining whether professional services have standalone value, we considered the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer's satisfaction with the professional services work. our professional services, including implementation and configuration services, are not so unique and complex that other vendors cannot provide them. in some instances, customers independently contract with third-party vendors to do the implementation and we regularly outsource implementation services to contracted third-party vendors. as a result, we concluded professional services, including implementation and configuration services, have standalone value.
the total arrangement consideration for a multiple element arrangement is allocated to the identifiable separate units of accounting based on a relative selling price hierarchy. we determined the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence (vsoe) of selling price or third-party evidence (tpe) of selling price if vsoe does not exist. if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable, the selling price is determined using the best estimate of selling price (besp). we determine the besp for each deliverable primarily by considering the historical selling price of these deliverables in similar transactions as well as other factors, including, but not limited to, market competition, review of stand-alone sales and current pricing practices. in determining the appropriate pricing structure, we consider the available information regarding the competitive pricing of similar products and marketing analysis.
in limited circumstances, we grant certain customers the right to deploy our subscription service on the customers' own servers. these arrangements are subject to software revenue recognition guidance since the customer deploys our software. as we never sell the non-software elements separately from the software elements, we have determined that we do not have sufficient vsoe of fair value for all undelivered non-software elements. consequently, we defer all revenue and related costs under the arrangement until the last element in the transaction has been delivered or starts to be delivered. once the delivery of the last element has commenced, we recognize the entire fee and related costs from the arrangement ratably over the remaining period of the arrangement.
deferred revenue consists primarily of payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our subscriptions and professional services and other revenues and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met.
deferred commissions deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are directly associated with our customer contracts and consist of sales commissions paid to our direct sales force and referral fees paid to independent third-parties. the majority of commissions and referral fees are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related customer contracts. we include amortization of deferred commissions in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the revenue is recognized. the commission payments are generally paid in full the month after the customer's initial service under the contract commences.
goodwill, intangible assets and other long lived assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets. these estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets included, but are not limited to, cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, discount rates, the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets and the profit margin a market participant would receive. these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.
we evaluate and test the recoverability of goodwill for impairment at least annually during our fourth quarter or more frequently if circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. we perform the impairment testing by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a two-step impairment test. the first step requires the identification of the reporting units and comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the second step of the impairment test is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. under the second step, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. we have determined that we have a single reporting unit. we have not recognized any impairment charges related to goodwill during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 because the aggregate fair value of our company has consistently and materially exceeded the carrying value of our single reporting unit.
we periodically review the carrying amounts of long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. we measure the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows we expect the asset to generate. if we consider any of these assets to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. in addition, we periodically evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization. our intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives ranging from 18 months to ten years.
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating fundamentals, competition and general economic conditions, requires significant judgment. additionally, changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly. therefore, there can be no assurance that a charge to operating expenses will not occur as a result of future goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets impairment tests.
legal contingencies from time to time, we are a party to litigation and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. we accrue for loss contingencies when we can reasonably estimate the amount of loss or range of loss and when, based on the advice of counsel, it is probable that we will incur the loss. because of uncertainties related to these matters, we base our estimate on the information available at the time of our assessment. as additional information becomes available, we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimate. any revisions in the estimate of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
stock-based compensation we recognize compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units (rsus) on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term of four years. for rsus granted with a performance condition, the expenses are recognized on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period, after assessing the probability of achieving requisite performance criteria. this has the impact of greater stock-based compensation expense during the initial years of the vesting period as stock-based compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were, in substance, multiple awards. we recognize compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan (espp) on a straight-line basis over the offering period. we estimate the fair value of options using the black-scholes options pricing model and fair value of rsu awards using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. we recognize compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture activity, which is based on historical forfeiture rates. we evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed. this may cause a fluctuation in our stock-based compensation in the period of change.
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed. we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date. a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. in determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, carryforward periods and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. we measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision. significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law or guidance, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.
we calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified. the amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by u.s. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. the estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management's assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. to the extent the assessment of such tax position changes, we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination.
in march 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-09, "compensation-stock compensation (topic 718): improvements to employee share-based payment accounting," which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. this standard is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning january 1, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. we elected to early adopt this standard during the three months ended june 30, 2016. the impact of the early adoption was as follows:
•   the standard eliminates additional paid in capital (apic) pools and requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement as a discrete item when the awards vest or are settled. the adoption of this guidance on a prospective basis resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes of $2.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.
•   the standard requires excess tax benefits be recognized regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable. the adoption of this guidance on a modified retrospective basis resulted in the recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment of $11.4 million that reduced our accumulated deficit and increased our foreign long-term deferred income tax as of january 1, 2016. the previously unrecognized domestic excess tax effects were recorded as a deferred tax asset net of a valuation allowance.
•   we have elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of stock-based compensation cost to be recognized in each period. as such, the guidance relating to forfeitures did not have an impact on our accumulated deficit as of january 1, 2016.
•   we elected to apply the statement of cash flows guidance that cash flows related to excess tax benefits be presented as an operating activity retrospectively, which resulted in a $2.7 million increase to net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding decrease to net cash provided by financing activities in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2015, and a $2.0 million increase to net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding decrease to net cash provided by financing activities in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to the amounts previously reported.
•   the statement of cash flows guidance that cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares be presented as a financing activity had no impact on our consolidated financial statements as we have historically presented such cash flows as a financing activity.
in september 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-16, "simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments (topic 805)," which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments in business combinations. this new standard requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. we adopted this standard during the three months ended march 31, 2016 on a prospective basis and the adoption had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in april 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-05, "intangibles-goodwill and other-internal-use software (subtopic 350-40): customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement." asu 2015-05 provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes software. if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. if a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. we adopted this standard during the three months ended march 31, 2016 on a prospective basis and the adoption had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
pending accounting pronouncements in january 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-04, "intangibles - goodwill and other (topic 350): simplifying the test for goodwill impairment," which eliminates step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. the standard requires an entity to perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. in addition, this new standard eliminates the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment. this standard is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted. we do not anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in january 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-01, "business combinations (topic 805): clarifying the definition of a business," which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. the definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill and consolidation. this standard is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.
in november 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-18, "statement of cash flows (topic 230): restricted cash (a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force," which requires that amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. this standard is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. we do not anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in october 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-16, "income taxes (topic 740): intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory," which includes a revision of the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory to reduce the complexity in accounting standards. this standard is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.
in august 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-15, "statement of cash flows (topic 230): classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments," which provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. among these issues, this standard requires, at the settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowings, the portion of the cash payment attributable to the accreted interest related to the debt discount to be classified as cash flows for operating activities, and the portion of the cash payments attributable to the principal to be classified as cash outflows for financing activities. this standard is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.
in june 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-13, "financial instruments-credit losses (topic 326): measurement of credit losses on financial instruments," which requires a financial asset measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. this standard is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2019. we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.
in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, "leases (topic 842)," which requires lessees to generally recognize on the balance sheet operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets, and to recognize on the income statement the expenses in a manner similar to current practice. this new standard is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning january 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. while we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, we anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets given that we had operating lease commitments of approximately $300 million as of december 31, 2016. however, we do not anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss since the expense recognition under this new standard will be similar to current practice.
in january 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-01, "financial instruments-overall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities," which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. this new standard is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning january 1, 2018. we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)." under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. in addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. the fasb has recently issued several amendments to the standard, including clarification on accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations. these new standards are effective for our interim and annual periods beginning january 1, 2018 and early adoption beginning january 1, 2017 is permitted. we are planning to adopt these new standards beginning january 1, 2018.
the guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (modified retrospective method). we currently anticipate adopting the standard using the full retrospective method to restate each prior reporting period presented.
we expect the new standard to impact the timing of revenue and expense recognition for our contracts related to on-premises offerings, in which we grant customers the right to deploy our subscription service on the customer's own servers. under this new standard, the requirement to have vendor specific objective evidence (vsoe) for undelivered elements is eliminated. as such, we may be required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of the software compared to the current practice of recognizing the entire sales price ratably over an estimated subscription period due to the lack of vsoe. currently, revenues from our on-premises offerings, under the ratable recognition model, represent less than 10% of our total revenues. costs associated with our on-premises offerings, including commissions paid on the software, will be expensed immediately under the new standard.
in addition, we expect the new standard to impact our deferred commissions asset and the related amortization expense as the types of incremental costs requiring capitalization as well as the expense amortization period could change from our current practice. we currently expect the deferred commissions asset to increase and the related amortization expense in each reporting period to decrease under the new standard due to an increase in the average term over which such commissions are amortized.
we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements and our preliminary assessments are subject to change.

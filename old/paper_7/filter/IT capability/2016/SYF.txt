introduction and business overview
we are one of the premier consumer financial services companies in the united states. we provide a range of credit products through programs we have established with a diverse group of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare service providers, which we refer to as our "partners." during 2016, we financed $125.5 billion of purchase volume, and at december 31, 2016, we had $76.3 billion of loan receivables and 71.9 million active accounts. for the year ended december 31, 2016, we had net earnings of $2.3 billion, representing a return on assets of 2.7%.
we offer our credit products primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, synchrony bank (the "bank"). through the bank, we offer, directly to retail and commercial customers, a range of deposit products insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation ("fdic"). we have significantly expanded our online direct banking operations in recent years and our deposit base serves as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for our credit activities. at december 31, 2016, we had $52.1 billion in deposits which represented 72% of our total funding sources.
our separation from ge in november 2015, synchrony financial became a stand-alone savings and loan holding company following the completion of ge's exchange offer, in which ge exchanged shares of ge common stock for all of the shares of our common stock it owned (the "separation").
our sales platforms
we conduct our operations through a single business segment. profitability and expenses, including funding costs, loan losses and operating expenses, are managed for the business as a whole. substantially all of our operations are within the united states. we offer our credit products through three sales platforms (retail card, payment solutions and carecredit). those platforms are organized by the types of products we offer and the partners we work with, and are measured on interest and fees on loans, loan receivables, new accounts and other sales metrics. see "item 1. business-our sales platforms."
retail card retail card is a leading provider of private label credit cards, and also provides dual cards, general purpose co-branded credit cards and small- and medium-sized business credit products. we offer one or more of these products primarily through 26 national and regional retailers with which we have ongoing program agreements. the average length of our relationship with these retail card partners is 19 years. retail card's revenue consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables. other income primarily consists of interchange fees earned when our dual card or general purpose co-branded credit cards are used outside our partners' sales channels and fees paid to us by customers who purchase our debt cancellation products, less loyalty program payments. substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is on standard terms.
payment solutions payment solutions is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases, offering primarily private label credit cards and installment loans. at december 31, 2016, payment solutions offered these products through participating partners consisting of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups and industry associations. substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is promotional financing. payment solutions' revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, including "merchant discounts," which are fees paid to us by our partners in almost all cases to compensate us for all or part of foregone interest income associated with promotional financing.
carecredit carecredit is a leading provider of promotional financing to consumers for health and personal care procedures, products or services. at december 31, 2016, we had a network of carecredit providers and health-focused retailers that collectively have approximately 200,000 locations, the vast majority of which are individual or small groups of independent healthcare providers, through which we offer a carecredit branded private label credit card. substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is promotional financing. carecredit's revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, including merchant discounts.
our credit products
through our platforms, we offer three principal types of credit products: credit cards, commercial credit products and consumer installment loans. see "item 1. business - our credit products."
credit cards we offer the following principal types of credit cards:
•   private label credit cards. private label credit cards are partner-branded credit cards (e.g., lowe's or amazon) or program-branded credit cards (e.g., synchrony car care or carecredit) that are used primarily for the purchase of goods and services from the partner or within the program network. in addition, in some cases, cardholders may be permitted to access their credit card accounts for cash advances. in retail card, credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended on standard terms only, and in payment solutions and carecredit, credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended pursuant to a promotional financing offer.
•   dual cards and general purpose co-brand cards. our patented dual cards are credit cards that function as private label credit cards when used to purchase goods and services from our partners and as general purpose credit cards when used elsewhere. we also offer general purpose co-branded credit cards that do not also function as private label cards. credit extended under our dual cards and general purpose co-branded credit cards typically is extended under standard terms only. currently, only our retail card platform offers dual cards and general purpose co-branded credit cards. at december 31, 2016, we offered these credit cards through 18 of our 26 ongoing retail card programs, of which the majority are dual cards.
commercial credit products we offer private label cards and dual cards for commercial customers that are similar to our consumer offerings. we also offer a commercial pay-in-full accounts receivable product to a wide range of business customers. we offer our commercial credit products primarily through our retail card platform to the commercial customers of our retail card partners.
installment loans in payment solutions, we originate installment loans to consumers (and a limited number of commercial customers) in the united states, primarily in the power products market (motorcycles, atvs and lawn and garden). installment loans are closed-end credit accounts where the customer pays down the outstanding balance in installments. installment loans are assessed periodic finance charges using fixed interest rates.
business trends and conditions
we believe our business and results of operations will be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions, including the following:
•   growth in loan receivables and interest income. we believe continuing improvement in the u.s. economy and employment rates will contribute to an increase in consumer credit spending. in addition, we expect the use of credit cards to continue to increase versus other forms of payment such as cash and checks. we anticipate that these trends, combined with our marketing and partner engagement strategies, will contribute to growth in our loan receivables. in the near-to-medium term, we expect our total interest income to continue to grow, driven by the expected growth in average loan receivables. our historical growth rates in loan receivables and interest income have benefited from new partner acquisitions, and therefore, if we do not continue to acquire new partners, replace the programs that are not extended or otherwise grow our business, our growth rates in loan receivables and interest income in the future will be lower than in recent periods. in addition, we do not expect to make any significant changes to customer pricing or merchant discount pricing in the near term other than those associated with changes in the prime rate and libor, and therefore we expect yields generated from interest and fees on interest-earning assets will remain relatively stable.
•   extended duration of our retail card program agreements. our retail card program agreements typically have contract terms ranging from approximately five to ten years, and the average length of our relationship with our ongoing retail card partners is 19 years. we expect to continue to benefit from these programs on a long-term basis as indicated by the expiration schedule included in "item 1. business-our sales platforms-retail card", which indicates for each period the number of programs scheduled to expire and the proportion of interest and fees on loans that these programs comprised for the year ended december 31, 2016.
a total of 23 of our 26 retail card program agreements now have an expiration date in 2019 or beyond. these 23 program agreements represented in the aggregate 99% of our retail card interest and fees on loans for the year ended december 31, 2016 and 99% of our retail card loan receivables at december 31, 2016.
•   stable asset quality. the credit environment remained favorable during 2016. our actual net charge-off rates have remained relatively stable, increasing by 21 basis points to 4.57% for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 4.36% for the year ended december 31, 2015, which represents a modest increase from the low credit trends we have experienced in the last two years. the assessment of our credit profile includes the evaluation of portfolio mix, account maturation, as well as broader consumer trends, such as payment behavior and overall indebtedness. during 2016, these factors contributed to increases in our delinquent accounts and our forecasted net charge-off rate over the next twelve months. accordingly, we also experienced a corresponding increase in our allowance coverage ratio, as we reserved for these forecasted losses inherent in our loan portfolio. in the near term, we expect u.s. unemployment rates to continue to stabilize and we do not anticipate making significant changes to our underwriting standards. in this credit environment, we expect the trend of modest increases in our net charge-off rates, delinquencies and allowance coverage to continue in 2017.
•   growth in interchange revenues and loyalty program costs. we believe that as a result of the overall growth in dual card and general purpose co-branded credit card transactions occurring outside of our retail card partners' locations, interchange revenues will continue to increase. the expected growth in these transactions is driven, in part, by both existing and new loyalty programs with our retail card partners. in addition, we continue to offer and add new loyalty programs for our private label credit cards, for which we do not receive interchange fees. the growth in these existing and new loyalty programs will result in an increase in costs associated with these programs. overall, we expect both our interchange revenues and loyalty program costs to grow in excess of the growth of our retail card loan receivables, and expect the increase in loyalty program costs to be higher than that expected for interchange revenues due to the additional loyalty programs for our private label credit cards where we do not charge interchange fees. these increases have been contemplated in our program agreements with our retail card partners and are a component of the calculation of our payments due under our retailer share arrangements.
•   capital and liquidity levels. we continue to expect to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity resources to support our daily operations, our business growth, and our credit ratings as well as regulatory and compliance requirements in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments. in july 2016, we established both dividend and share repurchase programs, and accordingly, during the year ended december 31, 2016, we declared and paid dividends of $214 million and repurchased $476 million of our outstanding common stock. while these programs have now been established, and we expect to continue to deploy capital through both dividends and share repurchases, subject to regulatory approval, we also continue to expect to maintain capital ratios well in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. at december 31, 2016, the company had a basel iii common equity tier 1 ratio under transitional guidelines of 17.2%. we also expect that our liquidity portfolio will continue to be sufficient to support all of our business objectives and to meet all regulatory requirements.
seasonality
in our retail card and payment solutions platforms, we experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from august through a peak in late december, with reductions in loan receivables occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down.
the seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations, delinquency metrics and the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods. these fluctuations are generally most evident between the fourth quarter and the first quarter of the following year.
in addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above, we also experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates resulting in higher net charge-off rates in the first and second quarters. our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status resulting in lower net charge-off rates in the third and fourth quarters. because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods, we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in charge-offs, as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end. consistent with this historical experience, we generally experience a higher allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period, as compared to the end of a calendar year. in addition, despite improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts, we may experience an increase in our allowance for loan losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end, reflecting these same seasonal trends.

(1)   average balances for the year ended december 31, 2016 are now presented in the table above, and throughout management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where applicable, based upon daily balances. average balances for the year ended december 31, 2015 have been revised to conform to the current year presentation.
(2)   average balances for the year ended december 31, 2014 are based on monthly balances, including beginning of period balances, except where monthly balances are unavailable and quarterly balances are used. collection of daily averages for this period involves undue burden and expense. we believe our average balance sheet data appropriately incorporates the seasonality in the level of our loan receivables and is representative of our operations.
(4)   includes average restricted cash balances of $436 million, $527 million and $331 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
(5)   interest income on loan receivables includes fees on loans of $2,458 million, $2,235 million and $2,129 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
(6)   the effective interest rates for the bank term loan for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 were 2.48% and 2.23%, respectively. the bank term loan effective rate excludes the impact of charges incurred in connection with prepayments of the loan.
(7)   interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on total interest-earning assets and the rate on total interest-bearing liabilities.
(8)   net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.
the following table sets forth the amount of changes in interest income and interest expense due to changes in average volume and average yield/rate. variances due to changes in both average volume and average yield/rate have been allocated between the average volume and average yield/rate variances on a consistent basis based upon the respective percentage changes in average volume and average yield/rate.

interest income interest income is comprised of interest and fees on loans, which includes merchant discounts provided by partners to compensate us in almost all cases for all or part of the promotional financing provided to their customers, and interest on cash and equivalents and investment securities. we include in interest and fees on loans any past due interest and fees deemed to be collectible. direct loan origination costs on credit card loans are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a one-year period and recorded in interest and fees on loans. for non-credit card receivables, direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan and recorded in interest and fees on loans.
we analyze interest income as a function of two principal components: average interest-earning assets and yield on average interest-earning assets. key drivers of average interest-earning assets include:
•   purchase volumes, which are influenced by a number of factors including macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence generally, our partners' sales and our ability to increase our share of those sales;
•   payment rates, reflecting the extent to which customers maintain a credit balance;
•   the size of our liquidity portfolio; and
•   portfolio acquisitions when we enter into new partner relationships.
key drivers of yield on average interest-earning assets include:
•   changes to our mix of loans (e.g., the number of loans bearing promotional rates as compared to standard rates);
•   credit performance and accrual status of our loans; and
•   yield earned on our liquidity portfolio.
interest income increased by $1,550 million, or 11.7%, for the year ended december 31, 2016, and by $986 million, or 8.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2015. these increases were driven primarily by growth in our average loan receivables.

the increase in average loan receivables of 11.3% for the year ended december 31, 2016 was driven primarily by higher purchase volume of 10.4%. average active accounts increased 6.8% to 66.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 and the average balances per these active accounts increased 4.2%.
the increase in average loan receivables for the year ended december 31, 2015, was driven primarily by higher purchase volume of 10.1% as a result of average active account growth and higher purchase volume per account. average active accounts increased 4.4% to 62.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 from 60.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014.
yield on average interest-earning assets the yield on interest-earning assets increased for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase in the percentage of interest-earning assets attributable to loan receivables. the yield on our average loan receivables remained relatively flat at 21.39% for the year ended december 31, 2016, as slightly lower payment rates were offset by growth in promotional balances.
the decrease in yield on interest-earning assets for the year ended december 31, 2015 was driven primarily by growth in our liquidity portfolio, which is comprised primarily of cash and equivalents and obligations of the u.s. treasury that mature in less than twelve months, which results in a significantly lower yield than our loan receivables. the yield on our average loan receivables decreased to 21.38% for the year ended december 31, 2015 from 21.39% for the year ended december 31, 2014, reflecting the impact of slightly higher payment rates from our customers and growth in promotional balances.
interest expense interest expense is incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities, which consisted of interest-bearing deposit accounts, borrowings of consolidated securitization entities, senior unsecured notes and the bank term loan.
•   the amounts outstanding of our deposits and borrowings;

interest expense increased by $113 million, or 10.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2016, driven primarily by the growth in our deposit liabilities. our cost of funds increased to 1.85% for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 1.83% for the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily due to higher short-term benchmark rates.
interest expense increased by $213 million, or 23.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2015, driven primarily by increases in average interest-bearing liabilities of $7,481 million, or 13.7% and an increase of 14 basis points in our cost of funds arising from the changes in our funding mix. our cost of funds increased to 1.83% for the year ended december 31, 2015 from 1.69% for the year ended december 31, 2014.

the increase in average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended december 31, 2016 was driven primarily by growth in our direct deposits partially offset by the repayment of third-party debt and lower securitized financings.
the increase in average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended december 31, 2015 was driven primarily by growth in our direct deposits and the issuance of third-party debt to replace our related party funding from gecc.
net interest income increased by $1,437 million, or 11.9%, for the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily driven by higher average loan receivables.
net interest income increased by $773 million, or 6.8%, for the year ended december 31, 2015, driven by higher average loan receivables, partially offset by increased interest expense driven by higher liquidity, funding mix and growth.
retailer share arrangements most of our retail card program agreements and certain other program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partners if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractually defined threshold. we also provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts, in some cases instead of retailer share arrangements (for example, on our co-branded credit cards). all of these arrangements are designed to align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products. although the retailer share arrangements vary by partner, these arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program, based typically on agreed upon program revenues (including interest income and certain other income) less agreed upon program expenses (including interest expense, provision for loan losses, retailer payments and operating expenses), and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold. the threshold and economic performance of a program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on, among other things, agreed upon measures of program expenses rather than our actual expenses, and therefore increases in our actual expenses (such as funding costs or operating expenses) may not necessarily result in reduced payments under our retailer share arrangements. these arrangements are typically designed to permit us to achieve an economic return before we are required to make payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold. our payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements have increased in recent years (both in absolute terms and as a proportion of interest income), partially as a result of the growth of our receivables related to programs with retailer share arrangements and improvements in the credit performance of these receivables. in addition, we have made changes to the terms of certain program agreements that have been renegotiated in the past few years that have contributed to the increase in payments to partners pursuant to retailer share arrangements.
we believe that our retailer share arrangements have been effective in helping us to grow our business by aligning our partners' interests with ours. we also believe that changes to the terms of certain program agreements that have contributed to the increase in our retailer share arrangement payments will help us to grow our business by providing an additional incentive to the relevant partners to promote our credit products going forward. payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements would generally decrease, and mitigate the impact on our profitability, in the event of declines in the performance of the programs or the occurrence of other unfavorable developments that impact the calculation of payments to our partners pursuant to our retailer share arrangements.
retailer share arrangements increased by $164 million, or 6.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2016, driven primarily by the growth and improved performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements, partially offset by higher provision for loan losses and loyalty costs associated with these programs.
retailer share arrangements increased by $163 million, or 6.3%, for the year ended december 31, 2015, driven primarily by the growth and improved performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements, partially offset with increased other expense and loyalty costs associated with these programs.
provision for loan losses provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at each period end date. provision for loan losses in each period is a function of net charge-offs (gross charge-offs net of recoveries) and the required level of the allowance for loan losses. our process to determine our allowance for loan losses is based upon our estimate of the incurred loss period for each type of loss (i.e., aged, fraud, deceased, settlement, other non-aged and bankruptcy). see "critical accounting estimates - allowance for loan losses" and note 2. basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information on our allowance for loan loss methodology.
provision for loan losses increased by $1,034 million, or 35.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to a higher loan loss reserve build and receivables growth. the reserve build resulted from increases in our future expected losses in the next twelve months which were primarily driven by the factors discussed in "business trends and conditions - stable asset quality" above.
our allowance coverage ratio increased to 5.69% at december 31, 2016, as compared to 5.12% at december 31, 2015, reflecting the increase in forecasted losses inherent in our loan portfolio.
provision for loan losses increased by $35 million, or 1.2%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily due to portfolio growth, partially offset by improving asset quality trends. our allowance coverage ratio decreased to 5.12% at december 31, 2015, as compared to 5.28% at december 31, 2014, reflecting improvements in our asset quality trends.

interchange revenue we earn interchange fees on dual card and other co-branded credit card transactions outside of our partners' sales channels, based on a flat fee plus a percent of the purchase amount. we also process general purpose card transactions for some payment solutions and carecredit partners as their acquiring bank, for which we obtain an interchange fee. growth in interchange revenue has been, and is expected to continue to be, driven primarily by growth in our dual card and general purpose co-branded credit card products.
interchange revenue increased by $97 million, or 19.2%, for the year ended december 31, 2016, and by $116 million, or 29.8%, for the year ended december 31, 2015, driven by increases in purchase volume outside of our retail partners' sales channels.
debt cancellation fees debt cancellation fees relate to payment protection products purchased by our credit card customers. customers who choose to purchase these products are charged a monthly fee based on their account balance. in return, we will cancel all or a portion of a customer's credit card balance in the event of certain qualifying life events. we offer our debt cancellation product to our credit card customers online and, on a limited basis, by direct mail. we no longer offer this product via phone calls to our customer service department.
debt cancellation fees increased by $13 million, or 5.2%, for the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily as a result of changes in marketing to our carecredit customers, driving an increase in enrollment and billed balances. debt cancellation fees decreased by $26 million, or 9.5%, for the year ended december 31, 2015, due to the fact that we now only offer the product through our on-line channel, resulting in fewer customers being enrolled in the product.
loyalty programs we operate a number of loyalty programs in our retail card platform that are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer, while reinforcing the value of the card and strengthening cardholder loyalty. these programs typically provide cardholders with rewards in the form of merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a pre-set spending level on their private label credit card, dual card or general purpose co-branded credit card. other programs provide cash back or rewards points, which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards. growth in loyalty program payments has been, and is expected to continue to be, driven by growth in purchase volume related to existing loyalty programs and the rollout of new loyalty programs.
loyalty programs cost increased by $128 million, or 30.5%, for the year ended december 31, 2016, and by $138 million, or 49.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2015, arising from the launch of new rewards programs with our partners and growth in purchase volume associated with existing loyalty programs.
other other includes a variety of items including ancillary fees and investment gains/losses.
other decreased by $30 million, or 52.6%, for the year ended december 31, 2016, and decreased by $45 million, or 44.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease in both years was primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $20 million associated with the sale of certain loan portfolios in 2015 and a larger gain recorded in connection with portfolio sales in 2014.

employee costs employee costs primarily consist of employee compensation and benefit costs.
employee costs increased by $165 million, or 15.8%, for the year ended december 31, 2016, and by $176 million, or 20.3%, for the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily due to new employees added to support the continued growth of the business and replacement of certain services provided by ge and third parties.
professional fees professional fees consist primarily of outsourced provider fees (e.g., collection agencies and call centers), legal, accounting, consulting, and recruiting expenses.
professional fees decreased by $7 million, or 1.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to a reduction in costs associated with the separation, partially offset by business growth.
professional fees increased by $82 million, or 14.6%, for the year ended december 31, 2015. these expense increases were due to business growth, the separation and higher third-party costs related to the emv card rollout for active dual card accounts.
marketing and business development marketing and business development costs consist primarily of our contractual and discretionary marketing and business development spend, as well as amortization expense associated with retail partner contract acquisitions and extensions.
marketing and business development costs decreased by $10 million, or 2.3%, for the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily by redirecting marketing funds into our partners' loyalty programs and reduced marketing on retail deposits.
marketing and business development costs decreased by $27 million, or 5.9%, for the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily due to lower portfolio marketing investments and lower brand advertising.
information processing information processing costs primarily consist of fees related to outsourced information processing providers, credit card associations and software licensing agreements.
information processing costs increased by $41 million, or 13.8%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 and by $85 million, or 40.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily due to higher information technology investment and higher transaction volume.
other other primarily consists of postage, fraud expense, litigation and regulatory matters expense and various other corporate overhead items such as facilities leases and maintenance, leased equipment and telephone charges. postage is driven primarily by the number of our active accounts and the percentage of customers that utilize our electronic billing option. fraud is driven primarily by the number of our active dual card and general purpose co-branded credit card accounts.
the "other" component decreased for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily driven by lower payments to ge due to the replacement of certain services that were previously provided to us under the transition services agreement, as well as benefits from the rollout of emv cards.
the "other" component increased for the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily due to investments in growth, infrastructure build in preparation for separation from ge, higher fraud expense, and also included expenses related to the completion of the emv card rollout for active dual card accounts. these increases were largely offset by the impact of corporate overhead allocations no longer being billed to us by ge following our ipo.
provision for income taxes years ended december 31 ($ in millions)            2016                2015                2014

we now file consolidated u.s. federal and state income tax returns separate and apart from ge. for periods up to and including the date of separation, we were included in the consolidated u.s. federal and state income tax returns of ge, where applicable, but also filed certain separate state and foreign income tax returns. the tax provision is presented on a separate company basis as if we were a separate filer for tax purposes for all periods presented. the effects of tax adjustments and settlements from taxing authorities are presented in our consolidated and combined financial statements in the period in which they occur. our current obligations for taxes are settled with the relevant tax authority, or ge, as applicable, on an estimated basis and adjusted in later periods as appropriate and are reflected in our consolidated and combined financial statements in the periods in which those settlements occur. we recognize the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws. see "critical accounting estimates-income taxes" for a discussion of the significant judgments and estimates related to income taxes.
the effective tax rates for each of the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 decreased slightly compared to the corresponding prior year period. the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to the discrete impact of a change in the effective state tax rate, research and development credits and an additional tax benefit that is reimbursed to ge under the terms of the tssa. the decrease in 2015 was primarily due to a reduction in certain non-deductible expenses and tax reserves for uncertain income tax positions, partially offset by increases in current state tax rates, and a non-recurring tax expense incurred in the prior year related to an internal corporate reorganization. in each year, the effective tax rate differs from the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0%, primarily due to state income taxes.
platform analysis as discussed above under "-our sales platforms," we offer our products through three sales platforms (retail card, payment solutions and carecredit), which management measures based on their revenue-generating activities. the following is a discussion of certain supplemental information for the year ended december 31, 2016, for each of our sales platforms.

(1)   credit card loans have minimum payment requirements but no stated maturity and therefore are included in the due within one year category. however, many of our credit card holders will revolve their balances, which may extend their repayment period beyond one year for balances at december 31, 2016.
(2)   credit card and commercial loans due after one year relate to troubled debt restructuring ("tdr") assets our loan receivables portfolio had the following geographic concentration at december 31, 2016.
california                       $7,523                                   9.9                    %
impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings our loss mitigation strategy is intended to minimize economic loss and at times can result in rate reductions, principal forgiveness, extensions or other actions, which may cause the related loan to be classified as a troubled debt restructuring ("tdr") and also be impaired. we primarily use long-term (12 to 60 months) modification programs for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as a loss mitigation strategy to improve long-term collectability of the loans that are classified as tdrs. the long-term program involves changing the structure of the loan to a fixed payment loan with a maturity no longer than 60 months and reducing the interest rate on the loan. the long-term program does not normally provide for the forgiveness of unpaid principal, but may allow for the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments. we also make loan modifications for some customers who request financial assistance through external sources, such as a consumer credit counseling agency program. the loans that are modified typically receive a reduced interest rate but continue to be subject to the original minimum payment terms and do not normally include waiver of unpaid principal, interest or fees. the determination of whether these changes to the terms and conditions meet the tdr criteria includes our consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.
loans classified as tdrs are recorded at their present value with impairment measured as the difference between the loan balance and the discounted present value of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the original effective interest rate of the loan. our allowance for loan losses on tdrs is generally measured based on the difference between the recorded loan receivable and the present value of the expected future cash flows.
interest income from loans accounted for as tdrs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. we accrue interest on credit card balances until the accounts are charged-off in the period the accounts become 180 days past due. the following table presents the amount of loan receivables that are not accruing interest, loans that are 90 days or more past-due and still accruing interest, and earning tdrs for the periods presented.
(1)   at december 31, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, balances exclude $66 million, $51 million, $54 million and $70 million, respectively, of tdrs which are included in loans contractually 90 days past-due and still accruing interest balance. see note 4. loan receivables and allowance for loan losses to our consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information on the financial effects of tdrs for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
gross amount of interest income that would have been recorded in accordance with the original contractual terms      $179              $153
total interest income foregone                                                                                       $131              $104
delinquencies over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables increased to 4.32% at december 31, 2016, as compared to 4.06% at december 31, 2015 and 4.14% at december 31, 2014. the 26 basis point increase in 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year was driven by the factors discussed in "business trends and conditions - stable asset quality" above. the 8 basis point decrease in 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year was driven by general improvement in the u.s. economy.
net charge-offs net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. we exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and third-party fraud losses from charge-offs. charged-off and recovered finance charges and fees are included in interest and fees on loans while third-party fraud losses are included in other expense. charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses. costs incurred to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expense and included in other expense in our consolidated and combined statements of earnings.
the table below sets forth the ratio of net charge-offs to average loan receivables, including held for sale, for the periods indicated.

allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses totaled $4,344 million at december 31, 2016 compared with $3,497 million at december 31, 2015, representing our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio. our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables increased to 5.69% at december 31, 2016, from 5.12% at december 31, 2015, which reflects the increase in forecasted net charge-offs over the next twelve months as well as lower pricing of recoveries.

(1)   net charge-offs (gross charge-offs less recoveries) in certain portfolios may exceed the beginning allowance for loan losses as our revolving credit portfolios turn over more than once per year or, in all portfolios, can reflect losses that are incurred subsequent to the beginning of the period due to information becoming available during the period, which may identify further deterioration of existing loan receivables.
funding, liquidity and capital resources
we maintain a strong focus on liquidity and capital. our funding, liquidity and capital policies are designed to ensure that our business has the liquidity and capital resources to support our daily operations, our business growth, our credit ratings and our regulatory and policy requirements, in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments.
funding sources our primary funding sources include cash from operations, deposits (direct and brokered deposits), securitized financings and third-party debt.
the following table summarizes information concerning our funding sources during the periods indicated:

(1)   excludes $205 million, $202 million and $240 million average balance of non-interest-bearing deposits for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. non-interest-bearing deposits comprise less than 10% of total deposits for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
deposits we obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers ("direct deposits") or through third-party brokerage firms that offer our deposits to their customers ("brokered deposits"). at december 31, 2016, we had $37.9 billion in direct deposits (which includes deposits from banks and financial institutions) and $14.2 billion in deposits originated through brokerage firms (including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger that channels brokerage account deposits to us). a key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to continue to expand our direct deposits base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding.
our direct deposits include a range of fdic-insured deposit products, including certificates of deposit, iras, money market accounts and savings accounts.
brokered deposits are primarily from retail customers of large brokerage firms. we have relationships with 10 brokers that offer our deposits through their networks. our brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit that bear interest at a fixed rate and at december 31, 2016, had a weighted average remaining life of 2.8 years. these deposits generally are not subject to early withdrawal.
our ability to attract deposits is sensitive to, among other things, the interest rates we pay, and therefore, we bear funding risk if we fail to pay higher rates, or interest rate risk if we are required to pay higher rates, to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. to mitigate these risks, our funding strategy includes a range of deposit products, and we seek to maintain access to multiple other funding sources, including securitized financings (including our undrawn committed capacity) and unsecured debt.

securitized financings we have been engaged in the securitization of our credit card receivables since 1997. we access the asset-backed securitization market using the synchrony credit card master note trust ("synct") through which we issue asset-backed securities through both public transactions and private transactions funded by financial institutions and commercial paper conduits. in addition, we issue asset-backed securities in private transactions through the synchrony sales finance master trust ("sft"). during the second quarter of 2016 we repaid all of the remaining outstanding third party indebtedness issued by the synchrony receivables trust ("srt"), and during the fourth quarter of 2016 we terminated srt.
at december 31, 2016, we had $3.2 billion of outstanding private asset-backed securities and $9.2 billion of outstanding public asset-backed securities, in each case held by unrelated third parties.
the following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors' interests in securitized financings, excluding debt premiums, discounts and issuance costs at december 31, 2016.

we retain exposure to the performance of trust assets through: (i) in the case of synct and sft, subordinated retained interests in the receivables transferred to the trust in excess of the principal amount of the notes for a given series to provide credit enhancement for a particular series, as well as a pari passu seller's interest in each trust and (ii) subordinated classes of synct notes that we own.
all of our securitized financings include early repayment triggers, referred to as early amortization events, including events related to material breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, inability or failure of the bank to transfer loans to the trusts as required under the securitization documents, failure to make required payments or deposits pursuant to the securitization documents, and certain insolvency-related events with respect to the related securitization depositor, synchrony (solely with respect to synct) or the bank. in addition, an early amortization event will occur with respect to a series if the excess spread as it relates to a particular series falls below zero. following an early amortization event, principal collections on the loans in our trusts are applied to repay principal of the asset-backed securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund the origination activities of our business. the occurrence of an early amortization event also would limit or terminate our ability to issue future series out of the trust in which the early amortization event occurred. no early amortization event has occurred with respect to any of the securitized financings in synct or sft.
the following table summarizes for each of our trusts the three-month rolling average excess spread at december 31, 2016.
(1)   represents the excess spread (generally calculated as interest income collected from the applicable pool of loan receivables less applicable net charge-offs, interest expense and servicing costs, divided by the aggregate principal amount of loan receivables in the applicable pool) for each trust (or, in the case of synct, represents a range of the excess spreads relating to the particular series issued within the trust), in each case calculated in accordance with the applicable trust or series documentation, for the three securitization monthly periods ending prior to december 31, 2016.

(1)   the amounts shown exclude unamortized debt discounts, premiums and issuance costs.
bank term loan during the year ended december 31, 2016, we prepaid $4.1 billion representing all the remaining outstanding indebtedness under the bank term loan, which had an initial maturity date of august 2019.
short-term borrowings except as described above, there were no material short-term borrowings for the periods presented.
undrawn credit facilities at december 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of $6.2 billion of undrawn committed capacity on our securitized financings, subject to customary borrowing conditions, from private lenders under our two existing securitization programs.
in july 2016, we entered into a three-year unsecured revolving credit facility with private lenders, which provides $0.5 billion of committed capacity. at december 31, 2016, all of the committed capacity under this facility was undrawn, subject to customary borrowing conditions.
other at december 31, 2016, we had more than $25.0 billion of unencumbered assets in the bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the federal reserve board for credit at the discount window.
covenants the indenture pursuant to which our senior unsecured notes have been issued includes various covenants, including covenants that restrict (subject to certain exceptions) synchrony's ability to dispose of, or incur liens on, any of the voting stock of the bank or otherwise permit the bank to be merged, consolidated, leased or sold in a manner that results in the bank being less than 80% controlled by us.
if we do not satisfy any of these covenants discussed above, the maturity of amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become payable. we were in compliance with all of these covenants at december 31, 2016.
our real estate leases also include various covenants, but typically do not include financial covenants. if we do not satisfy the covenants in the real estate leases, the leases may be terminated and we may be liable for damage claims. at december 31, 2016, we were not in default under any of our credit facilities and had not received any notices of default under any of our real estate leases.
credit ratings our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings of the company, the bank and the ratings of our asset-backed securities.
our senior unsecured debt is rated bbb- (stable outlook) by fitch and bbb- (stable outlook) by s&p. in addition, certain of the asset-backed securities issued by synct are rated by fitch, s&p and/or moody's. a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. downgrades in these credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets.
liquidity
we seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth, satisfy debt obligations and to meet regulatory expectations under normal and stress conditions.
we maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business, which is the responsibility of our asset and liability management committee, a subcommittee of our risk committee. we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. we perform regular liquidity stress testing and contingency planning as part of our liquidity management process. we evaluate a range of stress scenarios including company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs.
we maintain a liquidity portfolio, which at december 31, 2016 had $13.6 billion of liquid assets, primarily consisting of cash and equivalents and short-term obligations of the u.s. treasury, less cash in transit which is not considered to be liquid, compared to a $14.8 billion of liquid assets at december 31, 2015. the decrease in liquid assets was primarily due to the prepayment of the bank term loan, partially offset by the increase in deposits.
as additional sources of liquidity, at december 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of $6.7 billion of undrawn credit facilities, subject to customary borrowing conditions, from private lenders under our existing securitization programs and an unsecured revolving credit facility, and we had more than $25.0 billion of unencumbered assets in the bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the federal reserve board for credit at the discount window.
as a general matter, investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid, giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash. the level and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions.
we rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the bank for liquidity; however, bank regulations, contractual restrictions and other factors limit the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the bank may pay to us. for a discussion of regulatory restrictions on the bank's ability to pay dividends, see "item 1a. risk factors-risks relating to regulation-we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; the bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness." and "regulation-savings association regulation-dividends and stock repurchases."

our primary sources of capital have been earnings generated by our business and existing equity capital. we seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the risks of our business, meet regulatory requirements, adhere to rating agency targets and support future business growth. the level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments. within these constraints, we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that will provide attractive returns to our stockholders.
our capital adequacy assessment also includes tax and accounting considerations in accordance with regulatory guidance. we maintain a net deferred tax asset on our balance sheet, and we include this asset when calculating our regulatory capital levels. however, for regulatory capital purposes, deferred tax assets (i) are limited to the amount of taxes previously paid that a company could recover through loss carrybacks; and (ii) 10% of the amount of our tier 1 capital. at december 31, 2016, no portion of our deferred tax asset was disallowed for regulatory capital purposes.
the bank is required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis, and as of january 1, 2017, synchrony is also required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis. under the occ's and the federal reserve board's stress test regulations, the bank and synchrony are required to use stress-testing methodologies providing for results under various scenarios of economic and financial market stress. in addition, while as a savings and loan holding company we currently are not subject to the federal reserve board's capital planning rule, we prepared and submitted a capital plan to the federal reserve board in april 2016 and commenced such plan in the third quarter of 2016.
dividend and share repurchases during the year ended december 31, 2016 we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.26 per share of common stock, or $214 million. the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of the board and will depend on many factors, including the financial condition, earnings, capital and liquidity requirements of us and the bank, regulatory restrictions, corporate law and contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. in addition, banking laws and regulations and our banking regulators may limit our ability to pay dividends and make repurchases of our stock. for a discussion of regulatory restrictions on our and the bank's ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock, see "risk factors-risks relating to regulation-synchrony is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends and repurchase its common stock; the bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to synchrony, which could limit synchrony's ability to pay dividends, repurchase its common stock or make payments on its indebtedness".
on july 7, 2016, the company also approved a share repurchase program of up to $952 million for the four quarters ending june 30, 2017. the company repurchased approximately 16.7 million shares of our common stock for $476 million, at an average price of $28.55. we made and expect to continue to make share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors, including legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals.
regulatory capital requirements - synchrony financial as a savings and loan holding company, we are required to maintain minimum capital ratios, under the applicable u.s. basel iii capital rules. for more information, see "regulation-savings and loan holding company regulation."
for synchrony financial to be a well-capitalized savings and loan holding company, synchrony bank must be well-capitalized and synchrony financial must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the federal reserve board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, synchrony financial met all the requirements to be deemed well-capitalized.
the following table sets forth at december 31, 2016 and 2015, the composition of our capital ratios for the company calculated under the basel iii regulatory capital standards, respectively.

(1)   tier 1 leverage ratio represents total tier 1 capital as a percentage of total average assets, after certain adjustments. all other ratios presented above represent the applicable capital measure as a percentage of risk-weighted assets.
the increase in our common equity tier 1 capital ratio was primarily due to the retention of a majority of our net earnings for the year ended december 31, 2016, partially offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets, as well as dividends and repurchases of our outstanding common stock that were made in 2016. the increase in risk-weighted assets was primarily due to growth in loan receivables.
non-gaap measures the capital ratios presented above include common equity tier 1 capital ("cet1") as calculated under the u.s. basel iii capital rules on a fully phased-in basis, which is not currently required by our regulators to be disclosed and, as such, is considered to be a non-gaap measure. we believe that this capital ratio is a useful measure to investors because it is widely used by analysts and regulators to assess the capital position of financial services companies, although this ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. the following table sets forth a reconciliation of the components of our cet1 capital ratio as calculated on a fully phased-in basis set forth above, to the comparable gaap components at december 31, 2016 and 2015.

failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. see "risk factors-risks relating to regulation-failure by synchrony and the bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us."
off-balance sheet arrangements and unfunded lending commitments
we do not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees of third-party obligations. guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make a guaranteed payment or perform an obligation to a third-party based on certain trigger events. at december 31, 2016, we had not recorded any contingent liabilities in our consolidated statements of financial position related to any guarantees.
we extend credit, primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on our credit cards, in the ordinary course of business. see note 4 - loan receivables and allowance for loan losses to our consolidated and combined financial statements for more information on our unfunded lending commitments.
in the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that require future cash payments. our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations at december 31, 2016 are summarized below.

(1)   savings accounts (including money market accounts), brokered network deposits sweeps, and non-interest-bearing deposits are assumed for purposes of this table to be due in 2017 because they may be withdrawn at any time without payment of any penalty.
(2)   deposits do not include interest payments because the amount and timing of these payments cannot be reasonably estimated as certain deposits have early withdrawal rights and also the option to roll interest payments into the balance. the average interest rate on our interest-bearing deposits for the year ended december 31, 2016 was 1.5%. see note 7. deposits to our consolidated and combined financial statements.
(3)   these amounts shown exclude interest on floating rate securitized borrowings. the weighted average interest rate at december 31, 2016 was 1.79%. see note 8. borrowings to our consolidated and combined financial statements.
(4)   the amounts shown exclude interest for the floating rate senior unsecured debt as payments of interest on these senior unsecured notes are based on floating rates.
(5)   purchase obligations at december 31, 2016 reflect the minimum purchase obligation under legally binding contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. these amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on our consolidated statement of financial position.
(6)   the table above does not include estimated payments of liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions. the inherent complexity and uncertainty around the timing and amount of future outflows for uncertain tax positions do not permit a reasonably reliable estimate of payments, if any, to be made in connection with these liabilities. at december 31, 2016, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $150 million, excluding related interest and penalties. see note 14. income taxes to the consolidated and combined financial statements.
(7)   the table above excludes our reimbursement obligations to ge for certain retiree benefits obligations of $175 million at december 31, 2016. see note 11. employee benefit plans to the consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information.
critical accounting estimates
in preparing our consolidated and combined financial statements, we have identified certain accounting estimates and assumptions that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. the critical accounting estimates we have identified relate to allowance for loan losses, asset impairment, income taxes and fair value measurements. all of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. if these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that these judgments and estimates could change, which may result in incremental losses on loan receivables, future impairments of investment securities, goodwill and intangible assets, and the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increases in our tax liabilities, among other effects. see note 2. basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated and combined financial statements, which discusses the significant accounting policies related to these estimates.
allowance for loan losses losses on loan receivables are recognized when they are incurred, which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio. the method for calculating the best estimate of probable losses takes into account our historical experience, adjusted for current conditions with each product and customer type, and our judgment concerning the probable effects of relevant observable data, trends and market factors.
we evaluate each portfolio quarterly. for credit card receivables, our estimation process includes analysis of historical data, and there is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced by the models to determine the allowance. our risk process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations, and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or on a portfolio basis, as appropriate. more specifically, we use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency. the migration analysis considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in the loan receivables. we use other analyses to estimate losses incurred on non-delinquent accounts. the considerations in these analyses include past performance, risk management techniques applied to various accounts, historical behavior of different account vintages, current economic conditions, recent trends in delinquencies, bankruptcy filings, account collection management, policy changes, account seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates, forecasting uncertainties and a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for losses, which compares this allowance for losses to projected net charge-offs over the next 12 months, in a manner consistent with regulatory guidance. we do not evaluate credit card loans for impairment on an individual basis, but instead estimate its allowance for credit card loan losses on a portfolio basis. further, experience is not available for new portfolios; therefore, while we are developing that experience, we set loss allowances based on our experience with the most closely analogous products in our portfolio. the underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated periodically to reflect our view of current conditions and are subject to the regulatory examination process, which can result in changes to our assumptions. changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for losses. it is possible that we will experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates.
asset impairment investments we regularly review investment securities for impairment, using both quantitative and qualitative criteria. for debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the security, and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists, such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, including whether the issuer is in compliance with the terms and covenants of the security. quantitative criteria include determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows. for equity securities, our criteria include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position.
goodwill and intangible assets we do not amortize goodwill but test it at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. a reporting unit is defined under gaap as the operating segment, or one level below that operating segment (the component level) if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. our operating segment consists of a single reporting unit, based on the level at which management regularly reviews and measures the business operating results.
goodwill impairment risk is first assessed under fasb accounting standards update ("asu") 2011-08, intangibles-goodwill and other (topic 350): testing goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors for our reporting unit. if potential goodwill impairment risk exists that indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we apply a two-step quantitative test. the first step compares the reporting unit's estimated fair value with its carrying value. if the carrying value of our reporting unit's net assets exceeds its fair value, the second step is applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill. if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the goodwill is considered impaired and reduced to its implied fair value. the qualitative assessment for each period presented in the consolidated and combined financial statements was performed without hindsight, assuming only factors and market conditions existing as of those dates, and resulted in no potential goodwill impairment risk for our reporting unit. consequently, goodwill was not deemed to be impaired for any of the periods presented.
definite-lived intangible assets principally consist of customer-related assets, including contract acquisitions and purchased credit card relationships. these assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. the evaluation compares the cash inflows expected to be generated from each intangible asset to its carrying value. if cash flows attributable to the intangible asset are less than the carrying value, the asset is considered impaired and written down to its estimated fair value. no impairments of definite-lived intangible assets have been recognized in the periods presented.
income taxes we are subject to income tax in the united states (federal, state and local) as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate. our provision for income tax expense is based on our income, the statutory tax rates and other provisions of the tax laws applicable to us in each of these various jurisdictions. these laws are complex and their application to our facts is at times open to interpretation. the process of determining our consolidated income tax expense includes significant judgments and estimates, including judgments regarding the interpretation of those laws. our provision for income taxes and our deferred tax assets and liabilities incorporate those judgments and estimates and reflect management's best estimate of current and future income taxes to be paid. we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.
deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities, as well as the impact of tax loss carryforwards or carrybacks, and are measured using the enacted income tax laws and rates that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. deferred tax assets are specific to the jurisdiction in which they arise and are recognized subject to management's judgment that realization of those assets is more likely than not. in making decisions regarding our ability to realize tax assets, we evaluate all positive and negative evidence, including projected future taxable income, taxable income in carryback periods, expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the implementation of available tax planning strategies. these decisions rely heavily on estimates. we use our historical experience and our short and long-range business forecasts to provide insight.
asc 740, income taxes, establishes the framework by which we determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to be maintained for uncertain income tax positions. applying this framework, we recognize the financial statement impact of uncertain income tax positions when we conclude that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of a position, that the position will be sustained upon examination. in certain situations, we establish a liability that represents the difference between a tax position taken (or expected to be taken) on an income tax return and the amount of taxes recognized in our financial statements.
fair value measurements assets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period include investments in debt and equity securities. assets that are not measured at fair value every reporting period, but that are subject to fair value measurements in certain circumstances primarily include loans that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale, impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, cost method and equity method investments that are written down to fair value when they are impaired.
assets that are written down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs. a fair value measurement is determined as the price that we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions, weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued.
in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. the asu will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in u.s. gaap when it becomes effective. in july 2015, the fasb approved a one-year deferral of this standard, with a revised effective date for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017. the scope of asu 2014-09 excludes interest and fee income on loans and as a result, the majority of the company's revenue will not be affected by the asu. we are still evaluating the impact that asu 2014-09 will have on our consolidated and combined financial statements and related disclosures. the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective (cumulative effect) transition method. we have not yet selected a transition method.
in june 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-13, financial instruments-credit losses: measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. this asu replaces the existing incurred loss impairment guidance with a new impairment model known as the current expected credit loss ("cecl") model, which is based on expected credit losses. the cecl model requires, upon origination of a loan, the recognition of all expected credit losses over the life of the loan based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. this standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018. the amendments in this standard will be recognized through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. while we are evaluating the effect that asu 2016-13 will have on our consolidated and combined financial statements and related disclosures, this standard is expected to result in an increase to the company's allowance for loan losses given the change to expected losses for the estimated life of the financial asset. the extent of the increase will depend on the asset quality of the portfolio, and economic conditions and forecasts at adoption.

this management's discussion and analysis, or md&a, should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
overview we manage our operations through three reportable segments: commercial and specialty business, government business and other. we regularly evaluate the appropriateness of our reportable segments, particularly in light of organizational changes, merger and acquisition activity and changing laws and regulations. as a result, these reportable segments may change in the future.
our commercial and specialty business segment includes our local group, national accounts, individual and specialty businesses. business units in the commercial and specialty business segment offer fully-insured health products; provide a broad array of managed care services to self-funded customers including claims processing, underwriting, stop loss insurance, actuarial services, provider network access, medical cost management, disease management, wellness programs and other administrative services; and provide an array of specialty and other insurance products and services such as dental, vision, life and disability insurance benefits, radiology benefit management and analytics-driven personal health care guidance.
our government business segment includes medicare and medicaid businesses, national government services, or ngs, and services provided to the federal government in connection with the federal employee program, or fep. medicare business includes services such as medicare advantage, medicare part d, and medicare supplement. medicaid business includes our managed care alternatives through publicly funded health care programs, including medicaid; temporary assistance for needy family, or tanf, programs; programs for seniors and people with disabilities, or spd; programs for long-term services and support, or ltss; children's health insurance programs, or chip, and medicaid expansion programs. ngs acts as a medicare contractor for the federal government in several regions across the nation.
our other segment includes other businesses that do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for an operating segment as defined by financial accounting standards board, or fasb, guidance, as well as corporate expenses not allocated to the other reportable segments.
our operating revenue consists of premiums, administrative fees and other revenue. premium revenue comes from fully-insured contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life benefits. administrative fees come from contracts where our customers are self-insured, or where the fee is based on either processing of transactions or a percent of network discount savings realized. additionally, we earn administrative fee revenues from our medicare processing business and from other health-related businesses including disease management programs. other revenue includes miscellaneous income other than premium revenue and administrative fees.
our benefit expense primarily includes costs of care for health services consumed by our fully-insured members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. all four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical procedures per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. a portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. any changes in these estimates are recorded in the period the need for such an adjustment arises. while we offer a diversified mix of managed care products and services through our managed care plans, our aggregate cost of care can fluctuate based on a change in the overall mix of these products and services. our managed care plans include: preferred provider organizations, or ppos; health maintenance organizations, or hmos; point-of-service plans, or pos plans;
traditional indemnity plans and other hybrid plans, including consumer-driven health plans, or cdhps; and hospital only and limited benefit products.
we classify certain claims-related costs as benefit expense to reflect costs incurred for our members' traditional medical care, as well as those expenses which improve our members' health and medical outcomes. these claims-related costs may be comprised of expenses incurred for: (i) medical management, including case and utilization management; (ii) health and wellness, including disease management services for such conditions as diabetes, high-risk pregnancies, congestive heart failure and asthma management and wellness initiatives like weight-loss programs and smoking cessation treatments; and (iii) clinical health policy. these types of claims-related costs are designed to ultimately lower our members' cost of care.
our selling expense consists of external broker commission expenses, and generally varies with premium or membership volume. our general and administrative expense consists of fixed and variable costs. examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium but are more aligned with changes in membership. the acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels and thus, associated compensation expense. other variable costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity.
our results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage health care costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members and our medical management and health and wellness programs. several economic factors related to health care costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage as well as direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies, have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. the potential effect of escalating health care costs, any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers and any regulatory or market driven restrictions on our ability to obtain adequate premium rates to offset overall inflation in health care costs, including increases in unit costs and utilization resulting from the aging of the population and other demographics, as well as advances in medical technology, may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business, and may have a material impact on our results of operations.
in march 2016, we filed a lawsuit against our vendor for pharmacy benefit management services, express scripts, inc., or express scripts, seeking to recover damages for pharmacy pricing that is higher than competitive benchmark pricing and damages related to operational breaches, and seeking various declarations under the agreement between the parties. in april 2016, express scripts filed an answer to the lawsuit disputing our contractual claims and alleging various defenses and counterclaims. for additional information regarding this lawsuit, see note 13, "commitments and contingencies - litigation," to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
on july 24, 2015, we and cigna corporation, or cigna, announced that we entered into an agreement and plan of merger, or merger agreement, dated as of july 23, 2015, by and among anthem, cigna and anthem merger sub corp., a delaware corporation and our direct wholly-owned subsidiary, pursuant to which we will acquire all outstanding shares of cigna, or the acquisition. this acquisition will further our goal of creating a premier health benefits company with critical diversification and scale to lead the transformation of health care delivery for consumers. cigna is a global health services organization that delivers affordable and personalized products and services to customers through employer-based, government-sponsored and individual coverage arrangements. all of cigna's products and services are provided exclusively by or through its operating subsidiaries, including connecticut general life insurance company, cigna health and life insurance company, life insurance company of north america and cigna life insurance company of new york. such products and services include an integrated suite of health services, such as medical, dental, behavioral health, pharmacy, vision, supplemental benefits, and other related products including group life, accident and disability insurance. cigna maintains sales capability in 30 countries and jurisdictions.
under the terms of the merger agreement, cigna's shareholders will receive $103.40 in cash and 0.5152 shares of our common stock for each cigna common share outstanding. the value of the transaction is estimated to be approximately $53,000.0 based on the closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on july 23, 2015. the final purchase price will be determined based on our closing stock price on the date of closing of the acquisition. the combined company will reflect a pro forma equity ownership comprised of approximately 67% anthem shareholders and approximately 33% cigna shareholders. we expect to finance the cash portion of the acquisition through available cash on
hand and the issuance of new debt. we are party to a bridge facility commitment letter and a joinder agreement with a group of lenders which provides up to $19,500.0 under a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan credit facility to finance the acquisition in the event that we have not received proceeds from any combination of (i) senior unsecured term loans, (ii) common or preferred equity or equity-linked securities and/or (iii) senior unsecured notes in a public offering or private placement in an aggregate principal amount of at least $19,500.0 prior to the consummation of the acquisition. in addition, in august 2015, we entered into a term loan facility which will provide up to $4,000.0 to finance a portion of the acquisition. the commitment of the lenders to provide the bridge facility and the term loan facility is subject to several conditions, including the completion of the acquisition. we expect that our pro forma debt-to-capital ratio will approximate 49% following the closing of the acquisition and we are committed to deleveraging to the low 40% range approximately twenty-four months following the closing. we also expect to maintain our common stock dividend and we will maintain flexibility with our share repurchase program. the acquisition is subject to certain state regulatory approvals, other standard closing conditions and customary approvals required under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act. for additional information, see "risk factors" included in part i, item 1a; and note 3, "business acquisitions and divestiture - pending acquisition of cigna corporation" included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
in july 2016, the u.s. department of justice, or doj, along with certain state attorneys general, filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the u.s. district court for the district of columbia, or district court, seeking to block the acquisition. trial commenced in november 2016 and concluded in january 2017. on january 18, 2017, we provided notice to cigna that we had elected to extend the termination date under the merger agreement from january 31, 2017 until april 30, 2017. on february 8, 2017, the district court ruled in favor of the doj, and following our motion to expedite the appeal, which was granted on february 17, 2017, we promptly appealed the district court's ruling to the u.s. circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit, or the appellate court. on february 14, 2017, cigna purported to terminate the merger agreement and commenced litigation against us in the delaware court of chancery, or delaware court, seeking damages and a declaratory judgment that its purported termination of the merger agreement was lawful, among other claims. we believe cigna's allegations are without merit. also on february 14, 2017, we initiated our own litigation against cigna in the delaware court seeking a temporary restraining order to enjoin cigna from terminating the merger agreement, specific performance compelling cigna to comply with the merger agreement and damages. on february 15, 2017, the delaware court granted our motion for a temporary restraining order and issued an order enjoining cigna from terminating the merger agreement. the temporary restraining order became effective immediately and will remain in place pending any further order from the delaware court. a hearing will be scheduled the week of april 10, 2017. we intend to vigorously defend the acquisition in both the circuit court and the delaware court and remain committed to completing the acquisition as soon as practicable. if the merger agreement is terminated because the required regulatory approvals cannot be obtained, under certain conditions, we could be obligated to pay a $1,850.0 termination fee to cigna.
on february 17, 2015, we completed our acquisition of simply healthcare holdings, inc., or simply healthcare, a leading managed care company for people enrolled in medicaid and medicare programs in the state of florida. this acquisition aligns with our strategy for continued growth in our government business segment. for additional information about this acquisition, see note 3, "business acquisitions and divestiture - acquisition of simply healthcare" included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
the future results of our operations will also be impacted by certain external forces and resulting changes in our business model and strategy. in 2010, the patient protection and affordable care act, or aca, as well as the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010, or collectively, health care reform, became law, causing significant changes to the u.s. health care system. since then, significant regulations have been enacted by the u.s. department of health and human services, or hhs, the department of labor and the department of the treasury. the legislation and regulations are far-reaching and are intended to expand access to health insurance coverage over time by mandating that most individuals obtain health insurance coverage, increasing the eligibility thresholds for most state medicaid programs and providing certain individuals and small businesses with tax credits to subsidize a portion of the cost of health insurance coverage. as a result of the complexity of the law, its impact on health care in the united states, the continuing modification and interpretation of health care reform rules and the potential for significant future changes to the law, we continue to analyze and refine our estimates of the ultimate impact of health care reform on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. health care reform presented us with new growth opportunities, but also introduced new risks, regulatory challenges and uncertainties, and required changes in the way products are designed, underwritten, priced, distributed and administered. changes to our business are likely to continue for the next several years as elected officials at the national and state level have proposed significant modification to existing laws and regulations, including the potential repeal or
replacement of health care reform. for additional discussion, see part i, item 1 "business - regulation," and part i, item 1a "risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k.
pricing in our commercial and specialty business segment, including our individual and small group lines of business, remains competitive and we strive to price our health care benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends. we believe our pricing strategy, based on predictive modeling, proprietary research and data-driven processes have positioned us to benefit from the potential growth opportunities available in fully-insured commercial products as a result of health care reform and any subsequent changes to the current regulatory scheme. in the individual and small group markets, we offer on-exchange products through state or federally facilitated marketplaces, referred to as public exchanges, and off-exchange products. federal premium subsidies are available for certain members, subject to income and family size, who purchase public exchange products. we believe that our pricing strategy, brand name and network quality will provide a strong foundation for commercial risk membership growth opportunities in the future.
in our individual markets we offer bronze, silver and gold products, both on and off the public exchanges, in california, colorado, connecticut, georgia, indiana, kentucky, maine, missouri, nevada, new hampshire, new york, ohio, virginia and wisconsin. additionally, we offer platinum products, both on and off the public exchanges, in california and new york.
in our small group markets, we offer bronze, silver and gold products, off the public exchanges, in california, colorado, connecticut, georgia, indiana, kentucky, maine, missouri, nevada, new hampshire, new york, ohio, virginia and wisconsin. we offer platinum products, off the public exchanges, in california, colorado, connecticut, georgia, indiana, kentucky, new york, virginia and wisconsin. we offer bronze, silver and gold products, on the public exchanges, in colorado, connecticut, georgia, indiana, kentucky, maine, missouri, nevada, new hampshire, ohio and virginia. additionally, we offer platinum products on the public exchange in connecticut.
private exchanges have gained visibility in the marketplace based on the promise of helping employers reduce costs, increase consumer engagement and manage the complexities created by the aca and other market forces. while private exchanges have been a distribution channel in the medicare and individual markets for some time, in more recent years the commercial market has received an increased level of attention from the consulting and broker communities as well as health insurance carriers. in response, we have continued our broad-based strategy of offering anthem health marketplace's consumer experience platform to groups, while also participating in four large national consultant-led exchanges, several regional broker-led exchanges and various individual, commercial and medicare exchanges. to date, adoption levels in the commercial market overall have been lower than analyst predictions. while the ultimate volume, pace of growth and winning business models remain highly uncertain in this space, we continue to believe we are well positioned to adapt with the market as it evolves.
health care reform imposes regulations on the health insurance sector, including, but not limited to, guaranteed coverage and expanded benefit requirements; prohibitions on some annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf of or to our members; increased restrictions on rescinding coverage; establishment of minimum medical loss ratio, or mlr, and customer rebate requirements; establishment of a mandatory annual health insurance provider fee, or hip fee; creation of a federal rate review process; a requirement to cover preventive services on a first dollar basis; the establishment of public exchanges and essential benefit packages and greater limitations on how we price certain of our products. in addition, the legislation reduces the reimbursement levels for our health plans participating in the medicare advantage program over time and limits the amount of executive compensation that is deductible for income tax purposes.
as a result of health care reform, hhs issued mlr regulations that require us to meet minimum mlr thresholds for large group, small group and individual lines of business. plans that do not meet the minimum thresholds will have to pay a mlr rebate. for purposes of determining mlr rebates, hhs has defined the types of costs that should be included in the mlr rebate calculation. however, certain components of the mlr calculation as defined by hhs cannot be classified consistently under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap. while considered benefit expense or a reduction of premium revenue by hhs, certain of these costs are classified as other types of expense, such as income tax expense or general and administrative expense, in our gaap basis financial statements. accordingly, the benefit expense ratio determined using our consolidated gaap operating results is not comparable to the mlr calculated under hhs regulations.
health care reform also imposed a separate minimum mlr threshold of 85% for medicare advantage and medicare part d plans beginning in 2014. medicare advantage or medicare part d plans that do not meet this threshold will have to pay a minimum mlr rebate. if a plan's mlr is below 85% for three consecutive years beginning with 2014, enrollment will
be restricted. a medicare advantage or medicare part d plan contract will be terminated if the plan's mlr is below 85% for five consecutive years.
beginning in 2014, health care reform imposed an annual hip fee on health insurers that write certain types of health insurance on u.s. risks. the annual hip fee is allocated to health insurers based on the ratio of the amount of an insurer's net premium revenues written during the preceding calendar year to an adjusted amount of health insurance for all u.s. health risk for those certain lines of business written during the preceding calendar year. the hip fee is non-deductible for federal income tax purposes. the total amount collected from allocations to health insurers was $11,300.0 for each of 2016 and 2015 and $8,000.0 for 2014. we record our estimated liability for the hip fee in full at the beginning of the year with a corresponding deferred asset that is amortized on a straight-line basis to general and administrative expense. the final calculation and payment of the annual hip fee occurs in the third quarter each year and our portion of the hip fee for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $1,176.3, $1,207.5 and $893.3, respectively. the annual hip fee to be allocated to all health insurers has been suspended for 2017 and is scheduled to resume and be increased to $14,300.0 for 2018, without subsequent legislative or regulatory action. for 2019 and beyond, the annual hip fee will equal the amount for the preceding year increased by the rate of premium growth for the preceding year less the rate of growth in the consumer price index for the preceding calendar year.
these and other provisions of health care reform are likely to have significant effects on our future operations, which, in turn, could impact the value of our business model and results of operations, including potential impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets. we will continue to evaluate the impact of health care reform including any substantial changes to existing laws or regulations that may impact our business. for additional discussion regarding health care reform, see part i, item 1 "business-regulation" and part i, item 1a "risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k.
finally, federal and state regulatory agencies may further restrict our ability to obtain new product approvals, implement changes in premium rates or impose additional restrictions, under new or existing laws that could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
we are also subject to regulations that may result in assessments under state insurance guaranty association laws. the national organization of life & health insurance guaranty associations, or nolhga, is a voluntary organization consisting of the state life and health insurance guaranty associations located throughout the u.s. such associations, working together with nolhga, provide a safety net for their state's policyholders, ensuring that they continue to receive coverage, subject to state maximum limits, even if their insurer is declared insolvent. in 2009, the pennsylvania insurance commissioner placed penn treaty network america insurance company and its subsidiary american network insurance company, or collectively penn treaty, in rehabilitation, an intermediate action before insolvency. after failing to develop a viable rehabilitation plan, the pennsylvania insurance commissioner filed a petition to convert the rehabilitation to a liquidation, with the liquidation expected to commence following the coordination of certain scheduling matters. when penn treaty is placed in liquidation, we and other insurers will be obligated to pay a portion of their policyholder claims through state guaranty association assessments in future periods. at december 31, 2016, we estimate our portion of the assessments for the penn treaty insolvency will approximate $190.0 to $220.0. in accordance with fasb guidance, the ultimate amount of the assessments will be recognized as an expense in the period in which a court ordered liquidation is entered. payment of the assessments will be largely recovered through premium billing surcharges and premium tax credits over future years.
in addition to the external forces discussed in the preceding paragraphs, our results of operations are impacted by levels and mix of membership. in recent years, we have experienced membership growth due to the quality and pricing of our health benefits products and services, improved economic conditions, decreases in unemployment, acquisitions, entry into new markets and expansions in existing markets. in addition, we believe the self-insured portion of our group membership base will continue to increase as a percentage of total group membership. however, these membership trends could be negatively impacted by various factors that could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations such as general economic downturns that result in business failures, failure to obtain new customers or retain existing customers, premium increases, benefit changes or our exit from a specific market. further, our mix of membership may include more individuals with a higher acuity level obtaining coverage through our products available on the public exchanges, which may not be appropriately adjusted for in our premium rates.
in february 2015, we reported that we were the target of a sophisticated external cyber attack. the attackers gained unauthorized access to certain of our information technology systems and obtained personal information related to many individuals and employees. we have continued to implement security enhancements since this incident. for additional information about the cyber attack, see note 13, "commitments and contingencies - cyber attack incident," to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
also see part i, item 1a "risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k, for a discussion of the factors identified above and other risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this annual report on form 10-k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time.
executive summary we are one of the largest health benefits companies in the united states in terms of medical membership, serving 39.9 medical members through our affiliated health plans as of december 31, 2016. we are an independent licensee of the blue cross and blue shield association, or bcbsa, an association of independent health benefit plans. we serve our members as the blue cross licensee for california and as the blue cross and blue shield, or bcbs, licensee for colorado, connecticut, georgia, indiana, kentucky, maine, missouri (excluding 30 counties in the kansas city area), nevada, new hampshire, new york (as bcbs in 10 new york city metropolitan and surrounding counties, and as blue cross or bcbs in selected upstate counties), ohio, virginia (excluding the northern virginia suburbs of washington, d.c.) and wisconsin. in a majority of these service areas we do business as anthem blue cross, anthem blue cross and blue shield, blue cross and blue shield of georgia, and empire blue cross blue shield or empire blue cross (in our new york service areas). we also conduct business through arrangements with other bcbs licensees in south carolina and western new york. through our amerigroup corporation, or amerigroup, subsidiary, we conduct business in florida, georgia, iowa, kansas, louisiana, maryland, nevada, new jersey, new mexico, new york, tennessee, texas, and washington. in addition, we conduct business through our simply healthcare holdings, inc., or simply healthcare, subsidiary in florida. we also serve customers throughout the country as healthlink, unicare (including a non-risk arrangement with massachusetts), and in certain arizona, california, nevada and virginia markets through our caremore health group, inc., or caremore, subsidiary. we are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states through our subsidiaries.
on january 31, 2014, we sold our 1-800 contacts, inc. business and our glasses.com related assets, or collectively, 1-800 contacts. the operating results for 1-800 contacts for the one month ended january 31, 2014 are reported as discontinued operations within the consolidated statements of income included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. these results were previously reported in the commercial and specialty business segment. unless otherwise specified, all financial information disclosed in this md&a is from continuing operations, other than net income, diluted earnings per share and cash flows. in accordance with fasb guidance, we have elected to not separately disclose net cash provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities and the net effect of those cash flows on cash and cash equivalents for discontinued operations during the periods presented. for additional information regarding these transactions, see note 3, "business acquisitions and divestiture - divestiture of 1-800 contacts," to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
operating revenue for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $84,194.0, an increase of $5,789.2, or 7.4%, from the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase in operating revenue was primarily a result of higher premium revenue in both our government business and commercial and specialty business segments, and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees in our commercial and specialty business segment. these increases were partially offset by lower administrative fees in our government business segment.
net income for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $2,469.8, a decrease of $90.2, or 3.5%, from the year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease in net income was primarily due to lower operating results in our government business segment, an increase in transaction costs associated with our pending acquisition of cigna, a decrease in net earnings from investment activities and an increase in interest expense.
our diluted earnings per share, or eps, for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $9.21, a decrease of $0.17, or 1.8%, from the year ended december 31, 2015. our diluted shares for the year ended december 31, 2016 were 268.1, a decrease of 4.8, or 1.8% compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease in eps resulted from the decrease in net income, partially offset by the impact of a lower number of shares outstanding in 2016.
operating cash flow for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $3,204.5, or 1.3 times net income. operating cash flow for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $4,116.0, or 1.6 times net income. the decrease in operating cash flow from 2015 of $911.5 was primarily attributable to an increase in claims payments due to higher medical cost experience and growth in membership. the decrease was further due to the timing of claim reimbursements from our self-insured customers. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in premium receipts as a result of rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and growth in membership. the decrease was further offset by an increase in pharmacy rebates received.
our results of operations discussed throughout this md&a are determined in accordance with gaap. we also calculate operating revenue and operating gain to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing our core operating results and comparing them among periods. we define operating revenue as premium income, administrative fees and other revenues. operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, and selling, general and administrative expense. we use these measures as a basis for evaluating segment performance, allocating resources, forecasting future operating performance and setting incentive compensation targets. this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income before income tax expense, net income or eps prepared in accordance with gaap, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. for additional details on operating gain, see our "reportable segments results of operations" discussion included in this md&a. for a reconciliation of reportable segment operating revenue to the amounts of total revenue included in the consolidated statements of income and a reconciliation of reportable segment operating gain to income from continuing operations before income tax expense, see note 19, "segment information," to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
we intend to expand through a combination of organic growth, strategic acquisitions, including the pending acquisition of cigna, and efficient use of capital in both existing and new markets. our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of additional economies of scale as well as providing us access to new and evolving technologies and products. in addition, we believe geographic and product diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for growth. while we have achieved strong growth as a result of strategic mergers and acquisitions, we have also achieved organic growth in our existing markets over time by delivering excellent service, offering competitively priced products, providing access to high quality provider networks and effectively capitalizing on the brand strength of the blue cross and blue shield names and marks.
significant transactions while health care reform has caused significant changes to the u.s. health care system in recent years, the significant transactions that have occurred over the last three years that have impacted or will impact our capital structure or that have or will influence how we conduct our business operations include:
•   pending acquisition of cigna;
•   acquisition of simply healthcare (2015);
•   board of directors declaration of dividends on common stock (2014 through february 2017); authorization for repurchases of our common stock (2017 and prior); and debt repurchases and new debt issuance (2015 and prior); and
•   divestiture of 1-800 contacts (2014).
for additional information regarding these transactions, see note 3, "business acquisitions and divestiture," note 12, "debt" and note 14, "capital stock," to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
membership our medical membership includes seven different customer types: local group, individual, national accounts, bluecard®, medicare, medicaid and fep. bcbs-branded business generally refers to members in our service areas licensed by the bcbsa. non-bcbs-branded business refers to amerigroup, caremore and simply healthcare members as well as healthlink and unicare members predominantly outside of our bcbsa service areas.
•   local group consists of those employer customers with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state, as well as customers with more than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state with up to 5,000 eligible employees. in addition, local group includes unicare members and employer group medicare advantage members, or retired members of local group accounts who have selected a medicare advantage product. local group accounts are generally sold through brokers or consultants working with industry specialists from our in-house sales force and are offered both on and off the public exchanges. local group insurance premiums may be based on claims incurred by the group or sold on a self-insured basis. the customer's buying decision is typically based upon the size and breadth of our networks, customer service, the quality of our medical management services, the administrative cost included in our quoted price, our financial stability, reputation and our ability to effectively service large complex accounts. local group accounted for 38.7%, 39.5% and 40.4% of our medical members at december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
•   individual consists of individual customers under age 65 and their covered dependents. individual policies are generally sold through independent agents and brokers, retail partnerships, our in-house sales force or via the internet. individual business is sold on a fully-insured basis. we offer on-exchange products through public exchanges and off-exchange products. federal premium subsidies are available only for certain public exchange individual products. individual customers are generally more sensitive to product pricing and, to a lesser extent, the configuration of the network, and the efficiency of administration. customer turnover is generally higher with individual as compared to local group. individual business accounted for 4.2%, 4.3% and 4.8% of our medical members at december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
•   national accounts generally consist of multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in an anthem service area with at least 5% of the eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state and with more than 5,000 eligible employees. some exceptions are allowed based on broker and consultant relationships. service area is defined as the geographic area in which we are licensed to sell bcbs products. national accounts are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer working with our in-house sales force. we believe we have an advantage when competing for very large national accounts due to the size and breadth of our networks and our ability to access the national provider networks of bcbs companies at their competitive local market rates. in addition, employer group medicare advantage members related to national accounts groups are reported as part of national accounts membership. the employer group medicare advantage members represent less than 1.0% of national accounts membership. national accounts represented 19.4%, 19.1% and 19.1% of our medical members at december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
•   bluecard® host customers represent enrollees of blue cross and/or blue shield plans not owned by anthem who receive health care services in our bcbsa licensed markets. bluecard® membership consists of estimated host members using the national bluecard® program. host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which an anthem subsidiary is the blue cross and/or blue shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-anthem controlled bcbsa licensee (i.e., the "home plan"). we perform certain administrative functions for bluecard® members, for which we receive administrative fees from the bluecard® members' home plans. other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of bluecard® claims received per month. bluecard® host membership accounted for 13.9%, 14.0% and 14.1% of our medical members at december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
•   medicare customers are medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in medicare advantage, a managed care alternative for the medicare program, who have purchased medicare supplement benefit coverage, some disabled members under age 65, or members of all ages with end stage renal disease. we also include in the medicare category members enrolled in our dual eligible medicare-medicaid plans, or mmps, in the states where we participate. medicare supplement policies are sold to medicare recipients as supplements to the benefits they receive from the medicare program. rates are filed with and in some cases approved by state insurance
departments. most of the premium for medicare advantage is paid directly by the federal government on behalf of the participant who may also be charged a small premium. medicare supplement and medicare advantage products are marketed in the same manner, primarily through independent agents and brokers. medicare business accounted for 3.6%, 3.7% and 3.7% of our medical members at december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
•   medicaid membership represents eligible members who receive health care benefits through publicly funded health care programs, including medicaid, tanf, spd, ltss, chip and medicaid expansion programs. total medicaid program business accounted for 16.4%, 15.3% and 13.8% of our medical members at december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
•   fep members consist of united states government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the bcbsa and the u.s. office of personnel management. fep business accounted for 3.9%, 4.1% and 4.1% of our medical members at december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
in addition to reporting our medical membership by customer type, we report by funding arrangement according to the level of risk that we assume in the product contract. our two principal funding arrangement categories are fully-insured and self-funded. fully-insured products are products in which we indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. self-funded products are offered to customers, generally larger employers, who elect to retain most or all of the financial risk associated with their employees' health care costs. some self-funded customers choose to purchase stop loss coverage to limit their retained risk.
the following table presents our medical membership by customer type, funding arrangement and reportable segment as of december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. also included below is other membership by product. the medical membership and other membership presented are unaudited and in certain instances include estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period.

fully-insured membership increased 298, or 2.0%, primarily due to growth in our medicaid business, partially offset by declines in local group fully-insured membership.
local group membership increased 188, or 1.2%, primarily due to growth in our large group self-funded accounts as a result of new sales and conversions of fully-insured contracts to self-funded administrative service only, or aso contracts. the increase was partially offset by attrition in our fully-insured product offerings resulting from competitive pressures and conversions to self-funded aso contracts.
individual membership decreased 11, or 0.7%, primarily due to attrition in non-aca-compliant product offerings, partially offset by growth in aca-compliant off- and on-exchange product offerings.
bluecard® membership increased 143, or 2.6%, primarily due to higher membership activity at other bcbsa plans whose members reside in or travel to our licensed areas.
medicare membership decreased 1, or 0.1%, primarily due to membership losses from strategic market exits, partially offset by growth in certain existing markets.
medicaid membership increased 613, or 10.4%, primarily due to new business expansions and organic growth in existing markets.
our other products are often ancillary to our health business and can therefore be impacted by corresponding changes in our medical membership.
life and disability membership decreased 117, or 2.4%, primarily due to higher lapses in our fully-insured local group business.
medicare advantage part d membership increased 7, or 1.1%, primarily due to higher sales during the open enrollment period.
medicare part d standalone membership decreased 21, or 5.7%, primarily due to our product repositioning strategies and select strategic actions in certain markets.
fully-insured membership increased 234, or 1.6%, primarily due to growth in our medicaid and medicare businesses including membership acquired with the acquisition of simply healthcare, and increased sales in our individual business aca-compliant on- and off-exchange product offerings. these increases were partially offset by local group fully-insured membership declines, largely driven by conversions of fully-insured contracts to self-funded aso contracts and our decision to exit the georgia employer group medicare product offering. the increase was further offset by attrition in our individual business non-aca-compliant product offerings.
local group membership increased 104, or 0.7%, primarily due to increases in our self-funded accounts. the increase in membership was partially offset by attrition in our small group line of business resulting from product mix changes as members moved into health care reform product offerings and competitive pressures. the increase was further offset by fully-insured membership declines resulting from our decision to exit the georgia employer group medicare product offering.
individual membership decreased 118, or 6.6%, primarily due to attrition in non-aca-compliant product offerings, partially offset by increased sales in aca-compliant on- and off-exchange product offerings.

cost of care the following discussion summarizes our aggregate underlying cost of care trends for the year ended december 31, 2016 for our local group fully-insured business only.
our cost of care trends are calculated by comparing the year-over-year change in average per member per month claim costs. while our cost of care trend varies by geographic location, based on underlying medical cost trends, we estimate that our aggregate cost of care trend was in the lower end of the 7.0% to 7.5% range for the full year of 2016. we anticipate that medical cost trends will be in the range of 6.5% to 7.0% in 2017.
outpatient and professional utilization have been consistent with prior years. inpatient and pharmacy utilization have been lower than in prior years. consistent with prior years, provider rate increases were a primary driver of medical cost trends. we continually negotiate with hospitals and physicians to manage these cost trends. we commonly negotiate multi-year contracts with hospitals and physicians, minimizing annual fluctuations in medical cost trend. we remain committed to optimizing our reimbursement rates and strategies to help address the cost pressures faced by employers and consumers. unit cost increases, as well as increases in high cost specialty drug offerings and usage, were also a driver of pharmacy cost. for example, high cost hepatitis c drug therapies continued to put upward pressure on pharmacy trend. we have negotiated to lower the cost of these hepatitis c drug therapies and continue to review clinical appropriateness of these new hepatitis c drug therapies to ensure members receive the most appropriate treatment and length of therapy.
in response to cost trends, we continue to pursue contracting and plan design changes, promote and implement performance-based contracts that reward clinical outcomes and quality, and expand care management programs. we are taking a leadership role in the area of payment reform as evidenced by our enhanced personal health care program. by establishing the primary care doctor as central to the coordination of a patient's health care needs, the initiative builds on the success of current patient-centered medical home programs in helping to improve patient care while lowering costs.
a number of clinical management initiatives are in place to help mitigate inpatient trend. focused review efforts continue in key areas, including targeting outlier facilities for length of stay and readmission, and high risk maternity and neonatal intensive care unit cases, as noted below. additionally, we continue to refine our programs related to readmission management, focused behavioral health readmission reduction and post-discharge follow-up care.
•   neonatal intensive care unit focused review - collaborative teams focus on developing a comprehensive plan of care and safe and effective discharge planning so that individuals can be released from the neonatal intensive care unit as soon as medically appropriate.
outpatient costs are a collection of different types of expenses, such as outpatient facilities, labs, x-rays, emergency room, occupational and physical therapy and many others. example programs developed to mitigate outpatient costs are as follows:
•   cancer care quality program - this program, developed in collaboration with our subsidiary aim specialty health, identifies certain cancer treatment pathways selected based upon current medical evidence, peer-reviewed published literature, consensus guidelines and our clinical policies to support oncologists in identifying cancer treatment therapies that are highly effective and provide greater value.
•   avoidable emergency room visits - this program seeks to help educate members and providers about potentially avoidable emergency room visits. phone calls and mailings are used to inform members of alternate sites of care, such as primary care physicians, urgent care facilities, and walk-in doctor's offices that can replace visits to the emergency room in certain situations.
•   specialty drug site of care - this program, when clinically appropriate and safe, uses clinical site of care review to encourage utilization of certain specialty drugs in more effective settings such as physician offices, ambulatory infusion suites and in the home using home infusion therapy.
•   fraud and abuse - this program, through investigation and identification of providers with an invalid medical license and/or expired prescribing privileges, seeks to prevent improper payment of medical or pharmacy claims.

2   the operating results of 1-800 contacts are reported as discontinued operations as a result of the divestiture completed on january 31, 2014.
4   benefit expense ratio represents benefit expense as a percentage of premium revenue. premiums for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $78,860.1, $73,385.1 and $68,389.8, respectively. premiums are included in total operating revenue presented above.
total operating revenue increased $5,789.2, or 7.4%, to $84,194.0 in 2016, resulting primarily from higher premiums, and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees. higher premiums were largely due to rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends. the increase was further attributable to membership increases in our medicaid and aca-compliant off- and on-exchange individual business product offerings. additionally, adjustments to accruals for the health care reform risk adjustment premium stabilization program and increased reimbursed benefit utilization in our fep business contributed to the increase in premiums. the increase in premiums was partially offset by the declines in fully-insured membership in our small group business and lapses in non-aca-compliant individual business product offerings. the increase in administrative fees primarily resulted from membership growth and rate increases for self-funded members in our national accounts and large group businesses.
net investment income increased $101.9, or 15.0%, to $779.5 in 2016, primarily due to higher income from alternative investments.
net realized gains on financial instruments decreased $152.6, or 96.9%, to $4.9 in 2016, primarily due to an increase in net realized losses on derivative financial instruments, largely as a result of losses recognized on options entered in to economically hedge the variability of cash flows in the interest payments on anticipated future financings. the decrease was further due to lower net realized gains on sales of equity securities. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in net realized gains on sales of fixed maturity securities.
other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments increased $32.0, or 38.4%, to $115.4 in 2016, primarily due to an increase in impairment losses on fixed maturity securities, partially offset by a decrease in impairment losses on equity securities.
benefit expense increased $5,717.5, or 9.4%, to $66,834.4 in 2016, primarily due to increased costs as a result of overall cost trends across our businesses. the increase was further attributable to membership growth in our medicaid business and aca-compliant off- and on-exchange individual business product offerings. these increases were partially offset by the declines in fully-insured membership in our small group business and non-aca-compliant individual business product offerings.
our benefit expense ratio increased 150 basis points to 84.8% in 2016. the increase in the ratio was largely driven by our medicaid business due to increases in medical cost experience that exceeded the impact of premium rate adjustments, higher than expected medical cost experience in the iowa market, which we began serving in 2016, and increases in membership as our medicaid business has a higher benefit expense ratio than our consolidated average. the increase in the ratio was further due to higher medical costs experience in our individual and local group businesses. these increases were partially offset by adjustments to estimates of prior year accruals related to the health care reform risk adjustment premium stabilization program and improved medical cost performance in our medicare business.
selling, general and administrative expense was $12,557.9 and $12,534.8 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased 110 basis points to 14.9% in 2016. the decrease in the ratio was primarily a result of lower costs related to expense efficiency initiatives and the increase in operating revenue, including the impact of medicaid membership growth in our government business segment, which has a lower selling, general and administrative expense ratio than our consolidated average.
other expense increased $41.5, or 4.7%, to $915.3 in 2016, primarily due to higher interest expense in 2016 driven by amortization of the fees incurred for the bridge facility commitment letter and joinder agreement entered into during the third quarter of 2015 to partially fund the pending acquisition of cigna. the increase in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets.
income tax expense increased $14.6, or 0.7%, to $2,085.6 in 2016. the effective tax rates in 2016 and 2015 were 45.8% and 44.7%, respectively. the increase in income tax expense and the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in non-deductible costs incurred associated with the pending acquisition of cigna and the increase in our california deferred state tax expense resulting from recent california legislation related to managed care organizations. the increase was further due to favorable 2015 tax adjustments related to state audit settlements. these increases were partially offset by the
non-recurring impact of an adverse california franchise tax ruling recognized in 2015 and a decrease in income before income tax expense.
our net income as a percentage of total revenue decreased 30 basis points to 2.9% in 2016 as compared to 2015 as a result of all factors discussed above.
total operating revenue increased $5,383.1, or 7.4% to $78,404.8 in 2015, resulting primarily from higher premiums, and, to a lesser extent, increased administrative fees. higher premiums were mainly due to membership increases across our government business segment, including membership obtained through the acquisition of simply healthcare, and rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and the increase in the hip fee. the increase in premiums was further attributable to membership increases in our aca-compliant on- and off-exchange individual business product offerings and refinement of estimates associated with medicare risk score revenue in the prior year. the increase in premiums was offset, in part, by the fully-insured membership declines in our local group business, attrition in non-aca-compliant individual business product offerings and adjustments to accruals for the health care reform risk adjustment premium stabilization program. the increase in administrative fees primarily resulted from rate increases and membership growth for self-funded members in our local group and national accounts businesses.
net investment income decreased $46.8, or 6.5%, to $677.6 in 2015, primarily due to lower income from alternative investments, partially offset by higher investment yields on fixed maturity securities.
net realized gains on financial instruments decreased $19.5, or 11.0%, to $157.5 in 2015, primarily due to an increase in net realized losses on sales of fixed maturity securities, partially offset by an increase in net realized gains on sales of equity securities and settlements of derivative financial instruments.
other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments increased $34.4, or 70.2%, to $83.4 in 2015, primarily due to an increase in impairment losses on equity and fixed maturity securities.
benefit expense increased $4,262.0, or 7.5%, to $61,116.9 in 2015, primarily due to increase in overall cost trends across our businesses, membership growth across our government business segment, including membership obtained through the acquisition of simply healthcare, and membership growth in our aca-compliant on- and off-exchange individual business product offerings. these increases were partially offset by the fully-insured membership declines in our local group business and non-aca-compliant individual business product offerings, as described above.
our benefit expense ratio increased 20 basis points to 83.3% in 2015, largely driven by changes in the mix of the product portfolio, higher than expected medical costs in our individual business, and adjustments to accruals related to the health care reform risk adjustment premium stabilization program. these increases were partially offset by improvement in our local group business and certain medicare lines of business predominantly due to improved medical cost performance. the increase in the ratio was further offset by refinement of estimates associated with medicare risk score revenue in the prior year.
selling, general and administrative expense increased $786.4, or 6.7%, to $12,534.8 in 2015. our selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased 10 basis points to 16.0% in 2015. the increase in the expense was primarily due to increased associate costs to support our growth in membership. the increase in expense was further due to net increases in health care reform fees, primarily due to an increase in the hip fee of $314.2, and increased premium taxes as a result of the growth in premiums. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in assessments related to the health care reform reinsurance premium stabilization program of $163.4. the decrease in the ratio was primarily due to the impact of medicaid membership growth in our government business segment, which has a lower selling, general and administrative expense ratio than our consolidated average.
other expense decreased $28.9, or 3.2%, to $873.8 in 2015, primarily due to changes in gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we recognized net gains on extinguishment of debt of $9.3 compared to net losses on extinguishment of debt of $81.1 for the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease in other expense was partially offset by higher interest expense in 2015 driven by higher outstanding debt balances and the amortization of fees incurred for the obtainment of the bridge facility commitment letter and joinder agreement to partially
fund the pending acquisition of cigna. the decrease in other expense was further offset by an increase in amortization of intangible assets. for additional information related to our borrowings, see "liquidity and capital resources - debt," below.
income tax expense increased $263.0, or 14.5%, to $2,071.0 in 2015. the effective tax rates in 2015 and 2014 were 44.7% and 41.4%, respectively. the increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the increase of the non-tax deductible hip fee, increased income before income taxes and increased state tax expense as a result of an adverse california franchise tax ruling. the increase in the effective tax rate for 2015 was primarily due to the increase in the non-tax deductible hip fee and the state tax impact of the adverse california franchise tax ruling.
our net income as a percentage of total revenue decreased 30 basis points to 3.2% in 2015 as compared to 2014 as a result of all factors discussed above.
reportable segments results of operations we use operating gain to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments, which are commercial and specialty business; government business; and other. operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense and selling, general and administrative expense. it does not include net investment income, net realized gains on financial instruments, other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management.
the discussion of segment results for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 presented below are based on operating gain, as described above, and operating margin, which is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. our definitions of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. for additional information, see note 19, "segment information," to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
our commercial and specialty business, government business, and other segments' summarized results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:

2   fluctuations are primarily a result of changes in unallocated corporate expenses. the increases in 2016 and 2015 were primarily due to transaction costs associated with our pending acquisition of cigna.
commercial and specialty business operating revenue increased $1,121.3, or 3.0%, to $38,692.1 in 2016, primarily due to premium rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends in our local group and individual businesses. the increase was further attributable to adjustments to accruals for the health care reform risk adjustment premium stabilization program, membership growth in our aca-compliant off- and on-exchange individual business product offerings and increased administrative fees. the increase in administrative fees was primarily due to membership growth and rate increases for self-funded members in our national accounts and self-funded large group businesses. the increase in operating revenue was partially offset by declines in fully-insured membership in our small group business and lapses in non-aca-compliant individual business product offerings.
operating gain increased $341.2, or 12.0%, to $3,195.2 in 2016, primarily due to adjustments to accruals for the health care reform risk adjustment premium stabilization program and lower selling, general and administrative expense related to expense efficiency initiatives. the increase was further attributable to membership growth in our national accounts and self-funded large group businesses. these increases were partially offset by higher medical cost experience in our individual and local group businesses and decreases in fully-insured small group membership.
the operating margin in 2016 was 8.3%, a 70 basis point increase over 2015, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs.
government business operating revenue increased $4,664.7, or 11.4%, to $45,477.7 in 2016. the increase in operating revenue was primarily due to increased premiums in our medicaid business as a result of membership growth through new business expansions and organic growth in existing markets. the increase in operating revenue was also due to rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends in our medicaid and medicare businesses and increased premiums in our fep business, due to increased reimbursed benefit utilization.
operating gain decreased $194.2, or 9.8%, to $1,784.3 in 2016, primarily due to increases in medical cost experience in our medicaid business that exceeded the impact of premium rate adjustments and higher than expected medical cost experience in the iowa medicaid market, which we began serving in 2016. these decreases were partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expense related to expense efficiency initiatives, improved medical cost performance in our medicare business and the favorable impact of a retroactive change in the minimum mlr calculation under california's medicaid expansion program.
the operating margin in 2016 was 3.9%, a 90 basis point decrease from 2015, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs.
commercial and specialty business operating revenue decreased $1,628.8, or 4.2%, to $37,570.8 in 2015, due in part to fully-insured membership declines in our large group business largely driven by the discontinuation of our georgia employer group medicare product offering. the decrease in operating revenue was further attributable to attrition in our small group line of business resulting from both product mix changes as members moved into health care reform product offerings and competitive pressures. additionally, operating revenue decreased as a result of attrition in non-aca-compliant individual business product offerings and adjustments to accruals for the health care reform risk adjustment premium stabilization program. these decreases were partially offset by premium rate increases in our individual and local group lines of business designed to cover overall cost trends and the increase in the hip fee. the decrease in operating revenue was further offset by membership growth in our aca-compliant on- and off-exchange individual business product offerings and increased administrative fees. the increase in administrative fees was primarily attributable to membership growth and rate increases for self-funded members in our large group and national accounts businesses.
operating gain decreased $406.9, or 12.5%, to $2,854.0 in 2015, primarily due to higher than expected medical costs in our individual business, membership declines in our fully-insured local group and individual lines of business and adjustments to accruals for the health care reform risk adjustment premium stabilization program. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in operating gain in our local group business primarily due to improved medical cost performance. the increase in operating gain was further offset by increases in self-funded membership in our local group and national accounts businesses.
the operating margin in 2015 was 7.6%, a 70 basis point decrease from 2014, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs.
government business operating revenue increased $7,016.6, or 20.8%, to $40,813 in 2015. the increase in operating revenue was primarily due to increased premiums in our medicaid business as a result of membership growth through commencement of operations in new markets including membership obtained through the acquisition of simply healthcare, membership growth through health care reform expansions and membership growth in existing markets. the increase in medicaid premiums was further due to rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends and the increase in the hip fee. the increase in operating revenue was further attributable to premium increases in our medicare business as a result of rate increases designed to cover overall cost trends, the acquisition of simply healthcare and refinement of estimates associated with medicare risk score revenue in the prior year. finally, increased premiums in our fep business primarily due to increased benefit utilization contributed to the increase in operating revenue.
operating gain increased $786.6, or 66.0%, to $1,978.5 in 2015, primarily due to membership growth and improved medical cost performance in certain markets in our medicaid and medicare business, and refinement of estimates associated with medicare risk score revenue in the prior year that did not recur in the current year. the increase in operating gain was further attributable to higher reimbursements for the non-tax deductible portion of the hip fee. these increases were partially offset by higher administrative costs to support our growth in membership.
the operating margin in 2015 was 4.8%, a 130 basis point increase over 2014, primarily due to the factors discussed in the preceding two paragraphs.
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap. application of gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this md&a. we consider our most important accounting policies that require significant estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medical claims payable, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. our other significant accounting policies are summarized in note 2, "basis of presentation and significant accounting policies," to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. in general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances.
medical claims payable the most subjective accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. at december 31, 2016, this liability was $7,892.6 and represented 19.7% of our total consolidated liabilities. we record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for incurred but not paid claims, including the estimated costs of processing such claims. incurred but not paid claims include (1) an estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported, as well as claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems, which approximated 96.5%, or $7,619.9, of our total medical claims liability as of december 31, 2016; and (2) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid, which approximated 3.5%, or $272.7, of the total medical claims payable as of december 31, 2016. the level of claims payable processed through our systems but not yet paid may fluctuate from one period end to the next, from approximately 1% to 5% of our total medical claims liability, due to timing of when claim payments are made.
liabilities for both claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice. actuarial standards of practice require that the claim liabilities be appropriate under moderately adverse circumstances. we determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not paid claims by following a detailed actuarial process that entails using both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. under this process, historical paid claims data is formatted into "claim triangles," which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. this information is analyzed to create "completion factors" that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. completion factors are applied to claims paid through the period end date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the period. actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims.
for the most recent incurred months (typically the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. this makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or "trend factors."
because the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. these adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations. a comparison of prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. in our comparison of prior year, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated; rather the availability of additional paid claims information drives our changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. to the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense.
we regularly review and set assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization when initially establishing claim liabilities. we continually monitor and adjust the claims liability and benefit expense based on subsequent paid claims activity. if it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. further, due to the considerable variability of health care costs, adjustments to claim liabilities occur each period and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that period. prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuary's judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued. that determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is reasonable.
while there are many factors that are used as a part of the estimation of our medical claims payable liability, the two key assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid claims liability as of december 31, 2016 were the completion and trend factors. as discussed above, these two key assumptions can be influenced by utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations.
there is variation in the reasonable choice of completion factors by duration for durations of three months through twelve months where the completion factors have the most significant impact. as previously discussed, completion factors tend to be less reliable for the most recent months and therefore are not specifically utilized for months one and two. in our analysis for the claim liabilities at december 31, 2016, the variability in months three to five was estimated to be between 40 and 90 basis points, while months six through twelve have much lower variability ranging from 0 to 30 basis points.
the difference in completion factor assumptions, assuming moderately adverse experience, results in variability of 2%, or approximately $178.0, in the december 31, 2016 incurred but not paid claims liability, depending on the completion
factors chosen. it is important to note that the completion factor methodology inherently assumes that historical completion rates will be reflective of the current period. however, it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns and therefore could fall outside the possible variations described herein.
the other major assumption used in the establishment of the december 31, 2016 incurred but not paid claim liability was the trend factors. in our analysis for the period ended december 31, 2016, there was a 320 basis point differential in the high and low trend factors assuming moderately adverse experience. this range of trend factors would imply variability of 5%, or approximately $359.0, in the incurred but not paid claims liability, depending upon the trend factors used. because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends, the trend experience for the most recent six to nine months, plus knowledge of recent events likely affecting current trends, have been taken into consideration in establishing the incurred but not paid claims liability at december 31, 2016.
see note 11, "medical claims payable," to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, for a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. in note 11, "medical claims payable," the line labeled "net incurred medical claims: prior years redundancies" accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. the impact of any reduction of "net incurred medical claims: prior years redundancies" may be offset as we establish the estimate of "net incurred medical claims: current year." our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. when we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material.
the ratio of current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net medical claims incurred was 89.1% for both 2016 and 2015 and 89.4% for 2014. this ratio serves as an indicator of claims processing speed whereby claims were processed at the same speed in 2016 and 2015. the decrease in the ratio in 2015 from 2014 reflects a decrease in claims processing speed.
we calculate the percentage of prior years' redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior years' net incurred claims payable less prior years' redundancies in the current year in order to demonstrate the development of the prior years' reserves. this metric was 14.0% for the year ended december 31, 2016, 15.1% for the year ended december 31, 2015 and 9.7% for the year ended december 31, 2014. the year ended december 31, 2016 metric reflects a slightly lower level of conservatism than the metric for the year ended december 31, 2015. the year ended december 31, 2015 metric reflects a higher level of conservatism than the metric for year ended december 31, 2014.
we calculate the percentage of prior years' redundancies in the current period as a percent of prior years' net incurred medical claims to indicate the percentage of redundancy included in the preceding year calculation of current year net incurred medical claims. we believe this calculation supports the reasonableness of our prior year estimate of incurred medical claims and the consistency in our methodology. for the year ended december 31, 2016, this metric was 1.4%, which was calculated using the redundancy of $850.4. this metric was 1.4% for 2015 and 1.0% for 2014.
the following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical claims as reported in note 11, "medical claims payable," to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, for each of 2015 and 2014 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between "net incurred medical claims - current year" for the year shown and "net incurred medical claims - prior years redundancies" for the immediately following year):
given that our business is primarily short tailed (which means that medical claims are generally paid within twelve months of the member receiving service from the provider), the variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported above, is used to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of ultimate incurred medical claims for a given calendar year with the benefit of one year of experience. we expect that substantially all of the development of the 2016 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2017.
the 2015 variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported of 0.1% was lower than the 2014 percentage of 0.5%. the lower 2015 variance was driven by a higher level of incurred claims recognized in 2015 as compared to 2014, with an approximately similar level of prior year redundancies recognized in each of the subsequent years.
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb guidance, which requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. a valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion may be unrealized. our judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance.
at each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the following:
•   the amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim;
•   the forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and
•   any significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences.
we, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. in evaluating any additional tax liability associated with various positions taken in our tax return filings, we record additional liabilities for potential adverse tax outcomes. based on our evaluation of our tax positions, we believe we have appropriately accrued for uncertain tax benefits, as required by the guidance. to the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for, our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. if we are required to pay more than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could be materially impacted.
in the ordinary course of business, we are regularly audited by federal and other tax authorities, and from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we intend to defend our positions vigorously through the federal, state and local appeals processes. we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to these matters. accordingly, although their ultimate resolution may require additional tax payments, we do not anticipate any material impact on our results of operations from these matters.
for additional information, see note 7, "income taxes," to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
goodwill and other intangible assets our consolidated goodwill at december 31, 2016 was $17,561.2 and other intangible assets were $7,964.9. the sum of goodwill and other intangible assets represented 39.2% of our total consolidated assets and 101.7% of our consolidated shareholders' equity at december 31, 2016.
we follow fasb guidance for business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets, which specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. under the guidance, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. furthermore, goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reporting units for purposes of the annual impairment test.
our impairment tests require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, which include goodwill and other intangible assets. in addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately.
we complete our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth quarter of each year. these tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, and require a significant degree of management judgment and the use of subjective assumptions. certain interim impairment tests are also performed when potential impairment indicators exist or changes in our business or other triggering events occur.
fair value is estimated using the income and market approaches for goodwill at the reporting unit level and the income approach for our indefinite lived intangible assets. use of the income and market approaches for our goodwill impairment test reflects our view that both valuation methodologies provide a reasonable estimate of fair value. the income approach is developed using assumptions about future revenue, expenses and net income derived from our internal planning process. these estimated future cash flows are then discounted. our assumed discount rate is based on our industry's weighted-average cost of capital. market valuations are based on observed multiples of certain measures including revenue, ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), and book value of invested capital (debt and equity) and include market comparisons to publicly traded companies in our industry.
we did not incur any impairment losses as a result of our 2016 annual impairment tests as the estimated fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of the carrying values as of december 31, 2016. additionally, we do not believe that the estimated fair values of our reporting units are at risk of becoming impaired in the next twelve months. however, as a result of certain provisions of health care reform, along with current economic conditions, we have experienced lower operating margins in certain lines of business. those margins could become further compressed with adverse changes in federal and state laws and regulations. as a result, the estimated fair values of certain of our reporting units with goodwill could fall below their carrying values in future periods and if that were to occur, we would be required to record impairment losses at that time.
while we believe we have appropriately allocated the purchase price of our acquisitions, this allocation requires many assumptions to be made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. in addition, estimated fair values developed based on our assumptions and judgments might be significantly different if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. if estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives in future annual impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income.
for additional information, see note 3, "business acquisitions and divestiture" and note 9, "goodwill and other intangible assets," to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
investments current and long-term available-for-sale investment securities were $19,187.4 at december 31, 2016 and represented 29.5% of our total consolidated assets at december 31, 2016. we classify fixed maturity and equity securities in our investment portfolio as "available-for-sale" or "trading" and report those securities at fair value. certain fixed maturity securities are available to support current operations and, accordingly, we classify such investments as current assets without regard to their contractual maturity. investments used to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity.
we review investment securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary. this review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. we conduct this review on a quarterly basis, using both qualitative and quantitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary. such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which a security's market value has been less than its cost, the reasons for the decline in value (i.e., credit event compared to liquidity, general credit spread widening, currency exchange rate or interest rate factors), financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, including the credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. in addition, for equity securities, we determine whether we have the intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time to allow for a
recovery of its fair value above its carrying amount. if any declines of equity securities are determined to be other-than-temporary, we charge the losses to income when that determination is made.
certain fasb other-than-temporary impairment, or otti, guidance applies to fixed maturity securities and provides guidance on the recognition, presentation of, and disclosures for ottis. if a fixed maturity security is in an unrealized loss position and we have the intent to sell the fixed maturity security, or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and is presented within the other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income line item on our consolidated statements of income. for impaired fixed maturity securities that we do not intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell such securities, but we expect that we will not fully recover the amortized cost basis, the credit component of the otti is presented within the other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income line item on our consolidated statements of income and the non-credit component of the otti is recognized in other comprehensive income. furthermore, unrealized losses entirely caused by non-credit related factors related to fixed maturity securities for which we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis continue to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.
the credit component of an otti is determined primarily by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security. the net present value is calculated by discounting our best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the fixed maturity security at the date of acquisition. for mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates are based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral including prepayment speeds, vintage, type of underlying asset, geographic concentrations, default rates, recoveries and changes in value. for all other debt securities, cash flow estimates are driven by assumptions regarding probability of default, including changes in credit ratings, and estimates regarding timing and amount of recoveries associated with a default.
we have a committee of accounting and investment associates and management that is responsible for managing the impairment review process. the current economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets.
we believe we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. however, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change our judgment regarding impairment. this could result in other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments being charged against future income. given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional, material other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments may be recorded in future periods.
in addition to available-for-sale investment securities, we held additional long-term investments of $2,240.5, or 3.4% of total consolidated assets, at december 31, 2016. these long-term investments consisted primarily of certain other equity investments, cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies and real estate. due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term.
through our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. we manage the market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits on investments in individual issuers. ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future earnings and financial position. our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $17,687.5 at december 31, 2016. the weighted-average credit rating of these securities was "a" as of december 31, 2016. included in this balance are investments in fixed maturity securities of states, municipalities and political subdivisions and investments in mortgage-backed securities of $1,301.4 and $1.8, respectively, that are guaranteed by third parties. with the exception of eighteen securities with a fair value of $7.2, these securities are all investment-grade and carry a weighted-average credit rating of "a" as of december 31, 2016. the securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors and we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of the fixed maturity securities without a guarantee, for which such information is available, was "a" as of december 31, 2016.
fair values of available-for-sale fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. these fair values are obtained primarily from third party pricing services, which generally use level i or level ii inputs for the determination of fair value in accordance with fasb guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures. we have controls in place to review the pricing services' qualifications and procedures used to determine fair values. in addition, we periodically review the pricing services' pricing methodologies, data sources and pricing inputs to ensure the fair values obtained are reasonable.
we obtain only one quoted price for each security from the pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information. for securities not actively traded, the pricing services may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. as we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform monthly analysis on the prices received from the pricing services to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. our analysis includes a review of month-to-month price fluctuations. if unusual fluctuations are noted in this review, we may obtain additional information from other pricing services to validate the quoted price. there were no adjustments to quoted market prices obtained from the pricing services during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015.
in certain circumstances, it may not be possible to derive pricing model inputs from observable market activity, and therefore, such inputs are estimated internally. such securities are designated level iii in accordance with fasb guidance. securities designated level iii at december 31, 2016 totaled $481.4 and represented approximately 2.3% of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. our level iii securities primarily consisted of certain corporate securities, equity securities and structured securities for which observable inputs were not always available and the fair values of these securities were estimated using internal estimates for inputs including, but not limited to, prepayment speeds, credit spreads, default rates and benchmark yields.
for additional information, see part ii, item 7a "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk," and part ii, item 8, note 2, "basis of presentation and significant accounting policies," note 4, "investments," and note 6, "fair value," to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
retirement benefits pension benefits we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for some of our employees. these plans are accounted for in accordance with fasb guidance for retirement benefits, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. as permitted by the guidance, we calculate the value of plan assets as described below. further, the difference between our expected rate of return and the actual performance of plan assets, as well as certain changes in pension liabilities, are amortized over future periods.
an important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. as of our december 31, 2016 measurement date, we selected a weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.95%. we use a total portfolio return analysis in the development of our assumption. factors such as past market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and equity securities, interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are considered in the assumption. the assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. peer data and an average of historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. we believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. however, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase.
this assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years, producing the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense. we apply a corridor approach to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains or losses. under this approach, only accumulated net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the average remaining service or lifetime of the
workforce as a component of pension expense. the net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense.
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our most recent measurement date. at the december 31, 2016 measurement date, the selected weighted-average discount rate was 3.77%, compared to 3.92% at the december 31, 2015 measurement date. we developed this rate using a yield curve approach. using yields available on high-quality fixed maturity securities with various maturity dates, the yield curve approach provides a "customized" rate, which is meant to match the expected cash flows of our specific benefit plans. the net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with fasb guidance.
in managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. plan assets include a diversified mix of investment grade fixed maturity securities, equity securities and alternative investments across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize the long-term return for a prudent level of risk. in addition to producing a reasonable return, the investment strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in our expense and cash flow.
other postretirement benefits we provide most associates with certain medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. we use various actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs, to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree benefits.
at our december 31, 2016 measurement date, the selected discount rate for all plans was 3.82%, compared to a discount rate of 4.01% at the december 31, 2015 measurement date. we developed this rate using a yield curve approach as described above.
the assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of pre-medicare (those who are not currently eligible for medicare benefits) other benefits at our december 31, 2016 measurement date was 8.00% for 2017 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2028. the assumed health care cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of post-medicare (those who are currently eligible for medicare benefits) other benefits at our december 31, 2016 measurement date was 6.00% for 2017 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2024. these estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future. the health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. for example, an increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would increase the postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31, 2016 by $42.2 and would increase service and interest costs by $1.8. conversely, a decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate of one percentage point would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31, 2016 by $36.2 and would decrease service and interest costs by $1.5.
for additional information regarding our retirement benefits, see note 10, "retirement benefits," to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
new accounting pronouncements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year ended december 31, 2016 that had, or are expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures, see the "recently adopted accounting guidance" and "recent accounting guidance not yet adopted" sections of note 2, "basis of presentation and significant accounting policies" to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
liquidity and capital resources introduction our cash receipts result primarily from premiums, administrative fees, investment income, other revenue, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repurchases
of our debt securities and common stock and the payment of cash dividends. cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. any future decline in our profitability would likely have an unfavorable impact on our liquidity.
we manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. we forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy.
a substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. after considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities to improve our overall investment income returns. our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. our investments are generally available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. our subsidiaries pay out excess capital annually in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations.
the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. the securities and credit markets have in the past experienced higher than normal volatility, although current market conditions are more stable. during recent years, the federal government and various governmental agencies have taken a number of steps to restore liquidity in the financial markets and to help relieve the credit crisis and strengthen the regulation of the financial services market. in addition, governments around the world have developed their own plans to provide liquidity and security in the credit markets and to ensure adequate capital in certain financial institutions.
we have a $2,500.0 commercial paper program. should commercial paper issuance be unavailable, we have the ability to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our $3,500.0 senior revolving credit facility to redeem any outstanding commercial paper upon maturity. additionally, we believe the lenders participating in our credit facility would be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations. in addition to the $3,500.0 senior revolving credit facility, we estimate that we will receive approximately $1,900.0 of dividends from our subsidiaries during 2017, which also provides further operating and financial flexibility.
the table below outlines the cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:
operating activities                                               $3,204.5                $4,116.0                $3,369.3

liquidity-year ended december 31, 2016 compared to year ended december 31, 2015
during the year ended december 31, 2016, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $3,204.5, compared to $4,116.0 for the year ended december 31, 2015, a decrease of $911.5. the decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in claims payments due to higher medical cost experience and growth in membership. the decrease was further due to the timing of claim reimbursements from our self-insured customers. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in premium receipts as a result of rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and growth in membership. the decrease was further offset by an increase in pharmacy rebates received.
net cash flow used in investing activities was $513.9 during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $1,151.5 for the year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease in cash flow used in investing activities of $637.6 was primarily due to a
decrease in cash used for the purchase of subsidiaries, as net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2015 included the purchase of simply healthcare while there were no purchases of subsidiaries during the year ended december 31, 2016. this decrease was partially offset by an increase in net purchases of investments.
net cash flow used in financing activities was $732.9 during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $2,997.4 for the year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease in cash flow used in financing activities of $2,264.5 primarily resulted from a decrease in common stock repurchases, as we did not repurchase any common stock during the year ended december 31, 2016. the decrease was further due to a decrease in net repayments of short- and long-term borrowings and changes in bank overdrafts. the decrease in cash flow used in financing activities was partially offset by changes in commercial paper borrowings, payments on debt-related derivatives in 2016, a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans and a decrease in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation.
liquidity- year ended december 31, 2015 compared to year ended december 31, 2014
during the year ended december 31, 2015, net cash flow provided by operating activities was $4,116.0, compared to $3,369.3 for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $746.7. the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in premium receipts as a result of rate increases across our businesses designed to cover overall cost trends and the hip fee, and growth in membership. the increase in cash provided by operating activities was further attributable to the receipt of the reinsurance recoveries payment related to the 2014 health care reform reinsurance premium stabilization program and payments made in 2014 that did not recur in 2015 for the adjudication of claims relating to the new york state contract conversion from our fully-insured local group business to a self-funded aso contract. the increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by an increase in claims payments, primarily as a result of membership growth, an increase in income tax payments and an increase in the annual hip fee payment.
net cash flow used in investing activities was $1,151.5 during the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $974.9 for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase in cash flow used in investing activities of $176.6 primarily resulted from changes in cash flows relating to the purchase and sale of subsidiaries. cash utilized for the purchase of subsidiaries during the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily related to the purchase of simply healthcare. during the year ended december 31, 2014, cash was provided by the sale of our 1-800 contacts business and glasses.com related assets. the increase in cash flow used in investing activities was partially offset by changes in securities lending collateral and a decrease in net purchases of investments.
net cash flow used in financing activities was $2,997.4 during the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $1,822.5 for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase in cash flow used in financing activities of $1,174.9 primarily resulted from changes in long-term borrowings as a result of net repayments of long-term borrowings during 2015 compared to net proceeds from long-term borrowings during 2014. the increase in cash flow used in financing activities was further attributable to changes in securities lending payable, changes in bank overdrafts, an increase in cash dividends paid to shareholders and a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. the increase in cash flow used in financing activities was partially offset by a decrease in common stock repurchases, an increase in net proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, an increase in net proceeds from short-term borrowings and an increase in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation.
financial condition we maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, of $25,519.0 at december 31, 2016. since december 31, 2015, total cash, cash equivalents and investments, including long-term investments, increased by $2,394.3 primarily due to cash generated from operations, an increase in bank overdrafts changes, proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans and excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. these increases were partially offset by cash dividends paid to shareholders, purchases of property and equipment, payments on debt-related derivatives and net repayments of short-term and commercial paper borrowings.
many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. certain accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities, or statutory accounting practices, differ from gaap. changes that occur in statutory
accounting practices, if any, could impact our subsidiaries' future dividend capacity. in addition, we have agreed to certain undertakings to regulatory authorities, including the requirement to maintain certain capital levels in certain of our subsidiaries.
at december 31, 2016, we held $1,445.8 of cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company, which are available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, potential future common stock repurchases and dividends to shareholders, repurchases of debt securities and debt and interest payments.
debt during the year ended december 31, 2015, we repurchased $920.0 of the aggregate principal balance of our outstanding senior convertible debentures due 2042, or the debentures. in addition, $66.6 aggregate principal balance was surrendered for conversion by certain holders in accordance with the terms and provisions of the indenture governing the debentures. we elected to settle the excess of the principal amount of the repurchases and conversions with cash for total payments of $2,055.7. we recognized a gain on the extinguishment of debt related to the debentures of $12.7, based on the fair values of the debt on the repurchase and conversion settlement dates.
on september 10, 2015, we repaid, upon maturity, the $625.0 outstanding principal balance of our 1.25% senior unsecured notes due 2015. additionally, during the year ended december 31, 2015, we repurchased $13.0 of outstanding principal balance of certain other senior unsecured notes, plus applicable premium, accrued and unpaid interest, for cash totaling $16.2. we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.4 on the repurchase of these notes.
on may 12, 2015, we issued 25.0 equity units, pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated may 6, 2015, in an aggregate principal amount of $1,250.0. each equity unit has a stated amount of $50 (whole dollars) and consists of a purchase contract obligating the holder to purchase a certain number of shares of our common stock on may 1, 2018, subject to earlier termination or settlement, for a price in cash of $50 (whole dollars); and a 5% undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 (whole dollars) principal amount of our 1.900% remarketable subordinated notes, due 2028. we received $1,228.8 in cash proceeds from the issuance of the equity units, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us, and recorded $1,250.0 in long-term debt.
on september 15, 2014, we redeemed the $500.0 outstanding principal balance of our 5.000% senior unsecured notes due 2014, plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, for cash totaling $512.3. we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.3 on the redemption of these notes.
on september 11, 2014, we redeemed the $1,097.9 outstanding principal balance of our 5.250% senior unsecured notes due 2016, plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, for cash totaling $1,178.2. we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $67.6 on the redemption of these notes.
additionally, during the year ended december 31, 2014, we repurchased $52.0 of outstanding principal amount of certain other senior unsecured notes, plus applicable premium for early redemption plus accrued and unpaid interest, for cash totaling $61.0. we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $11.2 for the year ended december 31, 2014 on the repurchase of these notes.
on august 12, 2014, we issued $850.0 of 2.250% notes due 2019, $800.0 of 3.500% notes due 2024, $800.0 of 4.650% notes due 2044, and $250.0 of 4.850% notes due 2054 under our shelf registration statement. we used the proceeds from this offering in part to fund the purchase price of the 5.000% and 5.250% senior unsecured notes discussed above, and the remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on february 15 and august 15 of each year and commenced on february 15, 2015. the notes have a call feature that allows us to redeem the notes at any time at our option and a put feature that allows a note holder to redeem the notes upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a downgrade of the notes below an investment grade rating. for additional information related to our borrowing activities, see note 12, "debt" to our audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
we calculate our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio, a non-gaap measure, from the amounts presented on our audited consolidated balance sheets included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. our debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as the sum of short-term borrowings, plus current portion of long-term debt, plus long-term debt, less current
portion, divided by the sum of short-term borrowings, plus current portion of long-term debt, plus long-term debt, less current portion, plus total shareholders' equity. we believe our debt-to-capital ratio assists investors and rating agencies in measuring our overall leverage and additional borrowing capacity. in addition, our bank covenants include a maximum debt-to-capital ratio that we cannot and did not exceed. our debt-to-capital ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio was 38.5% and 40.8% as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we expect that our pro forma debt-to-capital ratio will approximate 49% following the closing of the acquisition of cigna, and we are committed to deleveraging to the low 40% range approximately twenty-four months following the closing.
our senior debt is rated "a" by standard & poor's, "bbb" by fitch, inc., "baa2" by moody's investor service, inc. and "bbb+" by am best company, inc. following the announcement of the merger agreement, each of these rating agencies placed certain of our debt, financial strength and other credit ratings under review for a possible downgrade, however, we intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. if our credit ratings are downgraded, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by limitations on future borrowings and a potential increase in our borrowing costs.
future sources and uses of liquidity during the year ended december 31, 2015, we entered into a bridge facility commitment letter and a joinder agreement, and a term loan facility, to finance a portion of the pending acquisition of cigna. in january 2017, we reduced the amount available under the bridge facility commitment letter from $22,500.0 to $19,500.0, and extended the termination date under the merger agreement, as well as the availability for commitments under the bridge facility and term loan facility, to april 30, 2017. the commitment of the lenders to provide the bridge facility and the term loan facility is subject to several conditions, including the completion of the acquisition of cigna. for additional information, see the "overview" section included in this "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations"; and note 3, "business acquisitions and divestiture - pending acquisition of cigna corporation" included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
we have a shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. specific information regarding terms and securities being offered will be provided at the time of an offering. proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, investments in or extensions of credit to our subsidiaries and the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansion.
we have a senior revolving credit facility, or the facility, with a group of lenders for general corporate purposes. the facility provides credit up to $3,500.0 and expires on august 25, 2020. the interest rate on the facility is based on either the libor rate or a base rate plus a predetermined rate based on our public debt rating at the date of utilization. our ability to borrow under the facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants. there were no amounts outstanding under the senior revolving credit facilities at december 31, 2016 or 2015.
we have an authorized commercial paper program of up to $2,500.0, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $629.0 and $682.2, respectively, of borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program. commercial paper borrowings are classified as long-term debt as our general practice and intent is to replace short-term commercial paper outstanding at expiration with additional short-term commercial paper for an uninterrupted period extending for more than one year and we have the ability to redeem our commercial paper with borrowings under the senior revolving credit facility described above.
we are a member, through certain subsidiaries, of the federal home loan bank of indianapolis, the federal home loan bank of cincinnati and the federal home loan bank of atlanta, collectively, the fhlbs, and as a member we have the ability to obtain short-term cash advances subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, $440.0 and $540.0, respectively, were outstanding under our short-term fhlbs borrowings.
as discussed in "financial condition" above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. based upon these requirements, we are currently estimating approximately $1,900.0 of dividends to be paid to the parent company during 2017. during 2016, we received $2,688.8 of dividends from our subsidiaries.
we regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including acquisitions, common stock and debt security repurchases and dividends to shareholders. the declaration and payment of any dividends or repurchases of our common stock or debt is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon our financial condition, results of operations, future liquidity needs, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.
a summary of the cash dividend activity for the year ended december 31, 2016 is as follows:
under our board of directors' authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. on october 2, 2014, the board of directors authorized a $5,000.0 increase to the common stock repurchase program. repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. the repurchases are effected from time to time in the open market, through negotiated transactions, including accelerated share repurchase agreements, and through plans designed to comply with rule 10b5-1 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. our stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. we repurchase shares under the program when we believe it is a prudent use of capital. the excess cost of the repurchased shares over par value is charged on a pro rata basis to additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. there were no common stock repurchases during the year ended december 31, 2016. total authorization remaining at december 31, 2016 was $4,175.9 and we expect to utilize the remaining authorized amount over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions.
contractual obligations and commitments our estimated contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2016 are as follows:
other long-term liabilities2                          1,260.8                   419.6                   453.5                   302.1                        85.6
operating lease commitments                             770.5                   149.7                   258.5                   161.2                       201.1
investment commitments4                                 798.0                   324.8                   316.8                   137.3                        19.1
total contractual obligations and commitments       $29,439.5                $4,440.8                $5,628.5                $3,020.1                   $16,350.1
2   primarily consists of reserves for future policy benefits, projected other postretirement benefits, deferred compensation, supplemental executive retirement plan liabilities and certain other miscellaneous long-term obligations. estimated future payments for funded pension benefits have been excluded from this table as we had no funding requirements under erisa at december 31, 2016 as a result of the value of the assets in the plans.
3   includes estimated payments for future services under contractual arrangements from third-party service contracts.
4   includes unfunded capital commitments for alternative investments.
the above table does not contain $150.0 of gross liabilities for uncertain tax positions and interest for which we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the resolutions with the respective taxing authorities. for further information, see note 7, "income taxes," to the audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
in addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. however, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments.
we believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our senior revolving credit facility, bridge facility, term loan facility and/or from public or private financing sources, will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet derivative instruments, guarantee transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements or any indemnification agreements that will require funding in future periods. we have not transferred assets to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. we do not hold any variable interest in an unconsolidated entity where such entity provides us with financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support.
risk-based capital our regulated subsidiaries' states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital, or rbc, requirements for health and other insurance companies and health maintenance organizations largely based on the national association of insurance commissioners, or naic, rbc model act. these rbc requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer's investments and products. the naic sets forth the formula for calculating the rbc requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company's business. in general, under the rbc model act, an insurance company must submit a report of its rbc level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. our regulated subsidiaries' respective rbc levels as of december 31, 2016, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, were in excess of all mandatory rbc requirements. in addition to exceeding the rbc requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the bcbsa and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our california subsidiaries.

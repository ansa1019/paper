item 7   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
overview managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of resmed inc and subsidiaries. it is provided as a supplement to, and should be read together with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report.
we are a leading developer, manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating, diagnosing, and managing sdb and other respiratory disorders. during the fiscal year, we continued our efforts to build awareness of the consequences of untreated sdb and to grow our business in this market. in our efforts, we have attempted to raise awareness through market and clinical initiatives and by highlighting the increasing link between the potential effects sdb can have on co-morbidities such as cardiac disease, diabetes, hypertension and obesity.
there are many studies being conducted that provide new evidence that treating sdb and osa can improve health, quality of life and also mitigate the dangers of sleep apnea in occupational health and safety, especially in the transport industry. evidence continues to mount supporting the role of sdb therapy for disease prevention, improvement of quality of life and healthcare cost reduction.
we are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements. during fiscal year 2016, we invested approximately $118.7 million on research and development activities, which represents approximately 6% of net revenues. since the development of cpap, we have developed a number of innovative products for the treatment of sdb and other respiratory disorders including devices, informatics solutions, diagnostic products, mask systems, headgear and other accessories. during fiscal year 2016, we released new products including the lumis st-a, acucare high-flow nasal cannula and resmed connectivity module. in addition, through our acquisitions of inova labs and curative medical we acquired the inova labs range of pocs and a portfolio of curative medical sdb and ventilation products. in 2016, we introduced a number of new software solutions including our resmed resupply, goscripts and new features and enhancements within our cloud-based software offerings. through our acquisition of brightree, we also acquired a suite of software-as-a-service solutions for u.s. based distributors and home health and hospice customers. these products as well as the fiscal 2015 release of airsensetm 10, aircurvetm 10, lumis and airviewtm, our cloud-based remote monitoring and therapy management system, and a robust product pipeline, should continue to provide us with a strong platform for future growth.
net revenue in fiscal year 2016 increased to $1,838.7 million, an increase of 10% compared to fiscal year 2015. gross profit increased for the year ended june 30, 2016 to $1,066.5 million, from $1,011.4 million for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of $55.1 million or 5%. our net income for the year ended june 30, 2016 was $352.4 million or $2.49 per diluted share compared to net income of $352.9 million or $2.47 per diluted share for the year ended june 30, 2015.
total operating cash flow for fiscal year 2016 was $547.9 million and at june 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $731.4 million. at june 30, 2016, our total assets were $3.3 billion and our stockholders equity was $1.7 billion. during fiscal year 2016, we repurchased 1.9 million shares at a cost of $102.1 million under our share repurchase program, compared to 2.7 million shares at a cost of $152.6 million during fiscal year 2015. we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share during fiscal 2016 with a total amount of $168.1 million paid to stockholders.
in order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we provide certain financial information on a constant
currency basis, which is in addition to the actual financial information presented. in order to calculate our constant currency information, we translate the current period financial information using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period. however, constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to u.s. dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
net revenues.    net revenue for the year ended june 30, 2016 increased to $1,838.7 million from $1,678.9 million for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of $159.8 million or 10% (a 13% increase on a constant currency basis). net revenue for the year ended june 30, 2016 includes revenue of $28.9 million from brightrees operations since the closing of our acquisition of brightree. excluding revenue attributable to brightree, net revenue for the year ended june 30, 2016 was $1,809.8 million, an increase of $130.9 million or 8% compared to the year ended june 30, 2015 (an 11% increase on a constant currency basis). the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our devices, masks and accessories, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices. movements in international currencies against the u.s. dollar negatively impacted net revenues by approximately $55.6 million for the year ended june 30, 2016.
net revenue in north and latin america for the year ended june 30, 2016 increased to $1,130.4 million from $962.7 million for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of $167.7 million or 17%. excluding revenue attributable to brightree, net revenue in north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30, 2016 to $1,101.5 million, an increase of $138.8 million or 14%. the increase in net revenue in north and latin america, excluding revenue attributable to brightree, is primarily due to an increase in unit sales of our devices, masks and accessories, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices.
net revenue in markets outside north and latin america decreased for the year ended june 30, 2016 to $708.3 million from $716.2 million for the year ended june 30, 2015, a decrease of $7.9 million or 1% (a 6% increase on a constant currency basis). the constant currency increase in sales outside north and latin america predominantly reflects an increase in unit sales of our devices, masks and accessories, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices.
net revenue from devices for the year ended june 30, 2016 increased to $1,064.2 million from $975.9 million for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of $88.3 million or 9%, including an increase of 19% in north and latin america and a decrease of 1% outside north and latin america (a 6% increase on a constant currency basis). net revenue from masks and other accessories for the year ended june 30, 2016 increased to $745.6 million from $703.0 million for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of 6%, including an increase of 10% in north and latin america and a decrease of 2% outside north and latin america (a 5% increase on a constant currency basis). excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, device sales for the year ended june 30, 2016 increased by 13%, and masks and accessories sales increased by 9%, compared to the year ended june 30, 2015.
the following table summarizes the percentage movements in our net revenue, excluding revenue attributable to brightree following the closing of our acquisition, for the year ended june 30, 2016 compared to the year ended june 30, 2015:
north and latin       markets outside           total         markets outside               total america       north and                                     north and           (constant latin america                             latin america          currency)*
masks and other accessories                  10   %                  -2   %         6   %                   5   %               9   %
gross profit.    gross profit increased for the year ended june 30, 2016 to $1,066.5 million from $1,011.4 million for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of $55.1 million or 5%. gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was 58.0% for the year ended june 30, 2016, compared with the 60.2% for the year ended june 30, 2015. the decline in gross margins was primarily due to an unfavorable product mix as sales of our lower margin products represented a higher proportion of our sales, declines in our average selling prices and an unfavorable geographic mix with sales in our lower margin geographic areas representing a higher proportion of our overall sales.
selling, general and administrative expenses.    selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30, 2016 to $488.1 million from $478.6 million for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of $9.4 million or 2%. the selling, general and administrative expenses, as reported in u.s. dollars, were favorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the u.s. dollar, which decreased our expenses by approximately $25.6 million. excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30, 2016 increased by 7% compared to the year ended june 30, 2015. as a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30, 2016 was 26.5%, compared to 28.5% for the year ended june 30, 2015.
the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional personnel to support our commercial activities, increased legal expenses, acquisition expenses and incremental expenses due to the inclusion of our recent business acquisitions.
research and development expenses.    research and development expenses increased for the year ended june 30, 2016 to $118.7 million from $114.9 million for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of $3.8 million or 3%. the research and development expenses were favorably impacted by the depreciation of the australian dollar and euro against the u.s. dollar, which decreased our expenses by approximately $13.9 million, as reported in u.s. dollars. excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, research and development expenses for the year ended june 30, 2016 increased by 15% compared to the year ended june 30, 2015. as a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 6.5% for the year ended june 30, 2016 compared to 6.8% for the year ended june 30, 2015.
the increase in research and development expenses in constant currency terms was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel, an increase in materials and tooling costs incurred to facilitate development of new products and additional expenses associated with the consolidation of recent acquisitions.
restructuring expenses.    during the year ended june 30, 2016 we incurred restructuring expenses of $6.9 million associated with rationalizing our european research & development operations and manufacturing facilities. the restructure cost consisted primarily of severance payments and an asset write-down of a legacy manufacturing facility.
amortization of acquired intangible assets.    amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended june 30, 2016 totaled $23.9 million compared to $8.7 million for the year ended june 30, 2015. the increase in amortization expense was attributable to our acquisitions during the year, in particular brightree, curative medical and inova labs.
total other income, net.    total other income, net for the year ended june 30, 2016 was $10.6 million, compared with $26.7 million for the year ended june 30, 2015. the decrease in total other income, net, was due primarily to lower interest income resulting from lower interest rates on cash balances held, an increase in interest expense due to higher borrowings and reduced foreign currency hedging gains due to the depreciation of the australian dollar against the u.s. dollar and euro.
income taxes.    our effective income tax rate increased to 19.8% for the year ended june 30, 2016 from 19.0% for the year ended june 30, 2015. during the year ended june 30, 2016, we adopted the new accounting standard, asu 2016-09 improvements to employee share-based payment accounting. as a result of adopting this standard, we recognized a tax benefit of $11.2 million. the impact of this tax benefit was offset by an additional tax expense relating to an increase in our foreign cash repatriation to the u.s. our effective income tax rate is affected by the geographic mix of our taxable income, including lower taxes associated with our singapore and malaysia manufacturing operations. our singapore and malaysia operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs which will expire in whole or in part at various dates through june 30, 2020. as of june 30, 2016, we have not provided for u.s. income taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. we intend for these earnings to be permanently reinvested outside the united states.
net income and earnings per share.    as a result of the factors above, our net income for the year ended june 30, 2016 was $352.4 million compared to net income of $352.9 million for the year ended june 30, 2015. as a result of lower share count due to our stock repurchases during the year ended june 30, 2016, our earnings per share for the year ended june 30, 2016 was $2.49 per diluted share compared to $2.47 per diluted share for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of 1% over the year ended june 30, 2015.
net revenues.    net revenue increased for the year ended june 30, 2015 to $1,678.9 million from $1,555.0 million for the year ended june 30, 2014, an increase of $123.9 million or 8% (a 13% increase on a constant currency basis). the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our devices, masks and accessories, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices. movements in international currencies against the u.s. dollar negatively impacted net revenues by approximately $74.5 million for the year ended june 30, 2015.
net revenue in north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30, 2015 to $962.7 million from $839.1 million for the year ended june 30, 2014, an increase of $123.6 million or 15%. the increase in net revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in unit sales of our devices, masks and accessories, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices.
net revenue in markets outside north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30, 2015 to $716.2 million from $715.8 million for the year ended june 30, 2014, an increase of $0.4 million or 0% (a 10% increase on a constant currency basis). the constant currency increase in sales outside north and latin america predominantly reflected an increase in unit sales of our devices, masks and accessories, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices.
net revenue from devices for the year ended june 30, 2015 totaled $975.9 million from $846.7 million for the year ended june 30, 2014, an increase of 15%, including an increase of 33% in north
and latin america and an increase of 2% outside north and latin america (a 12% increase on a constant currency basis). net revenue from masks and other accessories for the year ended june 30, 2015 totaled $703.0 million from $708.3 million for the year ended june 30, 2014, a decrease of 1%, including an increase of 1% in north and latin america and a decrease of 4% outside north and latin america (a 6% increase on a constant currency basis). excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, device sales for the year ended june 30, 2015 increased by 21%, and masks and accessories sales increased by 3%, compared to the year ended june 30, 2014.
the following table summarizes the percentage movements in our net revenue for the year ended june 30, 2015 compared to the year ended june 30, 2014:
north and         markets outside         total         markets outside               total latin america               north and                             north and           (constant latin america                         latin america          currency)*

gross profit.    gross profit increased for the year ended june 30, 2015 to $1,011.4 million from $989.8 million for the year ended june 30, 2014, an increase of $21.6 million or 2%. gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was 60.2% for the year ended june 30, 2015, compared with the 63.7% for the year ended june 30, 2014. the decline in gross margins was primarily due to declines in our average selling prices, an unfavorable product mix as sales of our lower margin products represented a higher proportion of our sales, an unfavorable impact from exchange rate movements as a result of the decline in the euro currency relative to u.s. dollar, and an unfavorable geographic mix.
selling, general and administrative expenses.    selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30, 2015 to $478.6 million from $450.4 million for the year ended june 30, 2014, an increase of $28.2 million or 5%. the selling, general and administrative expenses were favorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the u.s. dollar, which decreased our expenses by approximately $29.6 million, as reported in u.s. dollars. excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30, 2015 increased by 13% compared to the year ended june 30, 2014. as a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30, 2015 was 28.5%, compared to 29.0% for the year ended june 30, 2014.
the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional personnel to support our commercial activities, higher marketing expenditure associated with our recent product releases, an increase in our variable employee compensation costs, the impact of recent acquisitions, donations to the university of california  san diego and resmed foundation, and the release of contingent consideration in the prior year.
research and development expenses.    research and development expenses decreased for the year ended june 30, 2015 to $114.9 million from $118.2 million for the year ended june 30, 2014, a decrease of $3.4 million or 3%. the research and development expenses were favorably impacted by the depreciation of the australian dollar against the u.s. dollar, which decreased our expenses by approximately $11.0 million, as reported in u.s. dollars. excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, research and development expenses for the year ended june 30, 2015 increased by 6% compared to the year ended june 30, 2014. as a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 6.8% for the year ended june 30, 2015 compared to 7.6% for the year ended june 30, 2014.
the increase in research and development expenses in constant currency terms was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel and an increase in materials and tooling costs incurred to facilitate development of new products.
amortization of acquired intangible assets.    amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended june 30, 2015 totaled $8.7 million compared to $9.7 million for the year ended june 30, 2014. the reduction in amortization expense was mainly attributable to certain acquired intangibles reaching the end of their useful life and therefore being fully amortized.
total other income, net.    total other income, net for the year ended june 30, 2015 was $26.7 million, compared with $26.0 million for the year ended june 30, 2014. the increase in total other income, net, was due primarily due to gains on foreign currency transactions, partially offset by lower interest income resulting from lower interest rates on cash balances held and the depreciation of the australian dollar against the u.s. dollar.
income taxes.    our effective income tax rate was 19.0% for the year ended june 30, 2015 compared to 19.9% for the year ended june 30, 2014. our effective income tax rate is affected by the geographic mix of our taxable income, including lower taxes associated with our singapore and malaysia manufacturing operations. our singapore and malaysia operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs which will expire in whole or in part at various dates through june 30, 2020. as of june 30, 2015, we had not provided for u.s. income taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. we intend for these earnings to be permanently reinvested outside the united states.
net income and earnings per share.    as a result of the factors above, our net income for the year ended june 30, 2015 was $352.9 million compared to net income of $345.3 million for the year ended june 30, 2014, an increase of 2% over the year ended june 30, 2014. as a result of the increase in our net income and lower share count due to our stock repurchases, our earnings per share for the year ended june 30, 2015 was $2.47 per diluted share compared to $2.39 per diluted share for the year ended june 30, 2014, an increase of 3% over the year ended june 30, 2014.
liquidity and capital resources as of june 30, 2016 and june 30, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $731.4 million and $717.2 million, respectively. working capital was $0.8 billion and $1.1 billion, at june 30, 2016 and june 30, 2015, respectively. as of june 30, 2016 we had $1.2 billion of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan agreements.
as of june 30, 2016 and june 30, 2015, our cash and cash equivalent balances held within the united states amounted to $40.9 million and $32.0 million, respectively. our remaining cash and cash equivalent balances at june 30, 2016 and june 30, 2015, of $690.5 million and $685.2 million, respectively, were held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, indefinitely invested outside the united states. our cash and cash equivalent balances are held at highly rated financial institutions.
as of june 30, 2016, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries was approximately $1.2 billion, and those undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested. we intend to reinvest the cash and cash equivalents of those entities whose undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested in our international operations. we reassess our reinvestment intentions each reporting period and currently believe that we have sufficient sources of liquidity to support our assertion that the undistributed earnings held by foreign subsidiaries may be considered to be reinvested permanently. if these earnings had not been permanently reinvested, deferred taxes of approximately $286 million would have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements.
we repatriated $190 million and $130 million to the u.s. in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively, from earnings generated in each of those years. the amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated to the u.s. in the past has been determined, and the amount that we expect to repatriate during fiscal year 2017 will be determined, based on a variety of factors, including current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the u.s., such as for the repayment of debt, dividend distributions, and other domestic obligations. the majority of our repatriation of foreign subsidiaries earnings to the u.s. has historically occurred at year-end, although we may repatriate funds earlier in the year based on our business needs, as we did during the year ended june 30, 2016. when we repatriate funds to the u.s., we are required to pay taxes in the u.s. on these amounts based on applicable u.s. tax rates, net of any foreign tax that would be allowed to be deducted or taken as a credit against u.s. income tax. we paid $34.2 million and $17.1 million in additional u.s. federal income taxes in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively, as a result of repatriation of foreign earnings generated in those years.
inventories at june 30, 2016 decreased by $22.4 million or 9% to $224.5 million compared to june 30, 2015 inventories of $246.9 million. the decrease in inventories was due primarily to improved inventory management.
accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, at june 30, 2016 were $382.1 million, an increase of $19.5 million or 5% over the june 30, 2015 accounts receivable balance of $362.6 million. accounts receivable days sales outstanding of 63 days at june 30, 2016 decreased by 6 days compared to 69 days at june 30, 2015. our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total accounts receivable at june 30, 2016 and 2015 was 3.2% and 3.3%, respectively. the credit quality of our customers remains broadly consistent with our past experience.
during the year ended june 30, 2016, we generated cash of $547.9 million from operations. this was higher than the cash generated from operations for the year ended june 30, 2015 of $383.2 million, and was primarily due to a reduction in our inventories, an increase in our accounts payable and the impact from the adoption of asu 2016-09 improvements to employee share-based payment accounting, which included, among other things, a requirement to reclassify the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation arrangements from financing activities to operating activities. this reclassification increased the cash flow from operating activities for the year ended june 30, 2016, by $14.5 million. movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended june 30, 2016 had the effect of decreasing our cash and cash equivalents by $20.6 million, as reported in u.s. dollars. during fiscal years 2016 and 2015, we repurchased 1.9 million and 2.7 million shares at a cost of $102.1 million and $152.6 million, respectively. during fiscal years 2016 and 2015, we also paid dividends totaling $168.1 million and $157.3 million, respectively.

*these guarantees mainly relate to requirements under contractual obligations with insurance companies transacting with our german subsidiaries and guarantees provided under our facility leasing obligations.
credit facility on october 31, 2013, we entered into a revolving credit agreement, as borrower, with lenders, including union bank, n.a., as administrative agent, joint lead arranger, swing line lender and letters of credit issuer, and hsbc bank usa, national association, as syndication agent and joint lead arranger. the credit facility terminates on october 31, 2018, when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid. the outstanding principal amount due under the credit facility will bear interest at a rate equal to libor plus 1.0% to 2.0% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio). at june 30, 2016, the interest rate that was being charged on the outstanding principal amount was 2.0%. a commitment fee of 0.15% to 0.25% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio) applies on the unused portion of the credit facility. the credit facility also includes a $25 million sublimit for letters of credit.
in connection with the acquisition of brightree, we entered into an amendment to our existing revolving credit agreement, on april 4, 2016, to increase the size of the revolving credit facility from $700 million to $1 billion, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional $300 million and make other modifications to provide for the acquisition of brightree.
our obligations under the revolving credit agreement (as amended) are unsecured but are guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect u. s. subsidiaries, including resmed corp.; resmed motor technologies inc.; birdie inc.; inova labs, inc.; brightree llc; brightree services llc; brightree home health & hospice llc; and strategic ar llc, under an unconditional guaranty. the credit agreement contains customary covenants, including certain financial covenants and an obligation that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum leverage ratio of funded debt to ebitda (as defined in the credit agreement) and an interest coverage ratio.
part of the proceeds from the funding of the revolving credit facility were used to pay a portion of the acquisition consideration for the brightree acquisition, as well as to pay fees and expenses in connection with the acquisition, the amendment to the revolving credit agreement and the term loan credit agreement (as described below).
at june 30, 2016, we were in compliance with our debt covenants and there was $875.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
term loan on april 4, 2016, in connection with the brightree acquisition, we also entered into a credit agreement (the term loan credit agreement) providing a $300 million senior unsecured one-year term loan credit facility.
our obligations under the term loan credit agreement are unsecure but are guaranteed by certain of resmeds direct and indirect u.s. subsidiaries, including resmed corp., resmed motor
technologies inc., birdie inc., inova labs, inc., brightree, brightree services llc, brightree home health & hospice llc and strategic ar llc, under an unconditional guaranty. the term loan credit facility terminates on april 3, 2017, when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid. the outstanding principal amount due under the term loan credit facility will bear interest at a rate equal to libor plus 1.0% to 2.0% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio). at june 30, 2016, the interest rate that was being charged on the outstanding principal amount was 2.0%. the term loan credit agreement contains customary covenants, including certain financial covenants and an obligation that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum ratio of funded debt to ebitda (as defined in the term loan credit agreement) and an interest coverage ratio.

at june 30, 2016, we were in compliance with our debt covenants under and there was $300.0 million outstanding under the term loan credit agreement. we plan to refinance the facility prior to the maturity date of the term loan agreement, based on our funding needs at that time.
we expect to satisfy all of our liquidity requirements through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt facilities.
tax expense our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the jurisdictions where our income is recognized. to date, a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was 30% in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014. during fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, our consolidated effective tax rate has fluctuated between 19% and 20%. these and future effective tax rate fluctuations resulted from and depend on numerous factors including the amount of research and development expenditures for which an additional australian tax credit is available; the level of foreign earnings repatriated to the u.s.; the geographic mix of taxable income and other tax credits and benefits available to us under applicable tax laws, including the lower statutory tax rates and incentives associated with our singapore and malaysia manufacturing operations.
critical accounting principles and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those estimates related to allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory adjustments, warranty obligations, goodwill, impaired assets, intangible assets, income taxes, deferred tax valuation allowances and stock-based compensation costs.
we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis. the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
(1)    allowance for doubtful accounts. we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments, which
results in bad debt expense. we determine the adequacy of this allowance by periodically evaluating individual customer receivables, considering a customers financial condition, credit history and current economic conditions. if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
(2)    inventory adjustments. inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the first-in, first-out method. we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales. the likelihood of any material inventory write-downs depends on changes in competitive conditions, new product introductions by us or our competitors, or rapid changes in customer demand.
(3)    valuation of goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets. we make assumptions in establishing the carrying value, fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets. the criteria used for these evaluations include managements estimate of the assets continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset, as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives. if assets are considered to be impaired, we recognize as impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value. we base useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us. factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the assets ability to generate positive cash flow, loss of legal ownership or title to the asset, a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends, significant changes in our strategic business objectives, utilization of the asset, and a significant change in the economic and/or political conditions in certain countries.
we conducted our annual review for goodwill impairment during the final quarter of fiscal 2016 using a quantitative assessment. the results of our annual review indicated that no impaired goodwill exists as the fair value for each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
(4)    income tax. we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to audit based upon managements evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. if we determine that it is not more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made. alternatively, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, any previously provided valuation allowance is reversed. these changes to the valuation allowance and resulting increases or decreases in income tax expense may have a material effect on our operating results.
our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions subject to audit by various tax authorities. in addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. although currently immaterial, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. based on our regular assessment, we may adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
(5)    provision for warranty. we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. we determine the amount of this provision by using a financial model, which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products. we use this financial model to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision. although we engage in product improvement programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures. should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates, we would be required to revise our estimated warranty provision.
(6)    revenue recognition. we generally record revenue on product sales at the time of shipment, which is when title transfers to the customer. we initially defer service revenue received in advance from service contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the service contract. we initially defer revenue we receive in advance from rental unit contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the rental contract. otherwise, we recognize revenue from rental unit contracts ratably over the life of the rental contract. we include in revenue freight charges we bill to customers. we charge all freight-related expenses to cost of sales. taxes assessed by government authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions, such as sales and value added taxes, are excluded from revenue.
we do not normally offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products, other than returns for product defects or other warranty claims. we do not recognize revenues if we offer a right of return or variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities. however, as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders, one-time special pricing to support new product introductions, sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or price-breaks for regular order volumes. we record the costs of all such programs as an adjustment to revenue. our products are predominantly therapy-based equipment and require no installation. therefore, we have no significant installation obligations. for multiple-element arrangements, we allocate arrangement consideration to the deliverables by use of the relative selling price method. the selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence.
we also generate revenue from time-based licensing of our software and associated services. in most instances, revenue is generated under sales agreements with multiple elements comprising subscription fees and professional services, which typically have contract terms of one to three years. we evaluate each element in these multiple-element arrangements to determine whether they represent a separate unit of accounting and recognize each element as the services are performed.
(7)    stock-based compensation. we measure the compensation cost of all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant. we recognize that value as compensation expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. we estimate the fair value of employee stock options and purchase rights granted using a black-scholes valuation model. the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards, the expected dividend per share and the expected life of the awards. the risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon the u.s. treasury yield curve at the time of grant appropriate for the expected life of the awards. expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from tradeable options of our stock corresponding to the expected term of the options. we use a combination of the historic and
implied volatilities as the addition of the implied volatility is more representative of our future stock price trends. while there is a tradeable market of options on our common stock, less emphasis is placed on the implied volatility of these options due to the relative low volumes of these traded options and the difference in the terms compared to our employee options. in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we use historical rates by employee groups. the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. the aforementioned inputs entered into the black-scholes valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense we record to vary.
we estimate the fair value of restricted stock units based on the market value of the underlying shares as determined at the grant date less the fair value of dividends that holders are not entitled to, during the vesting period. we estimate the weighted average grant date fair value of performance restricted stock units, or prsus, which contain a market condition, using a monte-carlo simulation valuation model.

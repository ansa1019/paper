item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview this md&a should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
the company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.  the company uses its significant global asset base to originate and transport agricultural commodities, connecting to markets in 163 countries.  the company also processes corn, oilseeds, and wheat into products for food, animal feed, chemical and energy uses.  the company uses its global asset network, business acumen, and its relationships with suppliers and customers to efficiently connect the harvest to the home thereby generating returns for our shareholders, principally from margins earned on these activities.
the company's operations are organized, managed, and classified into four reportable business segments: agricultural services, corn processing, oilseeds processing, and wild flavors and specialty ingredients.  each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered.  the company's remaining operations are not reportable business segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as other. see note 17 of item 8 for more information about the company's business segments.
the company's recent significant portfolio actions and announcements include:
•   the purchase in february 2016 of a controlling stake in harvest innovations, an industry leader in minimally processed, expeller-pressed soy proteins, oils, and gluten-free ingredients;
•   the purchase in april 2016 of a 50% interest in cairo-based medsofts group, a consolidated joint venture that owns and manages merchandising and supply chain operations;
•   the acquisition in june 2016 of a casablanca, morocco-based corn wet mill that produces glucose and native starch;
•   the expansion in november 2016 of olenex, a 37.5% joint venture with wilmar, from a sales and marketing venture to a full function joint venture which owns and operates specialty oils and fats, palm refining, and tropical oils processing plants in europe;
•   the announcement in january 2017 of the sale of the company's crop risk services businesses to validus holdings, a global group of insurance and reinsurance companies, which is subject to regulatory approval and expected to close in the first half of 2017; and
•   the acquisition in february 2017 of crosswind industries, inc., an industry leader in the manufacture of contract and private label pet treats and foods, as well as specialty ingredients.
as part of the implementation of the company's strategic plan, the company continues to evaluate the capital intensity of its operations and portfolio, seeking ways to reduce and redeploy capital in its efforts to drive long-term returns.
operating performance indicators the company's agricultural services and oilseeds processing operations are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity-based agricultural raw materials. therefore, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold. thus, changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit.
the company's corn processing operations and wild flavors and specialty ingredients businesses also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials. however, in these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily equal changes in cost of products sold. thus, changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
the company has consolidated subsidiaries in 76 countries.  for the majority of the company's subsidiaries located outside the united states, the local currency is the functional currency. revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into u.s. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods. for the majority of the company's business activities in brazil, the functional currency is the u.s. dollar; however, certain transactions, including taxes, occur in local currency and require conversion to the functional currency. changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the euro, british pound, canadian dollar, and brazilian real, as compared to the u.s. dollar.
the company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings, segment operating profit, return on invested capital, ebitda, economic value added, manufacturing expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses. the company's financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand, general global economic conditions, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. due to these unpredictable factors, the company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forward-looking information contained within "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
as an agricultural commodity-based business, the company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the company's operating results. agricultural services was negatively impacted in the first half of the year by weak u.s. grain export competitiveness and decreased global merchandising opportunities. starting in the third quarter, export volumes and margins improved due to the u.s. harvest and weather conditions in south america. in corn processing, global demand for sweeteners and starches and u.s. exports, principally to mexico, continued to grow. in europe, raw material costs improved resulting in improved margins. corn-based ethanol remained a very competitive transportation fuel, and domestic blending was strong as u.s. gasoline demand was up compared to 2015. u.s. ethanol also continued to be the one of the cheapest oxygenates in the world, driving strong export volumes throughout 2016. industry production levels remained high during the year limiting margins. in oilseeds processing, global crushing operations achieved strong capacity utilization although margins were weaker mainly due to higher supply of soybean meal from argentina, and other protein meal substitutes. softseed margins improved due to better seed supply and oil demand. vegetable oils continued to maintain a steady demand from the food industry. additionally, vegetable oil sales volumes benefited from demand driven by the u.s. 2016 biodiesel blenders credit. the wild flavors and specialty ingredients business benefited from increased demand for flavor ingredients and flavor systems, specialty proteins, natural health and nutrition products, and polyols, but was adversely impacted by soft market conditions in non-flavor food ingredient markets and a strong u.s. dollar, as well as operational issues at the specialty commodities unit.
net earnings attributable to controlling interests decreased $0.6 billion to $1.3 billion. segment operating profit decreased $0.6 billion to $2.7 billion, primarily due to the prior year gain on sale of the global cocoa and chocolate businesses and lower earnings in the current year due to the sale of those businesses, weaker global crushing and origination margins, and lower international merchandising results, partially offset by better ethanol results. corporate results in the current year include a charge of $19 million from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves, compared to a credit of $2 million in the prior year and a decrease of approximately $70 million in the company's share of the results of compagnie industrielle et financiere des produits amylaces sa (luxembourg) (cip).
income taxes increased $96 million due to a higher effective tax rate partially offset by lower earnings before income taxes. the company's effective tax rate for 2016 increased to 29.3% compared to 19.2% for 2015 due primarily to low tax rates on significant gains related to portfolio actions in 2015, a $71 million prior year discrete tax benefit resulting mainly from the release of a $66 million valuation allowance compared to a $49 million discrete tax expense in the current year, and changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings (see note 13 in item 8 for more information).
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
analysis of statements of earnings processed volumes by product for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows (in metric tons):
(in thousands)          2016   2015                 change oilseeds         33,788            33,817        (29   )
the company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions. the overall decrease in corn relates to the disposal of the sugar ethanol operations in may 2016 partially offset by volumes from the acquisition of eaststarch c.v. in november 2015.
following the sale of the cocoa business in october 2015, the remaining results of cocoa and other were combined with the results of refining, packaging, biodiesel, and other within the oilseeds processing segment effective january 1, 2016. prior period results have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
revenues by segment for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
revenues and cost of products sold in a commodity merchandising and processing business are affected by the underlying commodity prices and volumes. in periods of significant changes in commodity prices, the underlying performance of the company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in oilseeds processing and agricultural services, generally have a relatively equal impact from commodity price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit.
revenues decreased $5.4 billion, or 8%, to $62.3 billion due to lower average sales prices ($3.5 billion), including $0.6 billion in foreign currency translation impacts, and lower overall sales volumes ($1.9 billion). the decrease in sales prices was due principally to lower underlying agricultural commodity prices, in particular prices of corn, soybeans, and soybean-related products. the decrease in sales volumes was due principally to the sale of the cocoa business and decreased sales volumes of ethanol and south american grain and oilseed origination. agricultural services revenues decreased 6% to $27.9 billion due to lower average sales prices ($2.5 billion) partially offset by higher sales volumes ($0.7 billion). corn processing revenues decreased 5% to $9.5 billion due to lower sales volumes ($0.5 billion) due principally to ethanol and the sale of the sugar ethanol business partially offset by sales volumes from the acquisition of eaststarch c.v. oilseeds processing revenues decreased 12% to $22.2 billion due to lower average sales prices ($0.8 billion) and lower sales volumes ($2.3 billion) principally due to south american grains and oilseeds and the sale of the cocoa business. wfsi revenues were flat due to lower average sales prices ($0.2 billion) which were offset by higher sales volumes ($0.2 billion).
cost of products sold decreased $5.0 billion to $58.7 billion due principally to lower average commodity costs, including $0.6 billion in foreign currency translation impacts, and lower manufacturing costs. included in cost of products sold is a charge of $19 million from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves compared to a credit of $2 million in the prior year. manufacturing expenses decreased $0.2 billion to $5.2 billion primarily due to the sale of the cocoa business, lower energy usage and prices, and decreased repairs and maintenance expenses.
gross profit decreased $0.3 billion, or 8%, to $3.7 billion. the decrease in gross profit consists principally of lower soy crush margins ($309 million), reduced merchandising results ($95 million) primarily due to agricultural services global trade execution and positioning losses, lower volumes and freight rates in barge operations ($24 million), the sale of the cocoa business in the prior period ($78 million), partially offset by contribution of the recent eaststarch c.v. acquisition ($85 million), and higher results in sweeteners and starches ($169 million). these factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 31. the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves had a $19 million negative impact on gross profit compared to a positive impact of $2 million in the prior year. the decrease in underlying commodity prices did not result in a significant decrease in margins or gross profit as lower underlying commodity prices had a relatively equal impact on revenues and cost of products sold.
selling, general, and administrative expenses of $2.0 billion were comparable to the prior year. decreased expenses related to the sale of the cocoa business and a u.s. retiree medical benefit plan curtailment gain were offset by legal settlements, costs, and legal fees, increased transaction fees due to increased trading volume from the brokerage business, and expenses for the recently consolidated eaststarch c.v.
asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs decreased $145 million to $55 million. prior year charges include long-lived asset impairments of $129 million related to certain oilseeds processing facilities, sugar ethanol facilities in brazil, a facility in the corn processing segment, and capitalized software costs and restructuring and exit costs of $71 million related principally to an international pension plan settlement, sugar ethanol facilities in brazil, and several individually insignificant restructuring and exit costs. current year charges include $11 million of software impairment in corporate, $6 million of other-than-temporary impairment charges on the company's investment in two available for sale equity securities in corporate, and $17 million and $21 million of individually insignificant fixed asset impairment and restructuring charges, respectively.
interest expense declined $15 million to $293 million primarily due to lower interest rates on long-term debt and the $8 million effect of the revaluation of the mandatorily redeemable 10% interest in harvest innovations.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased $98 million to $292 million primarily due to lower earnings from the company's investments in wilmar and cip and a decrease in equity earnings from eaststarch c.v. which is now fully consolidated following the acquisition of the remaining interest in november 2015, partially offset by increased earnings from other equity investees.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
other income - net decreased $203 million to $147 million. prior year income consisted primarily of gain on sales of $256 million related primarily to the sale of the cocoa, chocolate, and lactic businesses, a gain of $212 million on the revaluation of the company's previously held equity investments in north star shipping, minmetal, and eaststarch c.v. in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interests, and a gain of $62 million on the sale of a 50% interest in the barcarena export terminal facility in brazil to glencore plc, partially offset by a $189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of outstanding debt and loss provisions of $45 million related to sugar ethanol facilities in brazil. current year income includes $48 million of realized additional consideration related to the sale of the company's equity investment in gruma s.a.b. de c.v. in december 2012, a $59 million gain, including recovery of loss provisions, related to the sale of the company's brazilian sugar ethanol facilities, a $12 million gain related to the revaluation of the remaining interest to settlement value in conjunction with the acquisition of amazon flavors, and a $10 million loss on sale of other individually immaterial assets.
operating profit by segment and earnings before income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:

agricultural services operating profit decreased 16%. merchandising and handling operating results declined primarily due to compressed grain handling margins in the first half of 2016. international merchandising results were down driven by poor execution and low market volatility which limited forward merchandising opportunities. strong origination results in argentina and the addition of destination marketing in egypt through the company's medsofts joint venture were partially offset by the absence of a $27 million prior year gain on the revaluation of the company's previously held investments in north star shipping and minmetal in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interest. milling and other results increased 12%. current period results include additional realized consideration related to the sale of the company's equity investment in gruma s.a.b de c.v. in december 2012 of $48 million. transportation operating profit declined due to weak barge demand and lower freight rates.
corn processing operating profit increased 25%. sweeteners and starches operating profit increased as the business continued to perform well with higher volumes and pricing and improved margins from optimizing flex grind in the company's corn wet mills. the integration of the recent eaststarch c.v. and morocco acquisitions has progressed smoothly, significantly exceeding the company's earnings accretion target. bioproducts profit improved due to higher ethanol margins towards the end of the year, a $59 million gain, including recovery of loss provisions, related to the sale of the company's brazilian sugar ethanol facilities, and the absence of prior year's restructuring and fixed asset impairment charges of $75 million related to the sugar ethanol business.
oilseeds processing operating profit decreased 45%. crushing and origination operating profit declined driven primarily by lower global soy crush margins which were high last year, lower south american grain origination results caused by smaller soybean and corn crops in the region and year-over-year slower farmer-selling, absence of a $62 million prior year gain related to the sale of the 50% interest in the barcarena export terminal facility in brazil to glencore plc, partially offset by strong softseed volumes and margins in north america. refining, packaging, biodiesel, and other results declined due to the gain of $244 million on the sale of the global cocoa and chocolate businesses in october 2015 and lower earnings in the current year due to the sale of these businesses, partially offset by good demand and improved margins for refined and packaged oils and improved european biodiesel results. asia results declined due primarily to equity losses of $48 million from the company's investment in wilmar that was recorded in the company's results in the third quarter of 2016.
wild flavors and specialty ingredients (wfsi) operating profit increased 2% due to strong results in flavors and systems, polyols, and natural health and nutrition products and a gain of $12 million related to the acquisition of the remaining interest in amazon flavors. these increases were partially offset by weaker sales of hydrocolloids and fibers, a short edible beans crop impacting volumes and costs, and operational issues at the specialty commodities unit.
other - financial operating profit increased on higher volumes from the company's futures commission brokerage business and improved results from its captive insurance operations.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
corporate results were a net charge of $882 million in the current year compared to $988 million in the prior year. the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves resulted in a charge of $19 million in the current year compared to a credit of $2 million in the prior year. interest expense - net declined $15 million due principally to lower interest rates on long-term debt and the effect of the revaluation of the mandatorily redeemable 10% interest in harvest innovations. unallocated corporate costs increased $24 million due primarily to increased spending on the company's erp program and various strategic business improvement projects. other charges in the current year included legal settlement costs and legal fees, a software impairment charge, other-than-temporary impairment charges on the company's investments in two available for sale equity securities, a loss on the sale of an investment, other asset impairment and restructuring charges, partially offset by a gain related to a u.s. retiree medical benefit plan curtailment. other charges in the prior year consisted of the $189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of outstanding debt, restructuring charges of $29 million related principally to an international pension plan settlement, and asset impairment and settlement charges of $24 million. the increase in minority interest and other expense is due to a decrease of approximately $70 million in the company's share of the results of cip.
non-gaap financial measures the company uses adjusted earnings per share (eps) and adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization (ebitda), non-gaap financial measures as defined by the securities and exchange commission, to evaluate the company's financial performance. these performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, gaap financial measures.
adjusted eps is defined as diluted eps adjusted for the effects on reported diluted eps of certain specified items. adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for specified items. the company calculates adjusted ebitda by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes.
management believes that adjusted eps and adjusted ebitda are useful measures of the company's performance because they provide investors additional information about the company's operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. adjusted eps and adjusted ebitda are not intended to replace or be an alternative to diluted eps and earnings before income taxes, respectively, the most directly comparable amounts reported under gaap.

as an agricultural commodity-based business, the company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the company's operating results. agricultural services was negatively impacted by the ample global supply of agricultural commodities which limited merchandising opportunities, reduced demand for north american grain exports, and moderated commodity prices throughout the year 2015. the increase in global supply was due to several large harvests which built up world grain stocks to historically high levels. in addition, the u.s. dollar continued to be firm against weakening global currencies, particularly those in major crop growing countries such as brazil, argentina, and ukraine. this resulted in margin pressure and decreased north american export volumes most of 2015, partially offset by higher domestic grain demand. transportation was also impacted by the decreased north american export volumes as well as lower global freight rates. demand and prices for sweeteners and starches remained solid while co-product prices weakened. ethanol demand remained strong both in north america and export markets due to favorable gasoline blending economics and ethanol's continuing status as a competitive octane enhancer. despite strong demand, ethanol margins were weak due to record-high levels of u.s. industry production for most 2015, leading to excess inventory. overall demand for global protein meal and vegetable oil remained strong, especially in north america. south american oilseeds saw significantly higher volumes and margins for grain origination and exports due to the significant depreciation of the brazilian real against the u.s. dollar. lower softseed availability affected seed basis, resulting in lower softseed crushing volumes and weaker margins, particularly in europe. biodiesel demand resulting from international biofuel standards continued to support demand for crude and refined vegetable oil, although demand for biodiesel was softer throughout 2015 due to weaker economic conditions in certain countries. the wild flavors and specialty ingredients business continued to focus on cost synergies and new revenue opportunities amid economic uncertainty in many emerging economies and some softening in demand. customers' interest to develop innovative, healthy, and nutritious food products in response to macro trends in diet and demographics remained strong and continued to grow.
net earnings attributable to controlling interests decreased $0.4 billion to $1.8 billion. segment operating profit was down 16%, due primarily to weaker ethanol margins and lower volumes and margins of north american grain exports. corporate results in 2015 include a charge of $189 million related to the repurchase of outstanding debt, in addition to a credit of $2 million from the effect of decreasing agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves, compared to a lifo credit of $245 million in 2014.
income taxes decreased from $877 million to $438 million due to lower earnings before income taxes and a decreased effective tax rate. the company's effective tax rate for 2015 decreased to 19% compared to 28% for 2014 due primarily to low tax rates on significant one-time gains related to portfolio actions, a $70 million favorable impact of discrete items, mainly the release of a $66 million valuation allowance, and changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
analysis of statements of earnings processed volumes by product for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows (in metric tons):
(in thousands)          2015   2014                  change oilseeds         33,817            32,208       1,609
the company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to current and seasonal local supply and demand conditions. record volumes of oilseeds were processed during 2015, increased from 2014 as a result of the strong demand environment for soybean meal. processed volumes of corn decreased in response to high ethanol industry production which outpaced demand throughout the year 2015.
following the sale of the cocoa business in october 2015, the remaining results of cocoa and other were combined with the results of refining, packaging, biodiesel, and other within the oilseeds processing segment effective january 1, 2016. results prior to january 1, 2016 have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
revenues and cost of products sold in a commodity merchandising and processing business are affected by the underlying commodity prices and volumes. in periods of significant changes in commodity prices, the underlying performance of the company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in oilseeds processing and agricultural services, generally have a relatively equal impact from commodity price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit.
revenues decreased 17% due principally to lower sales prices ($12.9 billion) and lower sales volumes ($0.6 billion). sales prices decreased principally due to lower underlying agricultural commodity prices, in particular prices of soybeans, corn, and wheat, and $5.8 billion in foreign currency translation impacts due to the strength of the u.s. dollar. agricultural services revenues decreased 18% primarily due to lower sales prices ($5.3 billion) and lower sales volumes ($1.3 billion). corn processing revenues decreased 19% due principally to lower sales prices ($1.9 billion) and lower sales volumes ($0.4 billion). oilseeds processing revenues decreased 18% due principally to lower sales prices ($5.5 billion) and lower sales volumes ($0.2 billion). wild flavors and specialty ingredients revenues increased 76% due principally to higher sales volumes resulting from the inclusion of the full year results of wild flavors and sci, which were acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 ($1.2 billion), partially offset by lower prices ($0.2 billion).
cost of products sold decreased $12.8 billion to $63.7 billion due principally to lower average commodity prices, including $5.6 billion from foreign currency translation impacts due to the strength of the u.s. dollar, and lower manufacturing costs. included in cost of products sold is a credit of $2 million from the effect of decreasing agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves compared to a credit of $245 million in 2014. manufacturing expenses decreased $291 million to $5.5 billion primarily due to lower fuel prices, partially offset by increased employee benefit costs due to the inclusion of the full year costs for wild flavors and sci.
gross profit decreased $0.7 billion, or 16%, to $4.0 billion due principally to lower ethanol margins ($0.6 billion) and foreign currency translation impacts ($0.2 billion). the inclusion of the full year results of wild flavors and sci was partially offset by lower credit from the effect of decreasing agricultural commodity prices on lifo valuation reserves. these factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 38. the decrease in underlying commodity prices did not result in a significant decrease in margins or gross profit as lower underlying commodity prices had a relatively equal impact on revenues and cost of products sold.
asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs recognized in 2015 of $200 million consisted of long-lived asset impairments of $129 million related to certain oilseeds processing facilities, sugar ethanol facilities in brazil, a facility in the corn processing segment, and capitalized software costs and restructuring and exit costs of $71 million related principally to an international pension plan settlement, sugar ethanol facilities in brazil, and several individually insignificant restructuring and exit costs. asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs recognized in 2014 of $105 million consisted of costs associated with the relocation of the company's global headquarters to chicago, illinois of $16 million, restructuring charges related primarily to the wild flavors acquisition and to the integration of a subsidiary following the acquisition of the minority interest of $48 million, other-than-temporary investment writedown of $6 million, and several individually insignificant fixed asset impairments of $35 million.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $18 million to $390 million primarily due to higher earnings from the company's investment in cip.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
other income increased $77 million from $273 million to $350 million. other income in the year ended december 31, 2015 consisted primarily of gain on sales of $256 million related primarily to the sale of the cocoa, chocolate, and lactic businesses, a gain of $212 million on the revaluation of the company's previously held equity investments in north start shipping, minmetal, and eaststarch c.v. in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interests, and a gain of $62 million on the sale of a 50% interest in the barcarena export terminal facility in brazil to glencore plc, partially offset by a $189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of outstanding debt in 2015 and loss provisions of $45 million related to sugar ethanol facilities in brazil. other income in the year ended december 31, 2014 consisted primarily of gains of $156 million upon the company's effective dilution in the pacificor joint venture and $126 million on the sale of the fertilizer business, partially offset by losses of $102 million on euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the wild flavors acquisition.

agricultural services operating profit decreased 32%. merchandising and handling results decreased on fewer merchandising opportunities and lower margins due to ample global supplies of grain, reduced u.s. export competitiveness during the second half of 2015 due to the strong u.s. dollar, and a large south american harvest. also contributing to the decrease were the absence of a 2014 gain of $17 million related to a partial recovery of a loss provision and a 2014 gain of $156 million from the company's effective dilution in the pacificor joint venture, partially offset by a 2015 gain of $27 million on the revaluation of the company's previously held investments in north star shipping and minmetal in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interests. milling and other results improved due to higher product margins and strong merchandising results. transportation results declined due to lower freight rates and volumes driven by reduced u.s. export volumes in the second half of 2015.
corn processing operating profit decreased 44%. included in the 2015 operating profit is approximately $13 million of mark-to-market losses related to hedge timing effects compared to $25 million of gains in 2014. excluding these items, sweeteners and starches operating profit increased $213 million due principally to the $185 million gain from the revaluation of the company's previously held investment in eaststarch c.v. in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interest in november 2015. also contributing to the increase were lower raw material costs and good demand relative to supply of products. excluding hedge timing effects, bioproducts operating profit declined by $675 million primarily due to lower industry ethanol margins. strong industry production levels resulted in high industry inventory levels which kept industry margins considerably lower than 2014, despite increased domestic and export demand. also contributing to the decrease were restructuring and fixed asset impairment charges of $75 million and loss provisions of $45 million related to the sugar ethanol business in brazil.
oilseeds processing operating profit increased 9%. included in the 2015 operating profit is $45 million of mark-to-market gains related to cocoa hedge timing effects compared to $17 million of losses in 2014. crushing and origination operating profit includes a 2015 gain of $62 million related to the sale of assets to the new barcarena export terminal joint venture in brazil and a 2014 gain of $126 million related to the sale of the fertilizer business. excluding these gains, crushing and origination operating profit increased $38 million primarily due to strong north american & european soybean crushing volumes and margins through the first half of 2015, driven by strong demand and an ample global bean supply. starting in the third quarter and continuing in the fourth quarter of 2015, global soybean crush margins declined as the more competitive argentine meal was anticipated to enter the already well-supplied global markets due to changes in argentine policies. softseed margins and volumes were lower, particularly in europe, resulting from weaker global demand for vegetable oil. large south american corn and soybean harvests also helped support a significant improvement in south america origination results. refining, packaging, biodiesel, and other operating profit declined primarily due to lower south american and european results partially offset by improved margins in north american oil refining operations. excluding hedge timing effects, cocoa and other results increased $149 million. the 2015 gain of $244 million on the sale of the global cocoa and chocolate business was partially offset by lower earnings due to the sale of these businesses and lower cocoa press margins and peanut processing results. asia results declined due principally to long-lived asset and goodwill impairments partially offset by an increase from the company's share of its results from its equity investee, wilmar.
wild flavors and specialty ingredients operating profit increased due primarily to the acquisitions of wild flavors and sci during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. incremental earnings from these acquisitions were partially offset by lower overall results in the other specialty ingredients businesses due to weakness in many emerging economies and a strong u.s. dollar, which reduced volumes and margins across a number of product lines.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
corporate results were a net charge of $988 million in 2015 compared to $785 million in 2014. the effects of changing commodity prices on lifo inventory valuations resulted in a credit of $2 million in 2015 compared to a credit of $245 million in 2014. interest expense - net declined due principally to lower interest rates. unallocated corporate costs increased $19 million due primarily to increased pension expense resulting from the adoption of a new mortality assumption, increased spending on the company's erp program and various strategic business improvement projects, partially offset by lower employee compensation expense. other charges in 2015 consisted of a $189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of outstanding debt, restructuring charges of $29 million related principally to an international pension plan settlement, and asset impairment and settlement charges of $24 million. other charges in 2014 consisted of a $102 million loss on euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the wild flavors acquisition, costs associated with the relocation of the company's global headquarters to chicago, illinois of $16 million, restructuring charges related to the alfred c. toepfer international integration and other restructuring charges of $15 million, and pension settlement of $98 million. minority interest and other expense in 2014 consisted primarily of a $56 million loss related to the company's equity method investment in cip.
non-gaap financial measures the company uses adjusted earnings per share (eps) and adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization (ebitda), non-gaap financial measures as defined by the securities and exchange commission, to evaluate the company's financial performance. these performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, gaap financial measures.
adjusted eps is defined as diluted eps adjusted for the effects on reported diluted eps of certain specified items. adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for specified items. the company calculates adjusted ebitda by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes.
management believes that adjusted eps and adjusted ebitda are useful measures of the company's performance because they provide investors additional information about the company's operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. adjusted eps and adjusted ebitda are not intended to replace or be an alternative to diluted eps and earnings before income taxes, respectively, the most directly comparable amounts reported under gaap.

liquidity and capital resources a company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity-based business.  the company's strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops that it merchandises and processes, expanding the global reach of its core model, and expanding its value-added product portfolio. the company depends on access to credit markets, which can be impacted by its credit rating and factors outside of the company's control, to fund its working capital needs and capital expenditures. the primary source of funds to finance the company's operations, capital expenditures, and advancement of its growth strategy is cash generated by operations and lines of credit, including a commercial paper borrowing facility.  in addition, the company believes it has access to funds from public and private equity and debt capital markets in both u.s. and international markets.
cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion for 2016 compared to $2.5 billion in 2015. working capital changes decreased cash by $0.6 billion in the current year compared to providing cash of $0.2 billion in the prior year. trade receivables increased $0.2 billion due principally to lower receivables sold under the accounts receivable securitization programs. inventories increased approximately $0.7 billion at december 31, 2016 compared to december 31, 2015 due to higher inventory quantities and higher prices. the company made a $0.2 billion voluntary contribution to the u.s. pension plans in 2015 and 2016. cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion this year compared to $21 million last year. capital expenditures and net assets of businesses acquired were $1.0 billion this year compared to $1.6 billion last year. proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets were $0.2 billion this year compared to $1.8 billion last year. sales of marketable securities, net of purchases, were $0.3 billion this year compared to $35 million last year. investments in and advances to affiliates include additional investments in wilmar of $0.6 billion for the year compared to $0.1 billion last year. cash used in financing activities was $0.6 billion this year compared to $2.6 billion last year. long-term debt borrowings in the current year related to the $1.0 billion of new notes issued on august 11, 2016 compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year which related to the €1.1 billion ($1.2 billion) of notes issued on june 24, 2015. long-term debt payments in the prior year included the purchase of $935 million aggregate principal amount of certain of the company's outstanding debentures for $1.1 billion pursuant to the cash tender offers and debt redemption. treasury stock purchases were $1.0 billion in the current year compared to $2.0 billion in last year.
at december 31, 2016, the company had $0.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 1.6 to 1.  included in working capital is $5.8 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories.  at december 31, 2016, the company's capital resources included shareholders' equity of $17.2 billion and lines of credit totaling $6.9 billion, of which $5.8 billion was unused.  the company's ratio of long-term debt to total capital (the sum of long-term debt and shareholders' equity) was 27% at december 31, 2016 and 24% at december 31, 2015.  the company uses this ratio as a measure of the company's long-term indebtedness and an indicator of financial flexibility.  the company's ratio of net debt (the sum of short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt, and long-term debt less the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities) to capital (the sum of net debt and shareholders' equity) was 26% at december 31, 2016 and 20% at december 31, 2015.  of the company's total lines of credit, $4.0 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there was no commercial paper outstanding at december 31, 2016.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
as of december 31, 2016, the company had $0.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $0.3 billion of which is cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested. based on the company's historical ability to generate sufficient cash flows from its u.s. operations and unused and available u.s. credit capacity of $4.5 billion, the company has asserted that these funds are permanently reinvested outside the u.s.
the company has accounts receivable securitization programs ( the "programs") with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers. the programs provide the company with up to $1.5 billion in funding against accounts receivable transferred into the programs and expands the company's access to liquidity through efficient use of its balance sheet assets (see note 19 in item 8 for more information and disclosures on the programs). as of december 31, 2016, the company utilized $1.0 billion of its facility under the programs.
the company expects capital expenditures of $1.3 billion during 2017. in 2017, the company expects additional cash outlays of approximately $0.7 billion in dividends and $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion in share repurchases, subject to strategic capital requirements.
the company's credit facilities and certain debentures require the company to comply with specified financial and non-financial covenants including maintenance of minimum tangible net worth as well as limitations related to incurring liens, secured debt, and certain other financing arrangements.  the company was in compliance with these covenants as of december 31, 2016.
the three major credit rating agencies have maintained the company's credit ratings at solid investment grade levels with stable outlooks.
contractual obligations in the normal course of business, the company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the company to make payments in the future.  the following table sets forth the company's significant future obligations by time period.  purchases include commodity-based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk," energy-related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the company's normal business activities.  the following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $55 million as of december 31, 2016 as the company is unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlement.  where applicable, information included in the company's consolidated financial statements and notes is cross-referenced in this table.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
(1) includes pension contributions of $30 million for fiscal 2017.  the company is unable to estimate the amount of pension contributions beyond fiscal year 2017.  for more information concerning the company's pension and other postretirement plans, see note 15 in item 8.
at december 31, 2016, the company estimates it will spend approximately $1.5 billion through fiscal year 2021 to complete currently approved capital projects which are not included in the table above.
the company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $1.1 billion at december 31, 2016 which are not included in the table above.
the company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity-method investees, which could obligate the company to make future payments.  the company's liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation.  the company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations.
off balance sheet arrangements accounts receivable securitization programs since march 2012, the company has had an accounts receivable securitization program with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers. in march 2014, the company entered into a second accounts receivable securitization program with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers. see note 19 of item 8 for more information about these programs.
synthetic leasing program the company is a party to lease agreements under synthetic leasing programs for certain of its u.s. barge and trucking assets for periods ranging from 5 to 7 years. as of december 31, 2016, outstanding lease balances, including the value of the underlying assets of $170 million, were off-balance sheet. these agreements provide the company with the right to use these assets for specified periods in exchange for an obligation to make rental payments. the agreements are accounted for as operating leases, such that the rent expense is recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings. the future lease payments pertaining to these lease agreements are included in the contractual obligations table in item 7. these leasing programs are utilized primarily to diversify funding sources and to retain flexibility. the company recorded $5 million of rent expense pertaining to synthetic lease payments for each of the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.
critical accounting policies the process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the company's assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses.  these estimates and judgments are based on the company's historical experience and management's knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.  certain of the company's accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the company's financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management.  management has discussed with the company's audit committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies.  following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the company's financial statements.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
fair value measurements - inventories and commodity derivatives certain of the company's inventory and commodity derivative assets and liabilities as of december 31, 2016 are valued at estimated fair values, including $4.4 billion of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, $0.6 billion of derivative assets, $0.7 billion of derivative liabilities, and $0.5 billion of inventory-related payables.  commodity derivative assets and liabilities include forward fixed-price purchase and sale contracts for agricultural commodities. merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing.  management estimates fair value for its commodity-related assets and liabilities based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets.  the company's inventory and derivative commodity fair value measurements are mainly based on observable market quotations without significant adjustments and are therefore reported as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  level 3 fair value measurements of approximately $1.5 billion of assets and $0.2 billion of liabilities represent fair value estimates where unobservable price components represent 10% or more of the total fair value price.  for more information concerning amounts reported as level 3, see note 3 in item 8.  changes in the market values of these inventories and commodity contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  if management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.  additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.
derivatives - designated hedging activities the company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the company's anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol.  these designated hedging programs principally relate to the company's corn processing operating segment.  assuming normal market conditions, the change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.  gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized.  if it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts would be recorded immediately in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  see note 4 in item 8 for additional information.
investments in affiliates the company applies the equity method of accounting for investments over which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence.  these investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.  generally, the minimum ownership threshold for asserting significant influence is 20% ownership of the investee.  however, the company considers all relevant factors in determining its ability to assert significant influence including but not limited to, ownership percentage, board membership, customer and vendor relationships, and other arrangements.  if management used a different accounting method for these investments, then the amount of earnings from affiliates the company recognizes may materially differ.
income taxes the company accounts for its income tax positions in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. these standards prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements. the company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. the company frequently faces challenges from u.s. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.  these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.  in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the company.  for example, the company has received tax assessments from tax authorities in brazil and argentina, challenging income tax positions taken by subsidiaries of the company.  the company evaluated its tax positions for these matters and concluded, based in part upon advice from legal counsel, that it was appropriate to recognize the tax benefits of these positions (see note 13 in item 8 for additional information).
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns where the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the company's income statement.  the realization of the company's deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.  the company evaluates all available positive and negative evidence including estimated future reversals of existing temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial results. valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not likely. during 2016, the company decreased valuation allowances by approximately $86 million primarily related to the divestiture of an impaired entity. to the extent the company were to favorably resolve matters for which valuation allowances have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned valuation allowances, the company's effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted.
undistributed earnings of the company's foreign subsidiaries and the company's share of the undistributed earnings of affiliated corporate joint venture companies accounted for on the equity method amounting to approximately $9.3 billion at december 31, 2016, are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for u.s. income taxes has been provided thereon.  if the company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the company could be subject to u.s. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements.
property, plant, and equipment and asset abandonments and write-downs the company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.  this business is global in nature and is highly capital-intensive.  both the availability of the company's raw materials and the demand for the company's finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  these aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the company's raw materials and finished products.  any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the company's assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its facilities.  the company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value-added products produced from agricultural commodities and products.  these new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective.  management evaluates the company's property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.  assets are written down to fair value after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value.  if management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.  during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, impairment charges for property, plant, and equipment were $17 million, $108 million, and $35 million, respectively (see note 18 in item 8 for additional information).
business combinations the company's acquisitions are accounted for as purchases in accordance with asc topic 805, business combinations, as amended. assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on preliminary purchase price allocations, are adjusted to fair values at acquisition date with the remainder of the purchase price, if any, recorded as goodwill. when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows and discount rates. although management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, actual results may differ.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests.  the company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on october 1 or whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  critical estimates in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows and discount rates. definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 2 to 50 years and are reviewed for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  the company recorded an impairment charge for goodwill and intangibles of $11 million and $21 million during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively (see note 18 in item 8 for more information). there were no impairment charges recorded for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the year ended december 31, 2014. if management used different estimates and assumptions in its impairment tests, then the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
employee benefit plans the company provides substantially all u.s. employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with retirement benefits including defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans.  the company provides eligible u.s. employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are "grandfathered" into subsidized coverage while others are provided with health care reimbursement accounts).  in order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs.  these estimates and assumptions are based on the company's historical experience combined with management's knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.  management also uses third-party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans.  if management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations - fiscal year 2016 overview during fiscal 2016, demand for new homes continued to reflect the stable to moderately improved trends we have seen across most of our operating markets over the past year. we continue to see varying levels of strength in new home demand and home prices across our markets, with demand in each market generally reflecting the relative strength of each market's economy, as measured by job growth, household incomes, household formations and consumer confidence.
our position as the largest and most geographically diverse homebuilder in the united states provides a strong platform for us to compete for new home sales. in recent years, we have focused on expanding our product offerings to more consistently include a broad range of homes for entry-level, move-up and luxury buyers across most of our markets. our affordable entry-level homes have experienced very strong demand from homebuyers, as the entry-level segment of the new home market remains under-served, with low inventory levels relative to demand. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we began introducing affordable homes for the active adult buyer seeking a low-maintenance lifestyle in an age-restricted or age-targeted community. we plan to continue to expand our product offerings across more of our operating markets during fiscal 2017.
we believe our business is well positioned for the future because of our broad geographic operating base and product offerings, our inventory of finished lots, land and homes, our strong balance sheet and liquidity and our experienced personnel across our operating markets. we are focused on growing our profitability, generating positive annual cash flows from operations and managing our product offerings, pricing, sales pace, and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments.
we believe that housing demand in our individual operating markets is tied closely to each market's economy; therefore, we expect that housing market conditions will vary across our markets. if the u.s. economy continues to improve, we would expect to see slow to moderate growth in housing demand, concentrated in markets where job growth is occurring. the pace and sustainability of new home demand and our future results could be negatively affected by weakening economic conditions, decreases in the level of employment and housing demand, decreased home affordability, significant increases in mortgage interest rates or tightening of mortgage lending standards.
strategy our operating strategy is focused on leveraging our financial and competitive position to increase the returns on our inventory investments while generating strong profitability and cash flows. this strategy includes the following initiatives:
•   maintaining a strong cash balance and overall liquidity position and controlling our level of debt.
•   offering new home communities that appeal to a broad range of entry-level, move-up, active adult and luxury homebuyers based on consumer demand in each market.
•   modifying product offerings, sales pace, home prices and sales incentives as necessary in each of our markets to meet consumer demand, align with finished lot supply and construction activity and optimize returns on inventory investments and cash flows.
•   increasing the amount of land and finished lots controlled through option purchase contracts to mitigate the risk of land ownership.
•   investing in land and land development and pursuing opportunistic acquisitions of homebuilding companies in desirable markets, while controlling the level of land and lots we own in each of our markets relative to the local new home demand.
•   improving the efficiency of our land development, construction, sales and other key operational activities.
we expect our operating strategy will allow us to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position while continuing to increase our revenues and profitability. our operating strategy has produced positive results in recent years. however, we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful, and we may need to adjust components of our strategy to meet future market conditions.
•   homebuilding debt to total capital was 29.2%, improving from 36.1%.
•   total equity was $6.8 billion, compared to $5.9 billion.
(1)   net sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers (gross sales orders), net of cancelled sales orders.
the value of net sales orders increased 12% to $12.0 billion (40,814 homes) in 2016 from $10.7 billion (37,380 homes) in 2015, with increases in all of our regions. the increases in the value of sales orders were primarily due to increases in volume and to a lesser extent, increases in selling prices in most regions.
the number of net sales orders increased 9%, and the average price of net sales orders increased 2% to $294,000 during 2016 compared to 2015. our florida markets contributed most to the higher volume in our southeast region and our las vegas market contributed most to the higher volume in our west region. the volume increases in our other regions reflect continued stable to moderately improved market conditions in these markets. we believe our business is well positioned to continue to generate increased sales volume; however, our future sales volumes will depend on the economic strength of each of our operating markets and our ability to successfully implement our operating strategies in each market.
the value of net sales orders increased 29% to $10.7 billion (37,380 homes) in 2015 from $8.3 billion (29,709 homes) in 2014, with increases in all of our regions. the increases in sales order value were primarily due to increases in volume as we expanded our operations and increased our market share in many of our markets. to a lesser extent, an increase in selling prices in our south central region also contributed to the increase in sales order value.
the number of net sales orders increased 26%, and the average price of our net sales orders increased 3% to $287,300 during 2015 compared to 2014. the increases in our east and southeast regions reflect the positive impact of our may 2014 acquisition of the homebuilding operations of crown communities. crown communities added 527 net sales orders to the east region's results in 2015, compared to 236 net sales orders in 2014, and added 1,359 net sales orders to the southeast region's results in 2015, compared to 508 net sales orders in 2014.
revenues from home sales increased 13% to $11.8 billion (40,309 homes closed) in 2016 from $10.5 billion (36,648 homes closed) in 2015. the overall increase in home sales revenues reflects the continued stable to moderately improved market conditions in most of our markets.
the number of homes closed increased 28%, and the average selling price of those homes increased 5% to $285,700 during 2015 compared to 2014. the increases in our east and southeast regions reflect the positive impact of our may 2014 acquisition of the homebuilding operations of crown communities. crown communities added 585 closings to the east region's results in 2015, compared to 213 closings in 2014, and added 1,292 closings to the southeast region's results in 2015, compared to 508 closings in 2014. excluding the impact of crown communities, the increase in homes closed in our east region was primarily due to increases in our carolina markets, and in our southeast region was primarily due to increases in our florida markets. the increase in our midwest region was due to increases in our chicago and denver markets. in our south central region, the highest percentage increases in homes closed occurred in our houston, austin and fort worth markets. our phoenix market contributed the most to the increase in our southwest region. the increase in our west region was primarily due to increases in most of our california markets.
gross profit - home sales                              20.2     %         19.8     %         21.3     %
gross profit - land/lot sales and other                13.3     %          8.7     %         17.7     %
gross profit - total homebuilding                      19.9     %         19.2     %         20.2     %
home sales gross profit
gross profit from home sales increased 15% to $2.4 billion in 2016 from $2.1 billion in 2015 and increased 40 basis points to 20.2% as a percentage of home sales revenues. the 40 basis point increase in the home sales gross profit percentage resulted from improvements of 30 basis points due to the average selling price of our homes closed increasing by more than the average cost and 10 basis points due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of home sales revenues.
gross profit from home sales increased 25% to $2.1 billion in 2015 from $1.7 billion in 2014 and decreased 150 basis points to 19.8% as a percentage of home sales revenues. approximately 150 basis points of the decrease in the home sales gross profit percentage resulted from the average cost of our homes closed increasing by more than the average selling price. additionally, our home sales gross margin decreased approximately 20 basis points due to an increase in warranty and construction defect expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues. these decreases were partially offset by a 10 basis point improvement from a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of homes sales revenues and a 10 basis point improvement related to a decrease in the amount of purchase accounting adjustments for recent acquisitions.
our gross profit margins have remained relatively stable since fiscal 2015. based on current market conditions, we expect continued stability in our gross margins. we remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the returns on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions. these actions could cause our gross profit margins to fluctuate in future periods.
land sales and other revenues land sales and other revenues were $78.7 million, $89.6 million and $53.8 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we continually evaluate our land and lot supply, and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales can occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets. we generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them. however, some of the land that we purchase includes commercially zoned parcels that we may sell to commercial developers. we may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our supply or for other strategic reasons. as of september 30, 2016, we had $33.2 million of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months.
inventory and land option charges at the end of each quarter during fiscal 2016, we reviewed the performance and outlook for all of our land inventories and communities for indicators of potential impairment and performed detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary. as of september 30, 2016, we performed detailed impairment evaluations of communities and land inventories with a combined carrying value of $160.9 million and recorded impairment charges of $11.4 million during the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value of impaired communities and land to their estimated fair value. total impairment charges during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $20.3 million, $44.9 million and $75.2 million, respectively. impairments in fiscal 2016 and 2015 primarily related to strategic decisions to sell inactive parcels of land, most of which were in our east and southwest regions during fiscal 2016 and in our east, southeast and west regions during fiscal 2015. impairments in fiscal 2014 primarily related to underperforming projects in the chicago market of our midwest region and in the suburban washington, d.c. market of our east region.
as we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows, we may modify our pricing and incentives, construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities and land held for development, which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for potential impairment. also, if housing or economic conditions weaken in specific markets in which we operate, or if conditions weaken in the broader economy or homebuilding industry, we may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment. these evaluations could result in additional impairment charges.
during fiscal 2016, we wrote off $11.1 million of earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to land option contracts that we expect to terminate. earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs for fiscal 2015 and 2014 were $15.4 million and $10.0 million, respectively.
selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expense sg&a expense from homebuilding activities was $1.1 billion, $1.0 billion and $826.9 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, increasing 10% in 2016 and 21% in 2015 from the respective prior years. as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, sg&a expense decreased 20 basis points to 9.3% in 2016 and decreased 100 basis points to 9.5% in 2015 from the respective prior years. this improvement in sg&a expense as a percentage of revenues was achieved primarily through leverage of our fixed overhead costs resulting from the increase in homebuilding revenues.
employee compensation and related costs were $748.7 million, $679.4 million and $536.0 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. compensation costs represented 68% of sg&a costs in both fiscal 2016 and 2015 and 65% of sg&a costs in fiscal 2014. these costs increased 10% in 2016 and 27% in 2015 due to increases in the number of employees and equity and incentive compensation as compared to the respective prior years. our homebuilding operations employed 5,366, 4,888 and 4,525 employees at september 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
interest incurred we capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction (active inventory). capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer. interest incurred decreased 10% to $152.3 million in fiscal 2016 compared to 2015 due to a 9% decrease in our average debt. interest incurred decreased 9% to $169.2 million in fiscal 2015 compared to 2014, while our average debt increased 6%. the decrease in interest incurred in fiscal 2015 was due to a decrease in the average interest rate of our debt as compared to fiscal 2014. interest charged to cost of sales was 1.8%, 1.9% and 2.0% of total cost of sales (excluding inventory and land option charges) in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
other income other income, net of other expenses, included in our homebuilding operations was $12.7 million, $7.8 million and $5.5 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. other income in fiscal 2016 includes a $4.5 million gain from the sale of an investment in debt securities.
goodwill impairment we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation in the fourth quarters of fiscal 2016 and 2015. as a result of these evaluations, impairment charges of $7.2 million and $9.8 million were recorded in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, to reduce the goodwill in the huntsville operating segment in our southeast reporting region. this operating segment has experienced lower levels of profitability than anticipated primarily due to difficult market conditions. see note a.
business acquisitions in may 2014, we acquired the homebuilding operations of crown communities for $209.6 million in cash. crown communities operated in georgia, south carolina and eastern alabama. the assets acquired included approximately 640 homes in inventory, 2,350 lots and control of approximately 3,400 additional lots through option contracts. we also acquired a sales order backlog of 431 homes valued at $113.6 million.

(1)   expenses maintained at the corporate level consist primarily of interest and property taxes, which are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales or expensed directly, and the expenses related to operating our corporate office. the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes is allocated to each segment based on the segment's cost of sales, while expenses associated with the corporate office are allocated to each segment based on the segment's inventory balances.

inventories, land and lot position and homes in inventory we routinely enter into land/lot option contracts to purchase land or developed residential lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with planned development or anticipated new home demand. we also purchase undeveloped land that generally is vested with the rights to begin development or construction work, and we plan and coordinate the development of our land into residential lots for use in our homebuilding business. we manage our inventory of owned land and lots and homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets, including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold, completed homes in inventory.
(1)   corporate and unallocated inventory consists primarily of capitalized interest and property taxes.
our land and lot position and homes in inventory at september 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:
(2)   the total remaining purchase price of lots controlled through land and lot option purchase contracts at september 30, 2016 and 2015 was $3.6 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, secured by earnest money deposits of $167.0 million and $79.1 million, respectively. our lots controlled under land and lot option purchase contracts exclude approximately 700 and 1,300 lots at september 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing lots controlled under lot option contracts for which we do not expect to exercise our option to purchase the land or lots, but the underlying contracts have yet to be terminated. we have reserved the deposits related to these contracts.
results of operations - financial services and other the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services and other operations, comprising dhi mortgage, our subsidiary title companies and other businesses, for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014. as described in note a, the prior year amounts presented throughout this discussion reflect certain reclassifications made to conform to the classifications used in the current year.

(2)   excludes the effects of recourse expense or benefit on financial services revenues.
mortgage loan activity the volume of loans originated and brokered by our mortgage operations is related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations. in fiscal 2016, the volume of first-lien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased by 17%, corresponding to the 10% increase in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations combined with an increase in our mortgage capture rate (the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding operations for which dhi mortgage handled the homebuyers' financing). in fiscal 2015, the volume of first-lien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased by 32%, corresponding to the 28% increase in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations. our mortgage capture rate was 55%, 51% and 50% in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 93%, 89% and 88% of dhi mortgage loan originations in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. these rates reflect dhi mortgage's consistent focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations.
the number of loans sold increased 16% in fiscal 2016 and 30% in fiscal 2015 as compared to the respective prior years. virtually all of the mortgage loans originated during recent years and mortgage loans held for sale on september 30, 2016 were eligible for sale to fannie mae, freddie mac or ginnie mae. approximately 92% of the mortgage loans sold by dhi mortgage during fiscal 2016 were sold to four major financial entities, one of which purchased 27% of our total loans sold.
our mortgage operations revenues in fiscal 2016 were reduced by $8.5 million to increase our loss reserves for estimated future recourse obligations and other mortgage loans, and to adjust certain mortgage loans held for sale to fair value. our mortgage operations revenues in fiscal 2015 and 2014 were increased by $9.8 million and $2.2 million, respectively, from decreases to our loss reserves. our loss reserves for loan recourse obligations are estimated based upon analysis of the volume of mortgages originated, loan repurchase requests received, actual repurchases and losses through the disposition of such loans or requests and discussions with our mortgage purchasers. actual losses on mortgage loans may differ from our estimates, which may result in future changes to our loss reserves.
general and administrative (g&a) expense from financial services and other operations was $220.0 million, $183.0 million and $138.5 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, increasing 20% in 2016 and 32% in 2015 from the respective prior years. these increases were primarily due to increases in employee compensation costs to support the growth in our homebuilding closing volume. also, new federal regulations that have recently become effective required our mortgage operations to incur significant costs for additional personnel to implement and maintain compliance with these regulations. our financial services and other operations employed 1,610, 1,342 and 1,096 employees at september 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
as a percentage of financial services and other revenues (excluding the effects of recourse expense or benefit), g&a expense was 72.3%, 71.7% and 84.3% in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the improvement during fiscal 2016 and 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was due to the relative increase in revenue and leverage of fixed overhead costs. fluctuations in financial services g&a expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur, as some components of revenue may fluctuate differently than loan volumes, and some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned.
interest and other income, net of other expense, included in our financial services and other operations consists primarily of the interest income of our mortgage subsidiary. interest and other income in fiscal 2016 was lower than previous years due to expenses related to our other business activities, which include subsidiaries that conduct insurance-related operations, construct and own income-producing rental properties, own non-residential real estate including ranch land and improvements and own and operate oil and gas related assets.
results of operations - consolidated income before income taxes pre-tax income was $1.4 billion, $1.1 billion and $814.2 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increase in our operating income over the three-year period is primarily due to higher revenues and home sales gross profits from increased home closings.
income taxes our income tax expense was $467.2 million, $372.7 million and $280.7 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and our effective tax rate was 34.5%, 33.2% and 34.5%, respectively, in those years. the effective tax rate for all years includes an expense for state income taxes, reduced by tax benefits for the domestic production activities deduction and federal energy tax credits. the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 also includes a tax benefit for a reduction in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 includes a tax benefit for the reduction in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest.
at september 30, 2016 and 2015, we had deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of $486.6 million and $568.2 million, respectively, partially offset by valuation allowances of $10.3 million and $10.1 million, respectively. we had tax benefits of $40.1 million that exist for state net operating loss (nol) carryforwards that will expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction. of the total amount, $0.3 million of the tax benefits will expire from fiscal years 2017 to 2021, $12.9 million will expire from fiscal years 2022 to 2026 and $26.9 million will expire from fiscal years 2027 to 2036. we also had tax benefits for state tax credit carryforwards of $1.6 million that will expire from fiscal years 2018 to 2019 and $1.3 million of tax benefits for state tax credit carryforwards that have no expiration date. the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. also, changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets.
when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods. we record a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we reduced the valuation allowance by $17.5 million because we concluded it was more likely than not that we would realize more of our deferred tax assets related to state nol carryforwards than previously anticipated. we based this conclusion on additional positive evidence related to the actual taxable income achieved during fiscal 2015 and higher levels of forecasted profitability for future years. the remaining valuation allowance at september 30, 2015 related to our state deferred tax assets for nol carryforwards and certain tax credit carryforwards. the valuation allowance at september 30, 2016 relates to our state deferred tax assets for nol carryforwards only. we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of these state nol carryforwards will not be realized because some state nol carryforward periods are too brief to realize the related deferred tax assets. we will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining state nol carryforwards.
unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes. we had no unrecognized tax benefits and no accrued interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits at september 30, 2016 and 2015.
we are subject to federal income tax and to income tax in multiple states. the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2010 through 2016. we are currently being audited by various states.
capital resources and liquidity we have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services and other operations with cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities. our current levels of cash, borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to changes in homebuilding market conditions and allow us to increase our investments in homes, finished lots, land and land development to expand our operations and grow our profitability.
at september 30, 2016, our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital (homebuilding notes payable divided by total equity plus homebuilding notes payable) was 29.2%, compared to 36.1% at september 30, 2015. we intend to maintain our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital below 40% over the long term, but we may choose to operate at higher levels for short-term periods. therefore, future homebuilding debt to total capital ratios may be higher than the current level. we believe that the ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing our capital structure with other homebuilders. we exclude the debt of our financial services business because it is separately capitalized and its obligation under its repurchase facility is substantially collateralized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities.
we believe that our existing cash resources, our revolving credit facility and our mortgage repurchase facility provide sufficient liquidity to fund our near-term working capital needs and debt obligations, including the maturity of $350.0 million principal amount of senior notes during fiscal 2017. we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund future growth in our business, repay future debt obligations, and support other general corporate and operational needs, and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital. we have an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in august 2015, registering debt and equity securities which we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined. as market conditions permit, we may issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity.
capital resources - homebuilding cash and cash equivalents - at september 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents of our homebuilding segment totaled $1.3 billion.
bank credit facility - we have a $975 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $1.25 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. the facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to approximately 50% of the revolving credit commitment. letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the available borrowing capacity. the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be based on either the prime rate or london interbank offered rate (libor) plus an applicable margin, as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility. the maturity date of the facility is september 7, 2020. at september 30, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding and $93.5 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity of $881.5 million.
our revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations and activities, including requiring the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth, a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a borrowing base restriction if our ratio of debt to tangible net worth exceeds a certain level. these covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. a failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. in addition, the credit agreement governing the facility imposes restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. at september 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of our revolving credit facility.
secured letter of credit agreement - we have a secured letter of credit agreement which requires us to deposit cash, in an amount approximating the balance of letters of credit outstanding, as collateral with the issuing bank. the amount of cash restricted for letters of credit issued under this agreement totaled $2.9 million and $3.1 million at september 30, 2016 and september 30, 2015, respectively, and is included in homebuilding restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets.
public unsecured debt - on january 15, 2016, we repaid $170.2 million principal amount of our 5.625% senior notes, which were due on that date. on april 15, 2016, we repaid $372.7 million principal amount of our 6.5% senior notes, which were due on that date. we have $350.0 million principal amount of our senior notes maturing in may 2017. the indenture governing our senior notes imposes restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. at september 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the limitations and restrictions associated with our public debt obligations.
debt and equity repurchase authorizations - effective august 1, 2016, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of debt securities and $100 million of our common stock effective through july 31, 2017. the full amount of each of these authorizations was remaining at september 30, 2016.
capital resources - financial services and other cash and cash equivalents - at september 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents of our financial services and other operations totaled $31.4 million.
mortgage repurchase facility - our mortgage subsidiary, dhi mortgage, has a mortgage repurchase facility that is accounted for as a secured financing. the mortgage repurchase facility provides financing and liquidity to dhi mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which dhi mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties against the transfer of funds by the counterparties, thereby becoming purchased loans. dhi mortgage then has the right and obligation to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to third-party purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time frames from 45 to 60 days in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility. in february 2016, the mortgage repurchase facility was amended, and its maturity date was extended to february 24, 2017. additionally, new commitments were obtained from banks which increased the total capacity of the facility to $475 million and to $550 million during the last five days of any fiscal quarter and the first twenty-five days of the following fiscal quarter. in september 2016, the facility was amended to increase the capacity to $700 million from september 23, 2016 through november 21, 2016. the capacity of the facility can also be increased to $800 million subject to the availability of additional commitments.
as of september 30, 2016, $610.6 million of mortgage loans held for sale with a collateral value of $589.3 million were pledged under the mortgage repurchase facility. as a result of advance paydowns totaling $116.3 million, dhi mortgage had an obligation of $473.0 million outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility at september 30, 2016 at a 2.7% annual interest rate.
the mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by d.r. horton, inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt. the facility contains financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary's minimum required tangible net worth, its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its minimum required liquidity. these covenants are measured and reported to the lenders monthly. at september 30, 2016, dhi mortgage was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility.
in the past, our mortgage subsidiary has been able to renew or extend its mortgage credit facility at a sufficient capacity and on satisfactory terms prior to its maturity, and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments to the credit agreement during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale. the liquidity of our financial services business depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities.
operating cash flow activities in fiscal 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $618.0 million compared to $700.4 million in fiscal 2015. the most significant source of cash provided by operating activities in both years was net income.
investing cash flow activities in fiscal 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $112.6 million, compared to $95.4 million in fiscal 2015. in september 2016, we acquired the homebuilding operations of wilson parker homes for $91.9 million. we paid $82.2 million of the purchase price in cash during fiscal 2016 and expect the remaining purchase price to be paid in fiscal 2017. during fiscal 2015, we used cash to acquire the homebuilding operations of pacific ridge homes for $70.9 million.
we used $86.1 million and $56.1 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, to purchase property and equipment, including model home furniture, office and technology equipment and office buildings to support our operations. investing cash flows during fiscal 2016 include proceeds of $35.8 million from the sale of our investment in debt securities, which resulted in a $4.5 million gain. during fiscal 2015, we used $14.8 million of cash to increase our investment in the debt securities.
financing cash flow activities we expect the short-term financing needs of our operations will be funded with existing cash, cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities. long-term financing needs for the growth of our operations have historically been funded with the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets.
in fiscal 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $586.0 million, consisting primarily of note payments and payments of cash dividends. note repayments of $549.7 million included our repayment of $170.2 million principal amount of our 5.625% senior notes and $372.7 million principal amount of our 6.5% senior notes at maturity. during fiscal 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $117.0 million, consisting primarily of note proceeds, partially offset by repayments of notes payable and payments of cash dividends. proceeds from notes payable of $1.6 billion related to our issuance of $500 million principal amount of 4.0% senior notes in february 2015, draws of $975.0 million on our revolving credit facility and borrowings of $118.7 million under our mortgage repurchase facility. note repayments of $1.5 billion included our repayment of $1.3 billion drawn on our revolving credit facility and repayment of the $157.7 million principal amount of our 5.25% senior notes at maturity.
our board of directors approved and paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.08 per common share and $0.0625 per common share in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. in november 2016, our board of directors approved a cash dividend of $0.10 per common share, payable on december 12, 2016, to stockholders of record on november 28, 2016. the declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, financial condition and general business conditions.
contractual cash obligations, commercial commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements our primary contractual cash obligations are payments under our debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases. we expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our existing cash resources, cash flows generated from profits, our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities or other bank financing, and the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market conditions may permit.
(1)   homebuilding notes payable represent principal and interest payments due on our senior notes and our secured notes. because the balance of our revolving credit facility was zero at september 30, 2016, we did not assume any principal or interest payments related to this facility in future periods.
(2)   purchase obligations relate to our land and lot option purchase contracts which enable us to control significant lot positions with limited capital investment. among our land and lot option purchase contracts at september 30, 2016, there were a limited number of contracts, representing $38.1 million of remaining purchase price, subject to specific performance provisions which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their contractual obligations. further information about our land option contracts is provided in the "inventories, land and lot position and homes in inventory" section included herein.
(3)   financial services notes payable represent principal and interest payments due on our mortgage subsidiary's repurchase facility. the interest obligation associated with this variable rate facility is based on its annual effective rate of 2.7% and principal balance outstanding at september 30, 2016.
at september 30, 2016, our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of $96.4 million and surety bonds of $1.1 billion, issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts. we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. when we complete our performance obligations, the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter, leaving us with no continuing obligations. we have no material third-party guarantees.
our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations. further discussion of these commitments is provided in item 7a "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" under part ii of this annual report on form 10-k.
seasonality although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future, we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. the seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in both our homebuilding and financial services operations. as a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year.
inflation we may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation, primarily because of higher financing, land, labor and material construction costs. we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. however, during periods when housing market conditions are challenging, we may not be able to offset cost increases with higher selling prices. in addition, higher mortgage interest rates reduce the affordability of our homes to prospective homebuyers.

critical accounting policies general - a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of d.r. horton, inc. and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30, 2016 and 2015, and for the years ended september 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014. each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap, we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business, the results of our operations and our financial condition, and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements. the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected.
revenue recognition - we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. in situations where the buyer's financing is originated by dhi mortgage, our 100% owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment, the profit is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third-party purchaser has been completed. any profit on land sales is deferred until the full accrual method criteria are met. when appropriate, revenue and profit on long-term construction projects are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method.
we include proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies in homebuilding cash. when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers, or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes, we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are cancelled. we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on cancelled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.
we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed. we transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to third-party insurers. we typically elect the fair value option for our mortgage loan originations. mortgage loans held for sale are initially recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and are adjusted for subsequent changes in fair value until the loans are sold. net origination costs and fees associated with mortgage loans are recognized at the time of origination. the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment. we generally sell the mortgages we originate and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers. interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold.
some mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions, which can result in repurchases of loans previously sold to investors or payments to reimburse investors for loan losses. based on historical experience, discussions with our mortgage purchasers, analysis of the mortgages we originated and current housing and credit market conditions, we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale, as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests.
inventories and cost of sales - inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land development and home construction, capitalized interest, real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction. costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance, and cleaning, are charged to sg&a expense as incurred. all indirect overhead costs, such as compensation of sales personnel, division and region management, and the costs of advertising and builder's risk insurance are charged to sg&a expense as incurred.
land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins. home construction costs are specifically identified and recorded to individual homes. cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community. any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a community are generally allocated on a pro-rata basis to the remaining homes in the community associated with the relevant development activity.
when a home is closed, we generally have not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home. we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount estimated to ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed. we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home. we monitor the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amounts previously accrued. although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals, such differences have not been significant.
each quarter, we review our communities and land inventory for indicators of potential impairment. we generally review our inventory for impairment indicators at the community level, and the inventory within each community is categorized as land held for development, residential land and lots developed and under development, land held for sale and construction in progress and finished homes, based on the stage of production or plans for future development or sale. a particular community often includes inventory in more than one category. in certain situations, inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type or future plans. in reviewing each of our communities, we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the following:
•   projected gross margins based on community budgets;
•   performance of other communities in nearby locations.
if indicators of impairment are present for a community, we perform an impairment evaluation of the community, which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. if so, impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts. these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development, materials and labor costs which, in turn, may be impacted by the following local market conditions:
•   supply and availability of new and existing homes;
•   location and desirability of our communities;
•   pricing and use of incentives by us and our competitors;
•   alternative uses for our land or communities such as the sale of land, finished lots or home sites to third parties;
for those assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. when an impairment charge for a community is determined, the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot. impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes.
for the inventory impairment analyses performed during fiscal 2016, we assumed that for the majority of communities, sales prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each community, or in comparable communities, in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate. the remaining lives of the communities evaluated were estimated to be in a range from seven months to three years, and we utilized a range of discount rates for communities from 10% to 14%.
we rarely purchase land for resale. however, when we own land or communities under development that do not fit into our development and construction plans, and we determine that we will sell the asset, the project is accounted for as land held for sale if certain criteria are met. we record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell. in performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale, we consider several factors including, but not limited to, recent offers received to purchase the property, prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions and market analysis studies, which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land. if the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.
the key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market and economic conditions, and are inherently uncertain. although our quarterly assessments reflect management's best estimates, due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could differ from such estimates.
business acquisitions - we account for acquisitions of businesses by allocating the purchase price of the business to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values. any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired, particularly intangible assets. these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies. while we believe the estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
goodwill - we record goodwill associated with our acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price of the business exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. we evaluate our goodwill balances for potential impairment on at least an annual basis by comparing the carrying value of each of our operating segments with goodwill to their estimated fair values. the estimated fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows of the operating segment to their present value. if the carrying value of the operating segment exceeds its fair value, we determine if an impairment exists based on the implied fair value of the operating segment's goodwill. as a result of the goodwill evaluations performed in fiscal 2016 and 2015, impairment charges of $7.2 million and $9.8 million were recorded to reduce the goodwill in the huntsville operating segment in the southeast reporting region. this operating segment has experienced lower levels of profitability than anticipated primarily due to difficult market conditions. at september 30, 2016, there was no goodwill remaining in the huntsville operating segment. at september 30, 2016 and 2015, our goodwill balance was $80.0 million and $87.2 million, respectively.
warranty claims - we typically provide our homebuyers with a ten-year limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems, a two-year limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a one-year limited warranty on other construction components. since we subcontract our construction work to subcontractors who typically provide us with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work, claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors. warranty liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered. the amounts charged are based on management's estimate of expected warranty-related costs under all unexpired warranty obligation periods. our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate, and is adjusted to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them. actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts. a 10% change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual.
our reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims. as of september 30, 2016 and 2015, we had reserves for approximately 140 and 185 pending construction defect claims, respectively, and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements. during fiscal 2016, we established reserves for approximately 90 new construction defect claims and resolved 135 construction defect claims for a total cost of $44.0 million. we have closed a significant number of homes during recent years, and we may be subject to future construction defect claims on these homes. although regulations vary from state to state, construction defect issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which we operate. historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where we operate are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and anticipated future claims. these estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change. adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs.
historical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent, and we believe they may continue to fluctuate. housing market conditions have been volatile across most of our markets over the past ten years, and we believe such conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims. we closed a significant number of homes over the past ten years. if the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from our home closings in prior years varies from current expectations, it could significantly change our estimates regarding the frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims, which would impact the construction defect reserves in the future. if the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly exceed our current estimates, they will have a significant negative impact on our future earnings and liquidity.
we estimate and record receivables under the applicable insurance policies related to our estimated contingencies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable. additionally, we may have the ability to recover a portion of our losses from our subcontractors and their insurance carriers when we have been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies.
the estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products built, claim frequency, claim settlement costs and patterns, insurance industry practices and legal interpretations, among others. due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these contingencies, actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated amounts. a 10% increase in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim used to estimate the reserves would result in an increase of approximately $65.7 million in our reserves and a $34.8 million increase in our receivable, resulting in additional expense of $30.9 million. a 10% decrease in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately $59.2 million in our reserves and a $25.9 million decrease in our receivable, resulting in a reduction in expense of $33.3 million.
income taxes - we calculate our income tax expense (benefit) using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and attributable to net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods and in the jurisdictions in which those temporary differences become deductible. we record a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. also, changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets.
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense. significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change.
stock-based compensation - our stockholders formally authorize shares of our common stock to be available for future grants of stock-based compensation awards. from time to time, the compensation committee of our board of directors authorizes the grant of stock-based compensation to our employees and directors from these available shares. at september 30, 2016, our outstanding stock-based compensation awards include stock options and restricted stock units. grants of restricted stock units may vest immediately or over a certain number of years as determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors. restricted stock units outstanding at september 30, 2016 have a remaining vesting period of 1 to 5 years. stock options are granted at exercise prices which equal the market value of our common stock at the date of the grant. the stock options outstanding at september 30, 2016 vest over periods of 2 to 9.75 years from the initial grant date and expire 10 years after the dates on which they were granted.
the compensation expense for stock-based awards is based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period. the fair values of restricted stock units are based on our stock price at the date of grant. the fair values of stock options granted are calculated on the date of grant using a black-scholes option pricing model. determining the fair value of stock options requires judgment in developing assumptions and involves a number of estimates. these estimates include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior. in addition, we also use judgment in estimating the number of stock options that are expected to be forfeited. the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense are reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing cash flow.
fair value measurements - the fasb's authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-level hierarchy based upon the inputs to the valuation model of an asset or liability. the fair value hierarchy and its application to our assets and liabilities, is as follows:
•   level 1 - valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
•   level 2 - valuation is determined from quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or by model-based techniques in which all significant inputs are observable in the market.
•   level 3 - valuation is typically derived from model-based techniques in which at least one significant input is unobservable and based on our own estimates about the assumptions that market participants would use to value the asset or liability.
when available, we use quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value. we consider the principal market and nonperformance risk associated with our counterparties when determining the fair value measurements, if applicable. fair value measurements are used for our mortgage loans held for sale, debt securities collateralized by residential real estate, interest rate lock commitments (irlcs) and other derivative instruments on a recurring basis and are used for inventories, certain other mortgage loans, rental properties and real estate owned on a nonrecurring basis, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers," which is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance. the core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1, 2018 and allows for full retrospective or modified retrospective methods of adoption. we are continuing to evaluate the effect of adopting asu 2014-09 and the manner in which we will adopt the new standard.
in august 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-15, "presentation of financial statements - going concern," which provides guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. this guidance is intended to reduce the diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. the guidance is effective for us in our fiscal year ending september 30, 2017 and is not expected to have any impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
in february 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-02, "consolidation," which changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1, 2016 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
in july 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-11, "simplifying the measurement of inventory," which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory, excluding inventory measured using the last-in, first-out or retail inventory methods. the guidance specifies that inventory currently measured at the lower of cost or market, where market could be determined with different methods, should now be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1, 2017 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
in september 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-16, "business combinations: simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments," which requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1, 2016 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, "leases," which requires that lease assets and liabilities be recognized on the balance sheet, and that key information about leasing arrangements be disclosed. the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1, 2019, although early adoption is permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
in march 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-09, "compensation - stock compensation," which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1, 2017 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
in august 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-15, "statement of cash flows - classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments," which amends and clarifies the current guidance to reduce diversity in practice of the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1, 2018 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

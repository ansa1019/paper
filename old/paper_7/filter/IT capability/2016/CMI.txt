item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations organization of information the following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our business through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements. our md&a is presented in the following sections:
•   liquidity and capital resources
•   contractual obligations and other commercial commitments
•   application of critical accounting estimates
•   recently issued accounting pronouncements executive summary and financial highlights we are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related component products, including filtration, aftertreatment, turbochargers, fuel systems, controls systems, air handling systems and electric power generation systems. we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (oems), distributors and other customers worldwide. we have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, including paccar inc, daimler trucks north america, navistar international corporation and fiat chrysler automobiles. we serve our customers through a network of approximately 600 wholly-owned and independent distributor locations and over 7,400 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories.
our reportable operating segments consist of engine, distribution, components and power systems. this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves. the engine segment produces engines (15 liters and less in size) and associated parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various off-highway markets. our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as in various industrial applications, including construction, agriculture, power generation systems and other off-highway applications. the distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world. the components segment sells filtration products, aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. the power systems segment is an integrated power provider, which designs, manufactures and sells engines (16 liters and larger) for industrial applications (including mining, oil and gas and marine), standby and prime power generator sets, alternators and other power components.
our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction and general industrial markets. demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions. our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels, production schedules and stoppages. economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reduced sales of our products and can result in price reductions in certain products and/or markets. as a worldwide business, our operations are also affected by currency, political, economic and regulatory matters, including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards, in the countries we serve. as part of our growth strategy, we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as china, brazil, india, mexico, russia and countries in the middle east and africa. at the same time, our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results.
primarily due to decreased demand in the north american on-highway markets, lower organic sales in our distribution markets and unfavorable demand in the industrial oil and gas and construction markets, partially offset by increased distribution segment sales related to the consolidation of north american distributors and an increase in light-duty automotive sales primarily due to new sales for the nissan pick-up platform launched in the second half of 2015. continued global economic weakness in 2016 negatively impacted our international revenues (excludes the u.s. and canada), which declined by 2 percent, with sales down in most of our markets, especially in south america, the middle east, u.k., singapore and mexico. the decline in international sales was primarily due to declines in most international power generation markets, unfavorable foreign currency impacts of 4 percent of international sales (primarily in the british pound, chinese renminbi, indian rupee, brazilian real, south african rand and australian dollar), decreased demand in high-horsepower industrial markets led by declines in marine and mining, lower demand in distribution markets in asia pacific, africa and the middle east and lower demand in the on-highway markets in brazil and mexico.
the following table contains sales and earnings before interest expense, income tax expense and noncontrolling interests (ebit) results by operating segment for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015. see the section titled "operating segment results" for a more detailed discussion of net sales and ebit by operating segment including the reconciliation of segment ebit to consolidated net income.

(1) sales and ebit numbers were adjusted for the segment reorganization. see note 21, "operating segments," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
(2) the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, included $138 million and $60 million for loss contingency charges, respectively. see the "results of operations" section for additional information.
(3) the year ended december 31, 2015, included an impairment of light-duty diesel assets for the engine and components segments of $202 million and $9 million, respectively. see the "results of operations" section for additional information.
(4) the year ended december 31, 2015, included $90 million of restructuring actions and other charges which were re-allocated in conjunction with our segment realignment. restructuring actions and other charges for the engine, distribution, components, power systems and non-segment segments were $17 million, $23 million, $13 million, $26 million and $11 million, respectively. see the "results of operations" section for additional information.
net income attributable to cummins inc. for 2016 was $1.39 billion, or $8.23 per diluted share, on sales of $17.5 billion, compared to 2015 net income attributable to cummins inc. of $1.40 billion, or $7.84 per diluted share, on sales of $19.1 billion. net income was relatively flat as significantly lower gross margin and higher loss contingency charges were mostly offset by the absence of 2015 impairment and restructuring charges, in addition to lower research, development and engineering expenses, a lower effective tax rate, lower selling, general and administrative expenses and favorable changes to corporate owned life insurance. the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower volumes, unfavorable mix and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (primarily in the brazilian real, south african rand and canadian dollar), partially offset by lower material and commodity costs, improved distribution segment margins related to the acquisition of north american distributors since december 31, 2014 and lower warranty expense. diluted earnings per share for 2016 benefited $0.26 per share from lower shares outstanding, primarily due to purchases under the stock repurchase program.
we generated $1,935 million of operating cash flows in 2016, compared to $2,059 million in 2015. see the section titled "cash flows" in the "liquidity and capital resources" section for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.
in december 2016, our board of directors authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of additional common stock upon completion of the 2015 repurchase plan. during 2016, we repurchased $778 million, or 7.3 million shares of common stock. in 2016, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a third party financial institution to repurchase $500 million of our common stock under our previously announced share repurchase plans and received 4.7 million shares at an average purchase price of $105.50 per share. see note 13, "shareholders' equity," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
during 2016, we paid $109 million to acquire the remaining interest in the last two partially owned north american distributors, including the related debt retirements, and recognized a total gain of $15 million on the fair value adjustment resulting from the acquisition of the controlling interest in the previously unconsolidated entity. see note 18, "acquisitions," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
our debt to capital ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) at december 31, 2016, was 20.6 percent, compared to 17.5 percent at december 31, 2015. the increase was due to higher total debt, as a result of the commercial paper program added in 2016, and a net decrease in shareholders' equity. at december 31, 2016, we had $1.4 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand and access to our credit facilities, if necessary, to meet currently anticipated investment and funding needs. as of the date of filing this annual report on form 10-k, our credit ratings were as follows:

our global pension plans, including our unfunded and non-qualified plans, were 110 percent funded at december 31, 2016. our u.s. qualified plans, which represent approximately 56 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, were 118 percent funded and our u.k. plans were 121 percent funded. we expect to contribute approximately $134 million to our global pension plans in 2017. see application of critical accounting estimates within md&a and note 8, "pension and other postretirement benefits," to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information concerning our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.
in 2016, we recorded additional charges of $138 million for an existing loss contingency. see note 12, "commitments and contingencies," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
2017 outlook our outlook reflects the following positive trends and challenges to our business that we expect could impact our revenue and earnings potential in 2017:
•   weak economic conditions in brazil may continue to negatively impact demand across our businesses.
•   foreign currency volatility could continue to put pressure on our results.
demand in a number of important markets has been weak or declining for a number of years, below replacement levels, and we expect that demand will improve over time, as in prior economic cycles. we are well-positioned to benefit when market conditions improve.

•   power systems segment sales decreased 14 percent primarily due to lower demand in all product lines and decreased sales in most regions with the largest declines in north america, asia, china, latin america, the middle east, africa and western europe.
•   foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales by approximately 2 percent primarily in the british pound, chinese renminbi, indian rupee, brazilian real, south african rand, canadian dollar and australian dollar.
sales to international markets (excluding the u.s. and canada), based on location of customers, were 42 percent of total net sales in 2016, compared with 39 percent of total net sales in 2015.
gross margin gross margin decreased $495 million and 0.5 points as a percentage of sales, primarily due to lower volumes, unfavorable mix and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (primarily in the brazilian real, south african rand and canadian dollar), partially offset by lower material and commodity costs, improved distribution segment margins related to the acquisition of north american distributors since december 31, 2014 and lower warranty expense.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $46 million, primarily due to lower compensation expenses of $56 million as a result of restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015. compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. overall, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 11.7 percent in 2016 from 10.9 percent in 2015.
research, development and engineering expenses research, development and engineering expenses decreased $99 million, primarily due to reduced project spending in most of our segments, decreased compensation expenses as a result of restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015, and lower consulting expenses. overall, research, development and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 3.6 percent in 2016 from 3.8 percent in 2015. research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance.
equity, royalty and interest income from investees equity, royalty and interest income from investees decreased $14 million, primarily due to the consolidation of partially-owned north american distributors of $12 million and lower earnings at beijing foton cummins engine co., ltd. of $10 million, partially offset by higher earnings at other joint ventures.
loss contingency charges in 2016, we recorded charges of $138 million in addition to the 2015 charge of $60 million for a loss contingency. see note 12, "commitments and contingencies," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
impairment of light-duty diesel assets in 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $211 million on our light-duty assets. see note 19, "impairment of light-duty diesel assets," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
restructuring actions and other charges in 2015, we incurred a charge of $90 million which included $86 million for the severance costs related to both voluntary and involuntary terminations and $4 million for asset impairments and other charges. see note 20, "restructuring actions and other charges," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

(1) see note 18, "acquisitions," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
income tax expense our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent u.s. statutory income tax rate, primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. our effective tax rate for 2016 was 24.6 percent compared to 27.4 percent for 2015. the 2.8 percent decrease in our effective tax rate from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to favorable changes in the jurisdictional mix of pre-tax income.
we expect our 2017 effective tax rate to be 26 percent, excluding any discrete items that may arise.
noncontrolling interests noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to non-cummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities. noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased $9 million primarily due to lower earnings as a result of the consolidation of north american distributors since december 31, 2014 and lower earnings at cummins india ltd.
net income was relatively flat as significantly lower gross margin and higher loss contingency charges were mostly offset by the absence of 2015 impairment and restructuring charges, in addition to lower research, development and engineering expenses, a lower effective tax rate, lower selling, general and administrative expenses and favorable changes to corporate owned life insurance. diluted earnings per share for 2016 benefited $0.26 per share from lower shares outstanding, primarily due to purchases under the stock repurchase program.
•   foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales approximately 4 percent (primarily in the euro, brazilian real, australian dollar, canadian dollar, british pound and indian rupee).
•   distribution segment sales increased 20 percent, principally related to the acquisitions of north american distributors since december 31, 2013.
sales to international markets (excluding the u.s. and canada), based on location of customers, were 39 percent of total net sales in 2015, compared with 44 percent of total net sales in 2014.
gross margin gross margin increased $86 million and 0.6 points as a percentage of sales, primarily due to improved distribution segment sales from the consolidation of partially-owned north american distributors since december 31, 2013 and lower material and commodity costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (primarily in the australian dollar, canadian dollar, brazilian real and euro), unfavorable pricing, unfavorable mix and lower volumes.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $3 million, primarily due to lower consulting expenses of $41 million, partially offset by higher compensation and related expenses of $19 million (largely due to the acquisition of partially-owned north american distributors since december 31, 2013). compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. overall, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, was 10.9 percent in 2015 and 2014.
research, development and engineering expenses research, development and engineering expenses decreased $19 million, primarily due to higher expense recovery of $12 million, partially offset by higher consulting expenses of $8 million. overall, research, development and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 3.8 percent in 2015 from 3.9 percent in 2014. research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance.
equity, royalty and interest income from investees equity, royalty and interest income from investees decreased $55 million, primarily due to the consolidation of partially-owned north american distributors since december 31, 2013, of $74 million, lower earnings at dongfeng cummins engine company, ltd. of $16 million and chongqing cummins engine company, ltd. of $10 million. these decreases were partially offset by higher earnings at beijing foton cummins engine co., ltd. of $64 million as it continues to increase market share with the new heavy-duty engine platform introduced in 2014.
loss contingency charge in 2015, we recorded a charge of $60 million for a loss contingency. see note 12, "commitments and contingencies," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
impairment of light-duty diesel assets in 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $211 million. see note 19, "impairment of light-duty diesel assets," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
restructuring actions and other charges in 2015, we incurred a charge of $90 million which included $86 million for the severance costs related to both voluntary and involuntary terminations and $4 million for asset impairments and other charges. see note 20, "restructuring actions and other charges," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

(1) see note 18, "acquisitions," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
income tax expense our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent u.s. statutory income tax rate, primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. our effective tax rate for 2015 was 27.4 percent compared to 28.7 percent for 2014. the 1.3 percent decrease in our effective tax rate from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions related to a favorable audit settlement and favorable changes in the jurisdictional mix of pre-tax income.
noncontrolling interests noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased $14 million, primarily due to lower earnings at wuxi cummins turbo technologies co. ltd. and a decline from the acquisition of the remaining interest in previously consolidated north american distributors since december 31, 2013.
net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to cummins inc. decreased $252 million and $1.18 per share primarily due to our impairment of light-duty diesel assets, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, restructuring actions, loss contingency charge, lower other income as a result of larger gains recognized in 2014 from the acquisition of north american distributors and lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees. these decreases were partially offset by improved gross margin, lower research, development and engineering expenses and a lower effective tax rate of 27.4 percent in 2015 versus 28.7 percent in 2014. diluted earnings per share for 2015 benefited $0.14 per share from lower shares outstanding, primarily due to purchases under the stock repurchase program.

operating segment results our reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves. we use segment ebit as the primary basis for the chief operating decision maker (codm) to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments.
as previously announced, beginning with the second quarter of 2016, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with changes to our organizational structure and how the codm monitors the performance of our segments. we reorganized our business to combine our power generation segment and our high-horsepower engine business to create the new power systems segment. our reportable operating segments consist of engine, distribution, components and power systems. we began to report results for our new reporting structure in the second quarter of 2016 and also reflected this change for historical periods. the formation of the power systems segment combined two businesses that were already strongly interdependent, which will allow us to streamline business and technical processes to accelerate innovation, grow market share and more efficiently manage our supply chain and manufacturing operations.
we allocate certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments. these include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal, finance and supply chain management. in addition to the reorganization noted above, we reevaluated the allocation of these costs, considering the new segment structure created in april 2016 and adjusted our allocation methodology accordingly. the revised methodology, which is based on a combination of relative segment sales and relative service usage levels, is effective for the periods beginning after january 1, 2016 and resulted in the revision of our segment operating results, including segment ebit, for all four segments for the first quarter of 2016 with a greater share of costs allocated to the distribution and components segments than in previous years. prior periods were not revised for the new allocation methodology. these changes had no impact on our consolidated results.

net cash provided by operating activities decreased $124 million versus 2015, primarily due to the absence of the 2015 impairment of light-duty diesel assets of $211 million and a $123 million year over year impact related to restructuring, partially offset by an increase in deferred income taxes of $158 million and higher loss contingency charges of $62 million resulting in lower cash net income in 2016.
net cash used in investing activities decreased $1 million versus 2015, primarily due to lower capital expenditures of $213 million and proceeds from the sale of equity investees of $60 million, partially offset by higher net investments in marketable securities of $160 million and changes in cash flows from derivatives not designated as hedges of $110 million.
net cash used in financing activities decreased $235 million versus 2015, primarily due to higher net borrowings of commercial paper of $212 million, lower common stock repurchases of $122 million and higher proceeds from borrowings of $67 million, partially offset by higher acquisitions of noncontrolling interests of $88 million and higher payments on borrowings and capital lease obligations of $87 million.
the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents decreased $113 million versus 2015, primarily due to the british pound, which decreased cash and cash equivalents by $112 million.
net cash provided by operating activities decreased $207 million versus 2014, primarily due to lower consolidated net income of $266 million and unfavorable working capital fluctuations of $328 million, partially offset by the impact of the non-cash impairment of light-duty diesel assets of $211 million. during 2015, the higher working capital requirements resulted in a cash outflow of $260 million compared to a cash inflow of $68 million in 2014. this change of $328 million was primarily driven by a decrease in accrued expenses and accounts payable, partially offset by a decrease in inventory and accounts and notes receivable.
net cash used in investing activities decreased $316 million versus 2014, primarily due to lower cash investment for the acquisitions of businesses of $319 million.
net cash used in financing activities increased $301 million versus 2014, primarily due to higher common stock repurchases of $230 million and higher dividend payments of $110 million.

in millions                                                                      total              u.s.            international       primary location of international balances cash and cash equivalents                                                   $1,120              $323                  $797              u.k., singapore, china marketable securities (1)                                                      260                40                   220              india, china total                                                                       $1,380              $363                $1,017

international and other uncommitted domestic credit facilities (3)             128
(1) the majority of marketable securities could be liquidated into cash within a few days.
(2) the revolving credit facility is maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes. at december 31, 2016, we had $212 million of commercial paper outstanding, which effectively reduced the $1.75 billion available capacity under our revolving credit facility to $1.54 billion.
(3) the available capacity is net of letters of credit.
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities a significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the u.s. the geographic location of our cash and marketable securities aligns well with our ongoing investments. we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. as a result, we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our operating needs with local resources.
if we distribute our foreign cash balances to the u.s. or to other foreign subsidiaries, we could be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes, for example, if we repatriated cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings we have asserted are permanently reinvested outside of the u.s. foreign earnings for which we assert permanent reinvestment outside the u.s. consist primarily of earnings of our china and u.k. domiciled subsidiaries. at present, we do not foresee a need to repatriate any earnings from these subsidiaries for which we have asserted permanent reinvestment. however, to help fund cash needs of the u.s. or other international subsidiaries as they arise, we repatriate available cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are not permanently reinvested when it is cost effective to do so. earnings generated after december 31, 2011, from our china operations are considered permanently reinvested, while earnings generated prior to january 1, 2012, for which u.s. deferred tax liabilities have been recorded, are expected to be repatriated in future years.
debt facilities and other sources of liquidity in february 2016, the board of directors authorized the issuance of up to $1.75 billion of unsecured short-term promissory notes ("commercial paper") pursuant to a commercial paper program. the program will facilitate the private placement of unsecured short-term debt through third party brokers. we intend to use the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes.
we have a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which can be used for general corporate purposes. this facility expires on november 13, 2020. the revolving credit facility is maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings, letters of credit and general corporate purposes. the total combined borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper program should not exceed $1.75 billion. see note 9, "debt," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. the credit agreement includes one financial covenant: a leverage ratio. the required leverage ratio, which measures the sum of total debt plus securitization financing to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, for the four fiscal quarters ended on such date may not exceed 3.5 to 1.0. at december 31, 2016, our leverage ratio was 0.75 to 1.0.
as a well-known seasoned issuer, we filed an automatic shelf registration for an undetermined amount of debt and equity securities with the securities and exchange commission on february 16, 2016. under this shelf registration we may offer, from time to time, debt securities, common stock, preferred and preference stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units.
the maturity schedule of our existing long-term debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term. required annual principal payments range from $4 million to $35 million over each of the next five years.
uses of cash share repurchases in december 2016, our board of directors authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of additional common stock upon completion of the 2015 repurchase plan. in november 2015, our board of directors authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of additional common stock upon the completion of the 2014 repurchase plan. in 2016, we made the following purchases under the respective purchase programs:

(1) the remaining authorized capacity under the 2015 plan was calculated based on the cost to purchase the shares but excludes commission expenses in accordance with the authorized plan.
in 2016, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a third party financial institution to repurchase $500 million of our common stock under our previously announced share repurchase plans and received 4.7 million shares at an average purchase price of $105.50 per share.
dividends total dividends paid to common shareholders in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $676 million, $622 million and $512 million, respectively. declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon our income and liquidity position, among other factors, and is subject to declaration by our board of directors, who meet quarterly to consider our dividend payment. we expect to fund dividend payments with cash from operations.
capital expenditures capital expenditures and spending on internal use software were $594 million in 2016, compared to $799 million in 2015. we continue to invest in new product lines and targeted capacity expansions. we plan to spend between $500 million and $530 million in 2017 on capital expenditures as we continue with product launches and facility improvements. approximately 50 percent of our capital expenditures are expected to be invested outside of the u.s. in 2017.
pensions the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets, market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans. in 2016, the investment return on our u.s. pension trust was 7.2 percent while our u.k. pension trust return was 25.5 percent. approximately 78 percent of our pension plan assets are held in highly liquid investments such as fixed income and equity securities. the remaining 22 percent of our plan assets are held in less liquid, but market valued investments, including real estate, private equity, venture capital, opportunistic credit and insurance contracts.
we sponsor funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans. contributions to these plans were as follows:
defined benefit pension plans voluntary contribution                         $133                 $82                $111
defined benefit pension contributions           134                 190                 205
we anticipate making total contributions of approximately $134 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2017. expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2017 will meet or exceed the current funding requirements.
restructuring actions in 2015, we executed worldwide work force restructuring actions primarily in the form of professional voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs in response to lower demand for our products in the u.s. and key markets around the world. we incurred a charge of $90 million ($61 million after-tax) for the headcount reductions, with $86 million expected to be settled in cash. in 2016, we paid $58 million and as of december 31, 2016, substantially all terminations were complete. see note 20, "restructuring actions and other charges," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
acquisitions during 2016, we paid $109 million to acquire the remaining interest in the last two partially owned north american distributors, including the related debt retirements, and recognized a total gain of $15 million on the fair value adjustment resulting from the acquisition of the controlling interest in the previously unconsolidated entity. see note 18, "acquisitions," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
credit ratings our ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies as of the date of filing are shown in the table below.

management's assessment of liquidity our financial condition and liquidity remain strong. our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit and the capital markets. we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. we believe our operating cash flow and liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital, common stock repurchases, capital expenditures, dividend payments, projected pension obligations and debt service obligations. we continue to generate cash from operations in the u.s. and maintain access to our revolving credit facility as noted above.

the contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of $59 million as of december 31, 2016. we are not able to reasonably estimate the period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur. see note 3, "income taxes," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

application of critical accounting estimates a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies," of our consolidated financial statements which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives.
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. (gaap) which often requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. in any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors. we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs, accounting for income taxes and pension benefits.
warranty programs we estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold. our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management's best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ. as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable, which generally occurs when it is announced. our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates, repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle. future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability. new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch, with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch. we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding product's warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation. we then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters, and new product specific experience thereafter. note 10, "product warranty liability," to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2016 and 2015 including adjustments to pre-existing warranties.
accounting for income taxes we determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. future tax benefits of net operating loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. at december 31, 2016, we recorded net deferred tax assets of $344 million. these assets included $313 million for the value of net operating loss and credit carryforwards. a valuation allowance of $307 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. in the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. in addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. these audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. we accrue for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions. we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in note 3, "income taxes," to our consolidated financial statements.
pension benefits we sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the u.s. and the u.k. and to a lesser degree in various other countries. in the u.s. and the u.k., we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. we account for our pension programs in accordance with employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under gaap. gaap requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. as a result, our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at december 31. these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover rates, actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span and withdrawal rates. these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension cost to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future.
the expected long-term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension cost. we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets. the long-term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a five-year average market value of return. projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded fixed income and equity indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. at december 31, 2016, based upon our target asset allocations, it is anticipated that our u.s. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 10-year projection period equal to or in excess of 7.25 percent approximately 35 percent of the time while returns of 8.0 percent or greater are anticipated 26 percent of the time, including the additional positive returns expected from active investment management. despite the 2016 one-year return of 7.2 percent, our plan assets have averaged 10.0 percent returns since 2010, and resulted in approximately $271 million of
the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the u.k. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. at december 31, 2016, based upon our target asset allocations, it is anticipated that our u.k. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20-year projection period equal to or in excess of 3.9 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 4.6 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time. we expect additional positive returns from active investment management. the one-year return for our u.k. plan was 25.5 percent for 2016, and similar to our u.s. plan, the strong returns since 2010 have resulted in approximately $544 million of actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income. our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long-term outlook. therefore, the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 4.5 percent in 2017 for u.k. pension assets is reasonable. our pension plan asset allocations at december 31, 2016 and 2015 and target allocation for 2017 are as follows:
equity securities                 24.0          %            29.0          %                  21.5          %            23.0          %            30.4          %                  39.0          %
a lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension cost and reduce profitability.
gaap for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results. it is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences. under the delayed recognition alternative, changes in pension obligation (including those resulting from plan amendments) and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligations are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods. in addition to this approach, gaap also allows immediate recognition of actuarial gains or losses. immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results. we have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods. if we adopted the immediate recognition approach, we would record a loss of $951 million ($634 million after-tax) from cumulative actuarial net losses for our u.s. and u.k. pension plans.
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and, under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation, amortized over future years of service. this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions. under gaap, the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. at december 31, 2016, we had net pension actuarial losses of $770 million and $172 million for the u.s. and u.k. pension plans, respectively. as these amounts exceed 10 percent of their respective plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees. net actuarial losses decreased our shareholders' equity by $65 million after-tax in 2016. the loss is due to lower discount rates in the u.s. and u.k. and unfavorable foreign currency, partially offset by strong asset performance in the u.k.
we expect 2017 net periodic pension cost to increase compared to 2016, primarily due to onboarding a significant portion of our newly acquired north american distributors to cummins pension benefits, a lower expected rate of return in the u.s. and u.k. and lower discount rates in the u.s. and u.k. the decrease in net periodic pension cost in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to reduced loss amortizations in the u.s. and u.k. and higher discount rates in the u.s. and u.k., partially offset by lower expected asset returns in the u.k. as we de-risked plan trust assets. the increase in net periodic pension cost in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to lower discount rates in the u.s. and u.k. and unfavorable mortality demographics in the u.s. another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension cost is the discount rate. the weighted average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension cost are set forth in the table below.
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in gaap which suggests the use of a high-quality corporate bond rate. we used bond information provided by moody's investor services, inc. and standard & poor's rating services. all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the u.s. and u.k. were deemed high-quality, non-callable bonds (aa or better) at december 31, 2016, by at least one of the bond rating agencies.
our model called for projected payments until near extinction for the u.s. and the u.k. for both countries, our model matches the present value of the plan's projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio. a single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio. the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan's distinct liability characteristics.
discount rate used to value liabilities
the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension cost. a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension cost. it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. note 8, "pension and other postretirement benefits," to our consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity, the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements.
recently issued accounting pronouncements in august 2016, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) amended its standards related to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments. the new standard will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. if
an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. an entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. the new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. we are in the process of evaluating the impact this standard will have on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
in june 2016, the fasb amended its standards related to the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments. this amendment introduces new guidance for accounting for credit losses on instruments including trade receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. the new rules are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2019. early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. we are in the process of evaluating the impact the amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements.
in march 2016, the fasb amended its standards related to the accounting for stock compensation. this amendment addresses several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions that could impact us including, but not limited to, recognition of excess tax benefits or deficiencies in the income statement each period and classification of the excess tax benefits or deficiencies as operating activities in the cash flow statement. the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016. the adoption of this standard could result in future volatility in our income tax expense since all excess tax benefits and deficiencies are now recorded in the income statement. we are unable to estimate this impact since the amount of excess benefits and deficiencies are dependent on our stock price at the time a stock award vests or is exercised.
in february 2016, the fasb amended its standards related to the accounting for leases. under the new standard, lessees will now be required to recognize substantially all leases on the balance sheet as both a right-of-use-asset and a liability. the standard will continue to have two types of leases for income statement recognition purposes: operating leases and finance leases. operating leases will result in the recognition of a single lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term similar to the treatment for operating leases under today's standards. finance leases will result in an accelerated expense similar to the accounting for capital leases under today's standards. the determination of a lease classification as operating or finance will be done in a manner similar to today's standard. the new standard also contains amended guidance regarding the identification of embedded leases in service contracts and the identification of lease and non-lease components in an arrangement. the new standard is effective on january 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. we are still evaluating the impact the standard could have on our consolidated financial statements; however, while we have not yet quantified the amount, we do expect the standard will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets due to the recognition of additional assets and liabilities for operating leases.
in january 2016, the fasb amended its standards related to the accounting for certain financial instruments. this amendment addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. the new rules will become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is not permitted. we are in the process of evaluating the impact the amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements.
in may 2014, the fasb amended its standards related to revenue recognition. this amendment replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance and provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. the standard contains principles that we will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. the underlying principle is that we will recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. the guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs, consideration of the time value of money in the transaction price and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. the amendment also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in those judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract. the standard allows either full or modified retrospective adoption effective for annual and interim periods beginning january 1, 2018. we are in the process of evaluating the impact the amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements. we expect to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach. while we have not yet completed our evaluation process, we have identified that a change will be required related to our accounting for remanufactured product sales that include an exchange of the used product, referred to as core. revenue is not currently recognized related to the core component unless the used product is not returned. under the new standard, the transaction will be accounted for as a gross sale and a purchase of inventory. as a result the exchange will increase both sales and cost of sales, in equal amounts, related to the used core. this will not impact gross margin dollars, but will impact the gross margin percentage. we are still quantifying the amount of this change. we have also identified transactions where revenue recognition is currently limited to the amount of billings not contingent on our future performance. with the allocation provisions of the new model, we expect to accelerate the
timing of revenue recognition for amounts related to satisfied performance obligations that would have been delayed under the current guidance. we do not expect the impact of this change to be material, but we are still quantifying the impact.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
the following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of abbvie inc. (abbvie or the company) as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2015. this commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
executive overview company overview abbvie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company formed in 2013 following separation from abbott laboratories (abbott). abbvie's mission is to use its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. abbvie's products are focused on treating conditions such as chronic autoimmune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology; oncology, including blood cancers; virology, including hepatitis c (hcv) and human immunodeficiency virus (hiv); neurological disorders, such as parkinson's disease; metabolic diseases, including thyroid disease and complications associated with cystic fibrosis; as well as other serious health conditions. abbvie also has a pipeline of promising new medicines across such important medical specialties as immunology, virology/liver disease, oncology, neurology, cystic fibrosis and women's health.
abbvie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies, and independent retailers from abbvie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. in the united states, abbvie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. outside the united states, sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. abbvie has approximately 28,000 employees. abbvie operates in one business segmentpharmaceutical products.
on may 26, 2015, abbvie completed its acquisition of pharmacyclics, inc. (pharmacyclics), a biopharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes novel therapies for people impacted by cancer, and its flagship asset imbruvica® (ibrutinib), a novel, orally active, selective covalent inhibitor of bruton's tyrosine kinase (btk). as part of a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with janssen biotech, inc., one of the janssen pharmaceutical companies of johnson & johnson (janssen), imbruvica is approved for use in the united states, canada, and the european union (eu) as well as in other countries worldwide. in the united states, abbvie co-markets imbruvica for four indications approved by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) prior to the acquisition date: (i) for the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) who have received at least one prior therapy; (ii) for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) who have received at least one prior therapy; (iii) for the treatment of cll patients with deletion of the short arm chromosome 17 (del 17p cll); and (iv) for the treatment of patients with waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. in the eu, janssen markets imbruvica. at the date of the acquisition, imbruvica was indicated in the eu for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mcl, or adult patients with cll who have received at least one prior therapy, or in first-line in the presence of 17p deletion or tp53 mutation in patients unsuitable for chemoimmunotherapy.
the acquisition will accelerate abbvie's clinical and commercial presence in oncology, strengthen its pipeline, and establish a leadership position in hematological oncology. the acquisition will also accelerate abbvie's revenue and earnings growth and further diversify its revenue base. abbvie expects the acquisition to be accretive to earnings beginning in 2017. refer to note 5 entitled "licensing, acquisitions and other arrangements" of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included under

part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" for further information regarding the acquisition of pharmacyclics.
2015 financial results abbvie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline, and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. in 2015, abbvie's worldwide net revenues grew by 15 percent to $22.9 billion, driven primarily by the continued strength of humira, both in the united states and internationally, the global launch of abbvie's interferon-free hcv treatment, revenue growth in other key products including creon and duodopa, and post-acquisition revenues related to imbruvica. these increases were partially offset by a decline in net revenues of androgel, principally due to continued market declines and the entry of generic competition for the androgel 1% formulation, as well as the continued decline of the company's lipid franchise, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
the company's financial performance in 2015 included delivering fully diluted earnings per share of $3.13, including after-tax costs totaling $410 million incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of pharmacyclics, a $350 million after-tax charge for the purchase of a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher (prv) from united therapeutics corporation, a $100 million after-tax charge as a result of entering into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with c2n diagnostics (c2n), after-tax foreign exchange losses of $170 million as a result of the liquidation in 2015 of remaining foreign currency positions related to the terminated proposed combination with shire plc (shire) in 2014, after-tax charges of $129 million to increase the company's litigation reserves, and an $83 million after-tax charge due to the achievement of a development milestone under the global collaboration with infinity pharmaceuticals, inc. (infinity). refer to note 5 for further information regarding these items. abbvie's financial performance in 2015 also reflected an improvement in gross margin to 80 percent of net revenues, primarily due to favorable product mix across the product portfolio, operating efficiencies, and the impact of foreign exchange rates. financial results for 2015 also reflected continued funding in support of abbvie's emerging mid-and late-stage pipeline assets, continued investment in abbvie's growth brands, and the global launch of abbvie's interferon-free hcv treatment, viekira pak.
in 2015, the company generated cash flows from operations of $7.5 billion. these cash flows enabled the company to pay cash dividends to shareholders of $3.3 billion, repurchase approximately 46 million shares for $2.8 billion in the open market (excluding the shares repurchased under an accelerated repurchase agreement), and continue to enhance its pipeline through licensing and collaboration activities including a $500 million payment to calico life sciences llc (calico) as a result of the satisfaction of certain conditions under the research and development (r&d) collaboration with calico for which a charge to acquired in-process research and development (ipr&d) was recorded in 2014. in addition, abbvie issued $16.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes the proceeds of which were used to finance the acquisition of pharmacyclics and a $5.0 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement (asr) pursuant to which abbvie paid $5.0 billion for an aggregate 73 million shares of abbvie's common stock. in october 2015, abbvie's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock payable in february 2016. this reflects an increase of approximately 12 percent over the previous quarterly rate of $0.51 per share of common stock.
2016 strategic objectives abbvie's mission is to be an innovation-driven, patient-focused specialty biopharmaceutical company capable of achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution and a consistent stream of innovative new medicines. abbvie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including (i) growing revenues through continued strong performance from its existing portfolio of on-market products, including its flagship brands, humira, imbruvica and viekira pak, as well as growth from pipeline products; (ii) expanding gross and operating margins; (iii) continued investment in its pipeline
in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, and virology, as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) augmentation of its pipeline through concerted focus on strategic licensing, acquisition and partnering activity with a focus on identifying compelling programs that fit abbvie's strategic criteria; and (v) returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. in addition, abbvie anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from key clinical trials in 2016.
abbvie expects to achieve its revenue growth objectives as follows:
 humira sales growth by driving biologic penetration across disease categories, increasing market leadership, strong commercial execution and expansion to new indications for hidradenitis suppurativa (regulatory approval in the united states and eu achieved in 2015) and uveitis (regulatory submissions in the united states and the eu are under review with approval expected in 2016).
 imbruvica revenue growth driven by increasing market share within its four currently approved indications as well as indication expansion of imbruvica as a first-line therapy for cll (currently under priority review by the fda). revenues for 2016 will also benefit from a full year of imbruvica revenue.
 viekira pak revenue growth driven by continued uptake across geographies, including japan, the second largest hcv market globally, as well as indication expansion for a once-daily, fixed-dosed formulation of viekira pak to treat genotype 1 (gt1) hcv (currently under review).
 the favorable impact of pipeline products approved in 2015 or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2016
including venetoclax, empliciti (elotuzumab), and zinbryta (daclizumab). these pipeline products are described in greater detail in the section labeled "research and development" included as part of this item 7.
in 2016, abbvie remains committed to driving continued expansion of gross and operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through productivity initiatives in supply chain, ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses, and continued leverage from revenue growth. abbvie also remains committed to returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.
research and development research and innovation are the cornerstones of abbvie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. abbvie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.
abbvie's pipeline currently includes more than 50 compounds or indications in clinical development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology, virology/liver disease, and neurology along with targeted investments in renal disease, cystic fibrosis, and women's health. of these programs, more than 30 are in mid- and late-stage development.
the following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from phase 2 development to phase 3 development as well as developments in significant phase 3 and registration programs. abbvie expects multiple phase 2 programs to transition into phase 3 programs during 2016.

significant clinical programs approved or submitted abbvie submitted for review or received approval for the following significant late-stage development programs:
 the fda granted humira orphan drug designation for the treatment of moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa (hs), a painful, chronic inflammatory skin disease. abbvie's supplemental biological license application (bla) in the united states and its marketing authorization in the eu were approved by the fda and the european medicines agency (ema) in 2015, respectively. approval for this indication represents the thirteenth indication for humira in major geographies around the world.
 in april 2015 abbvie announced that the european commission (ec) granted marketing authorization for humira for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescence from four years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical therapy and phototherapies. with the ec decision, humira is now approved for use in this indication in all member states of the eu.
 abbvie submitted regulatory applications in the united states and the eu for the use of humira in the treatment of uveitis. abbvie expects to receive regulatory approval in 2016.
 in july 2015, abbvie announced that the ec granted marketing authorization for imbruvica as the first treatment option specifically approved for treatment of adult patients with waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, a rare, slow growing blood cancer. pharmacyclics received fda approval for imbruvica for patients with waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia in january 2015. the ec approval triggered a $20 million milestone payment from janssen.
 in september 2015, abbvie announced that it submitted a supplemental new drug application (snda) to the fda for imbruvica for treatment-naïve cll patients. the snda is based on results from the phase 3 resonate-2 study, which evaluated efficacy and safety of imbruvica versus traditional chemotherapy, chlorambucil, in treatment-naïve cll patients aged 65 years or older. the application has received a priority review.
 in november 2015, abbvie submitted a snda to the fda for labeling considerations based on safety and efficacy results from the phase 3 helios trial investigating the use of imbruvica, bendamustine, and rituximab, versus placebo plus bendamustine and rituximab, in patients with relapsed/refractory cll or small lymphocytic lymphoma.
 in february 2016, the fda granted imbruvica orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with extranodal marginal zone lymphoma.
 abbvie submitted regulatory applications in the united states and the eu for venetoclax (abt-199), an inhibitor of the b-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2) protein developed in collaboration with genentech and roche holding ag. priority review status was granted by the fda and validation provided by the ema for these submissions.
venetoclax is also in phase 3 development for patients with relapsed/refractory cll. in addition, venetoclax was granted three breakthrough therapy designations by the fda: (i) for the treatment of cll in previously treated (relapsed/refractory) patients with the 17p deletion mutation; (ii) in combination with rituximab for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory cll, including patients with chromosome 17p deletion; and (iii) in combination with hypomethylating agents for the treatment of patients with untreated (treatment-naïve) acute
 registration submissions were submitted to the fda and the ec for empliciti (elotuzumab), a signaling lymphocyte activation molecule
(slam7)-directed immunostimulatory antibody developed in partnership with bristol-myers squibb (bms) for first-line and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (mm). subsequently, the ema validated for review the marketing authorization application for empliciti (elotuzumab) for the treatment of mm as combination therapy in adult patients who have received one or more prior therapies. the application was granted accelerated assessment by the ema's committee for medicinal products for human use (chmp). in addition, the fda approved empliciti (elotuzumab) for the treatment of mm as a combination therapy in patients who have received one to three prior therapies. this is the first fda approval for an immune-stimulatory antibody for mm in this indication. empliciti will be marketed by bms.
 on january 16, 2015, abbvie announced that the ec granted marketing authorizations for its all-oral, short-course, interferon-free treatment viekirax (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir tablets) + exviera (dasabuvir tablets). the treatment was approved with or without ribavirin (rbv) for patients with gt1 chronic hcv infection, including those with compensated liver cirrhosis, hiv-1 co-infection, patients on opioid substitution therapy and liver transplant recipients. additionally, viekirax/exviera was approved for use with rbv in genotype 4 (gt4) chronic hcv patients.
 abbvie's regulatory application in japan for the company's all-oral, rbv and interferon-free, 12-week, two direct-acting antiviral treatment of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (obv/ptv/r), dosed once daily, was approved in september 2015 for the treatment of patients with gt1 chronic hcv infection.
 in july 2015, the fda approved abbvie's regulatory application for technivie (obv/ptv/r tablets) in combination with rbv for the treatment of adults with gt4 chronic hcv infection who do not have cirrhosis. technivie is the first and only all-oral, interferon-free, direct-acting antiviral treatment approved in the united states for adult patients with gt4 chronic hcv infection.
 abbvie submitted a regulatory application in the united states for a once-daily, fixed-dosed formulation of viekira pak to treat gt1
hcv. the proposed dosing for the fixed-dose formulation is three oral tablets, taken once daily with a meal, with or without rbv. abbvie anticipates regulatory action on the new formulation in 2016.
 the fda accepted abbvie's snda and granted priority review for viekira pak without rbv in patients with genotype 1b (gt1b)
 on january 12, 2015, abbvie announced that the fda approved duopa (carbidopa and levodopa), an enteral suspension for the treatment of motor fluctuations for people with advanced parkinson's disease. duopa is administered using a small, portable infusion pump that delivers carbidopa and levodopa directly into the small intestine for 16 continuous hours via a procedurally-placed tube. this product is sold under the name duodopa outside the united states.
 abbvie is collaborating with biogen to develop zinbryta (daclizumab), an anti-cd25 monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of the relapsing/remitting form of multiple sclerosis (ms). in february 2015, the registration submission for zinbryta was made in the united states followed by the eu submission in march 2015. in march, abbvie and biogen announced that the ema had validated the companies' marketing authorization application for zinbryta for the treatment of relapsing forms of ms in the eu. validation confirms that the submission is complete and signifies the initiation of the
| 2015 form
review process by the chmp. in april 2015, abbvie and biogen announced that the fda accepted for review the registration submission in the united states.
other significant developments transitions of significant programs from phase 2 to phase 3 development, as well as other significant developments, included the following:
 in january 2016, abbvie announced the commencement of a phase 3 clinical trial program to study the use of abbvie's once-daily formulation of abt-494, its internally developed investigational selective janus kinase 1 (jak-1) inhibitor, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. a phase 2 trial of abt-494 for the treatment of crohn's disease is also ongoing.
 in 2015, abbvie received a decision by the ec regarding compliance with its pediatric investigation plan for humira, which ensures that necessary data are obtained through studies in children. as a result of this positive decision, the company is seeking an extension from each eu member state where a supplementary protection certificate is held. once approved, this will extend the humira composition of matter patent in the eu by six months from april 2018 to october 2018.
 in july 2015, abbvie initiated a phase 3 study for the use of veliparib (abt-888), a parp-inhibitor, for the treatment of ovarian cancer in combination with chemotherapy. veliparib is also in phase 3 development for various forms of breast and lung cancer.
 abbvie recently initiated its first phase 3 clinical trial for imbruvica in solid tumors. the trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of imbruvica in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
 in october 2015, in consultation with the fda, the product inserts in the united states for viekira pak and technivie were updated from "not recommended in child-pugh b patients" to a contraindication in patients with child-pugh b cirrhosis. patients classified as child-pugh c remained contraindicated as they have been since approval.
 in january 2016, abbvie initiated a phase 3 clinical trial program evaluating the safety and efficacy of its next-generation, all-oral, once-daily, pan-genotypic, rbv-free investigational hcv regimen, which includes abt-493, a ns3/4a protease inhibitor, and abt-530, an ns5a inhibitor.
 abbvie is developing a novel oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh) antagonist, elagolix, under a collaboration with neurocrine biosciences (neurocrine) for the treatment of endometriosis-related pain and uterine fibroids. in january 2016, abbvie announced the initiation of the first of two planned phase 3 studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of elagolix in the treatment of patients with uterine fibroids. abbvie will make a milestone payment of $15 million to neurocrine upon enrollment of the first patient. elagolix is in late-stage development for endometriosis.
 in 2012, abbvie entered into a collaboration with galapagos nv (galapagos) to develop filgotinib, an oral jak1 inhibitor. in
2015, following a thorough review of available data, abbvie announced that it will not exercise its right to in-license filgotinib from galapagos. pursuant to the terms of the global collaboration agreement with galapagos, all rights to filgotinib reverted solely to galapagos.
in 2015, abbvie also augmented its pipeline through strategic licensing and partnering activities including in-licensing an anti-tau antibody (abbv-8e12) for the treatment of alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders from c2n, a privately held protein diagnostic and therapeutic discovery company. refer to note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" for further information regarding the license agreement with c2n.
results of operations net revenues the comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. this measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current period. abbvie believes that the non-gaap measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the gaap measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

global humira sales increased 19 percent in both 2015 and 2014, primarily as a result of market growth across therapeutic categories and geographies, higher market share, approval of new indications, and favorable pricing in certain geographies. in the united states, humira revenues increased 29 percent in 2015 and 25 percent in 2014, driven by prescription volume, favorable pricing, and market growth across all indications. internationally, humira revenues increased 9 percent in 2015 and 13 percent in 2014, driven primarily by growth across indications in certain geographies. abbvie continues to pursue several new indications to help further differentiate humira from competing products and add to the sustainability and future growth of humira.
net revenues for imbruvica represent product revenues in the united states as well as collaboration revenues related to abbvie's 50 percent share of imbruvica profit outside of the united states following the completion of the acquisition of pharmacyclics on may 26, 2015. abbvie expects imbruvica will be a significant contributor to revenue growth in 2016.
abbvie launched its hcv regimen, viekira pak, in the united states following fda approval in mid-december 2014 and launched viekirax/exviera in the eu in january 2015. in addition to growth in approved markets, international revenues continued to increase during 2015 as the product was approved in additional geographies. net revenues of viekira pak in 2014 reflect the shipment of launch quantities into the market to support full commercial launch in 2015.
net revenues for creon increased 22 percent in 2015 and 25 percent in 2014, driven primarily by continued market growth and higher market share. creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market.
synagis is a seasonal product with the majority of sales occurring in the first and fourth quarters. net revenues increased 1 percent in 2015 and 9 percent in 2014. revenues in 2015 reflected changes in demand in certain markets, as well as an unfavorable comparison to 2014 driven by a less severe respiratory syncytial virus season.
global lupron net revenues increased 9 percent in 2015 primarily due to increased demand and favorable pricing in the united states. lupron continues to hold a leadership position and maintains significant share of the market.
global kaletra net revenues declined 10 percent in 2015 and 7 percent in 2014 primarily due to lower market share resulting from the impact of increasing competition in the hiv marketplace.
androgel net revenues declined 26 percent in 2015 and 10 percent in 2014, primarily due to a continued decline in the overall u.s. testosterone replacement market and the entry of generic competition for the androgel 1% formulation in january 2015. the company expects the u.s. testosterone replacement market will continue to decline in 2016.
net revenues for duodopa, abbvie's therapy for advanced parkinson's disease approved in europe and other international markets, grew 23 percent in 2015. abbvie's regulatory submission for duopa in the united states was approved by the fda in january 2015. abbvie expects net revenues for duopa in the united states will continue to gradually increase during 2016 as the product gains acceptance in the marketplace.
net revenues for abbvie's consolidated lipid franchise, which included tricor, trilipix, niaspan, simcor and advicor, declined 45 percent in 2015 and 70 percent in 2014 due to the introduction of generic versions of these products in the u.s. market. generic competition began in november 2012 for tricor, july 2013 for trilipix, and september 2013 for niaspan. abbvie has voluntarily withdrawn simcor and advicor from the market and discontinued distribution as of december 31, 2015.

all other net revenues declined 21 percent in 2015 primarily due to reduced demand driven by market and share declines and a reduction in price for several of abbvie's mature on-market products.
the gross margin for 2015, 2014 and 2013 reflected the favorable impact of product mix across the product portfolio, including humira, operational efficiencies, and price increases, partially offset by the effect of unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the loss of exclusivity for the lipid franchise. gross margin in 2015 also includes milestone revenue of $40 million from a collaboration partner related the company's oncology program. gross margin in 2014 also includes royalty income of $81 million relating to prior periods as a result of the settlement of a licensing arrangement and lower amortization expense for intangible assets, partially offset by a $37 million impairment charge for an intangible asset.
selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses declined in 2015 compared to 2014, principally due to the absence of transaction-related costs totaling $1.7 billion incurred in 2014 in connection with the termination of the proposed combination with shire, as further discussed in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. sg&a expenses in 2014 also included a $129 million charge related to the branded prescription drug fee due to the issuance of final rules which resulted in an additional year of expense in 2014. refer to note 13 for further information.
excluding these items, sg&a expenses increased in both 2015 and 2014, reflecting increased selling and marketing support for new products, including the global launch of viekira, as well as spending relating to new indications and geographic expansion for humira and other growth brands. sg&a expenses in 2015 also included pharmacyclics acquisition and integration costs of $294 million, charges aggregating $165 million to increase the company's litigation reserves and restructuring charges of $39 million. these increased costs were partially offset by the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates in 2015.
research and development and acquired in-process research and development

r&d expenses for 2015 included pharmacyclics acquisition and integration costs of $152 million, a $350 million charge related to the purchase of a priority review voucher from a third party, a $130 million
charge recorded due to the achievement of a development milestone under the collaboration with infinity, the post-acquisition r&d expenses of pharmacyclics, and restructuring charges of $32 million. r&d expenses in 2014 and 2013 included regulatory milestone payments of $40 million made to a collaboration partner for regulatory milestones related to the company's hcv program and restructuring charges of $15 million, respectively.
r&d expenses in 2015 and 2014 otherwise reflected added funding to support the company's emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline assets and the continued pursuit of additional humira indications. these increases were partially offset by the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates in 2015 and 2014.
ipr&d expenses in 2015 included a charge of $100 million as a result of entering into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with c2n to develop and commercialize anti-tau antibodies for the treatment of alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders. ipr&d expenses in 2014 included a charge of $275 million as a result of entering into a global collaboration with infinity to develop and commercialize duvelisib, a treatment for patients with cancer. ipr&d expense in 2013 included a charge of $175 million as a result of entering into a global license agreement with ablynx nv to develop and commercialize alx-0061, a charge of $70 million as a result of entering into a global collaboration with alvine pharmaceuticals, inc. to develop alv003, a charge of $45 million as a result of entering into a global collaboration with galapagos for cystic fibrosis therapies, and charges totaling $48 million as a result of entering into several other arrangements. refer to note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the company's collaborations and other arrangements.
other operating expenses other operating expenses in 2014 included a $750 million charge related to an r&d collaboration agreement entered into in september 2014 with calico to discover, develop and commercialize new therapies for patients with age-related diseases.
other non-operating expenses interest expense, net was $686 million in 2015, $391 million in 2014, and $278 million in 2013 and was comprised primarily of interest expense on outstanding debt. interest expense, net in 2015 increased due to the may 2015 issuance of $16.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, which were issued primarily to finance the acquisition of pharmacyclics and an accelerated share repurchase program. interest expense, net in 2015 also included $86 million of bridge financing related fees incurred in connection with the acquisition of pharmacyclics. interest expense, net in 2014 included $141 million of financing related fees incurred in connection with the terminated proposed combination with shire.
in 2014, abbvie entered into certain undesignated forward contracts to hedge the then anticipated foreign currency cash outflows associated with the then proposed combination with shire. net foreign exchange loss for 2014 included losses of $666 million associated with the shire-related forward contracts. net foreign exchange loss for 2015 included losses totaling $170 million to reflect the completed liquidation of the company's remaining foreign currency positions related to the terminated proposed combination with shire.
other non-operating expense, net for 2015 included impairment charges totaling $36 million related to certain of the company's equity investment securities. other non-operating income, net, in 2014 primarily consisted of income of $34 million from the resolution of a contractual agreement.
income tax expense the effective income tax rate was 23 percent in 2015, 25 percent in 2014, and 23 percent in 2013. the effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year due to the allocation of the company's taxable earnings among jurisdictions, as well as certain discrete factors and events in each year, including acquisitions and
| 2015 form
collaborations. the effective income tax rate in 2015 included a tax benefit of $103 million from a reduction of state valuation allowances. the effective income tax rate in 2014 included state valuation allowances of $129 million and additional expenses of $129 million related to the branded prescription drug fee, which is non-deductible.
financial position, liquidity and capital resources
operating activities                    $7,535            $3,549          $6,267
investing activities                    $(12,936      )   $(926       )   $879
financing activities                    $5,752            $(3,293     )   $(3,442     )
cash flows provided by operations in 2015 was $7.5 billion compared to $3.5 billion in 2014. the increase was primarily due to improved results of operations due to revenue growth and an improvement in operating margin as well as the absence of after-tax transaction and financing-related and other costs of $1.8 billion incurred in connection with the termination of the proposed combination with shire, including net foreign exchange losses related to the settlement of undesignated forward contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows and the exit of certain foreign currency positions.
cash provided by operating activities also reflected abbvie's voluntary contributions to its main domestic defined benefit plan of $150 million and $370 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. abbvie also made a voluntary contribution of $150 million to this plan subsequent to december 31, 2015. abbvie also paid $350 million to purchase a priority review voucher from united therapeutics corporation in 2015. realized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation in 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled $61 million, $56 million, and $38 million, respectively, and were presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as an outflow within the operating section and an inflow within the financing section.
investing activities in 2015 primarily included the $11.5 billion cash consideration paid to acquire pharmacyclics in may 2015, net of cash acquired of $877 million. investing activities in 2015 also included cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments of $964 million, including a $500 million payment to calico that was accrued in 2014 due to the satisfaction of certain conditions under the r&d collaboration, $100 million related to an exclusive worldwide license agreement with c2n to develop and commercialize anti-tau antibodies for the treatment of alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders, and $130 million paid to infinity due to the achievement of a development milestone under the collaboration agreement. in 2014, cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments totaled $622 million, including $275 million paid to infinity related to a global collaboration to develop duvelisib (ipi-145), and $250 million to fund a novel r&d collaboration with calico. cash flows from investing activities in 2015 and 2014 also reflected capital expenditures and net sales (purchases) of short-term investments. capital expenditures in 2014 included the purchase of a small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing facility in singapore. abbvie incurred additional expenditures in 2015 to build a new biologics facility on the site to produce bulk drug substance for humira as well as to support abbvie's biologic pipeline.
in 2015 and 2014, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. the balance of commercial paper outstanding was $400 million and $416 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. abbvie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed. in may 2015, the company issued $16.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes with various maturities between 2018 and 2045. approximately $11.5 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of pharmacyclics and $5.0 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance the accelerated share repurchase program described below. in september 2015, abbvie entered into a three-year $2 billion term loan credit facility and a 364-day $2 billion term loan credit facility. in november
2015, abbvie drew on these term facilities and used the proceeds to refinance its $4 billion of senior notes that matured in 2015. during 2015 in connection with the acquisition of pharmacyclics, the company paid $86 million of costs relating to an $18 billion, 364-day bridge term loan credit agreement as well as $93 million of costs relating to the issuance of senior notes.
cash dividend payments totaled $3.3 billion in 2015 and $2.7 billion in 2014. on october 30, 2015, abbvie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.51 per share to $0.57 per share beginning with the dividend payable on february 16, 2016 to stockholders of record as of january 15, 2016. the timing, declaration, amount of, and payment of any dividends is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including abbvie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of abbvie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets, and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors.
in october 2014, abbvie's board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion stock repurchase program. in march 2015, the board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the existing stock repurchase program in anticipation of executing an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution in connection with the acquisition of pharmacyclics. on may 26, 2015, abbvie entered into and executed a $5.0 billion asr with morgan stanley & co. llc (morgan stanley). pursuant to the terms of the asr, morgan stanley made an initial delivery of approximately 68 million shares of abbvie's common stock on may 27, 2015, which represented approximately 90 percent of the total shares expected to be delivered under the asr. subsequently in 2015, morgan stanley delivered an additional 5 million shares of abbvie's common stock to abbvie in final settlement of the asr. abbvie recorded the aggregate $5.0 billion purchase price as a reduction to stockholders' equity.
in addition to the asr, the company repurchased approximately 46 million shares for $2.8 billion in the open market in 2015 and approximately 9 million shares for $550 million in the open market in 2014. abbvie settled $300 million of its 2015 open market purchases in 2016. purchases of abbvie shares under this program may be made from time to time at management's discretion. the program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. abbvie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $1.9 billion as of december 31, 2015. refer to note 12 for additional information related to the asr.
cash and equivalents in 2015 and 2014 were also negatively impacted by net unfavorable exchange rate changes totaling $300 million and $577 million, respectively, principally due to the weakening of the euro and other foreign currencies on the translation of the company's euro-denominated assets and cash denominated in foreign currencies. in 2014, abbvie had an increased concentration of cash denominated in foreign currencies accumulated in anticipation of the terminated proposed combination with shire. while a significant portion of cash and equivalents at december 31, 2015 are considered reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries, abbvie does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources. if these funds were needed for operations in the united states, abbvie would be required to accrue and pay u.s. income taxes to repatriate these funds. abbvie believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to support its assumption that the disclosed amount of undistributed earnings at december 31, 2015 has been reinvested indefinitely.
credit risk abbvie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers, and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. abbvie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. abbvie establishes an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected. abbvie also monitors the potential for and periodically has utilized factoring
| 2015 form
arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a material amount of total outstanding receivables.
abbvie continues to do business with foreign governments in certain countries, including greece, portugal, italy, and spain, that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions. substantially all of abbvie's trade receivables in greece, portugal, italy, and spain are with governmental health systems. abbvie continues to monitor the economic health of the economy in southern europe, as heightened economic concerns still exist. outstanding net governmental receivables in these countries at december 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:
italy          211           176           4           16
the company also continues to do business with foreign governments in certain oil-exporting countries, which have experienced a deterioration in economic conditions, including venezuela and saudi arabia. outstanding net governmental receivables related to saudi arabia were $108 million as of december 31, 2015. refer to item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskforeign currency risk" for additional disclosures related to venezuela. due to the decline in the price of oil, liquidity issues in certain countries may result in delays in the collection of receivables. global economic conditions and customer-specific factors may require the company to re-evaluate the collectability of its receivables and the company could potentially incur credit losses.
currently, abbvie does not believe the economic conditions in southern europe and oil-exporting countries will have a material impact on the company's liquidity, cash flow or financial flexibility. however, if government funding were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse changes in their reimbursement practices were to occur, abbvie may not be able to collect the entire balance outstanding as of december 31, 2015.
credit facility, access to capital and credit ratings credit facility abbvie currently has a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility, which matures in october 2019. the revolving credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. at december 31, 2015, the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants. commitment fees under the credit facility were not material. there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility as of december 31, 2015 and 2014.
access to capital the company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations, or by issuing additional debt. the company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt, or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. at the current time, the company
believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements, and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives.
credit ratings on april 7, 2015, following the announcement of the then proposed combination with pharmacyclics, moody's investor service confirmed its baa1 senior unsecured long-term rating and prime-2 short-term rating and revised its ratings outlook to "negative" from "stable". on march 5, 2015, standard & poor's rating services (s&p) affirmed abbvie's "a" corporate credit rating and senior unsecured debt rating and its "a-1" commercial paper rating and revised its ratings outlook to "negative" from "stable". there were no additional changes in the company's credit ratings in 2015.
unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company's ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company's outstanding debt.

includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt securities and capital lease obligations. interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using interest rates in effect at the end of 2015. projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. the projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at december 31, 2015. refer to notes 9 and 10 for further discussion regarding the company's debt instruments and related interest rate agreements outstanding at december 31, 2015. annual interest on capital lease obligations is not material.
includes the company's significant unconditional purchase obligations. these commitments do not exceed the company's projected requirements and are made in the normal course of business.
amounts less than one year includes a voluntary contribution of $150 million abbvie made to its main domestic defined benefit plan subsequent to december 31, 2015. amounts otherwise exclude pension and other post-employment benefits and related deferred compensation cash outflows. timing of funding is uncertain and dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns, changes in laws and regulations, and other variables. also included in this amount are components of other long-term liabilities including restructuring. refer to notes 8 and 11 for further information.
abbvie enters into r&d collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. individually, these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting
| 2015 form
period. however, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. from a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from product sales. it is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. as a result, these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations. refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these collaboration arrangements.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. a summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. actual results may vary from these estimates.
revenue recognition abbvie recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured. revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer.
rebates abbvie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and other government agencies and private entities.
rebate and chargeback accruals are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. rebates and chargebacks totaled $8.6 billion, $5.9 billion and $4.9 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. for each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant.
in order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. to estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. the company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. abbvie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings.
the following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances, which comprise approximately 90 percent of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks charged against
revenues in 2015. remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings.
provisions                                1,028       846                     2,362
provisions                                1,015       970                     2,825
provisions                                1,716             2,215             3,866
cash discounts and product returns allowances for cash discounts and product returns, which totaled $898 million, $610 million and $748 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold. the reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience.
pension and other post-employment benefits abbvie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the plans that are direct obligations of abbvie. the valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. the significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and the health care cost trend rates. the significant assumptions used in determining these calculations are disclosed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
the discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at december 31 each year. abbvie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. the yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. the yield curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e., duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve. beginning in 2016, abbvie will also reflect the plans' specific cash flows and apply them to the specific spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. for other countries, abbvie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. abbvie's assumed discount rate has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of december 31, 2015, and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2016. a 50 basis
| 2015 form
point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on abbvie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2016 and projected benefit obligations as of december 31, 2015:
defined benefit plans service cost and interest cost       $(45      )       $51
projected benefit obligation         $(409     )      $461
projected benefit obligation         $(46      )       $52
effective december 31, 2015, abbvie elected to change the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for the abbvie pension plan and its primary other post-employment benefit plan in the united states as well as certain international defined benefit plans and other post-employment benefit plans. based on current economic conditions, this change is expected to reduce abbvie's net periodic benefit cost by approximately $41 million in 2016 as a result of this change. refer to note 11 for further information regarding this change.
the expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance, and the current view of expected future returns. abbvie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. the current long-term rate of return on plan assets is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. abbvie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of december 31, 2015 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2016. a 1 percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have increased or decreased the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2016 by $45 million.
the health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. the current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of the plan. assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of december 31, 2015 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2016. a 1 percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on abbvie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2016 and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31, 2015:
projected benefit obligation         $114          $(90      )
income taxes abbvie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. provisions for federal, state, and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. a valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
litigation the company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. refer to note 14 for further information. loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. accordingly, abbvie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. as information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected.
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets abbvie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that abbvie records at fair value. transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry, and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values, and market participants. each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. ipr&d acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life. ipr&d acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life.
abbvie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to ipr&d, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, the overall financial performance, and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. abbvie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets using a quantitative impairment test.
for its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, foreign currency exchange rates, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings, and other assumptions and estimates. the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views of a company and similar companies. the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets, and potentially result in different impacts to the company's results of operations. actual results may differ from the company's estimates.

recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update (asu) no. 2014-09,  summary and amendments that create revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) and other assets and deferred costscontracts with customers (subtopic 340-40). the amendments in asu 2014-09 supersede most current revenue recognition requirements. the core principal of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. abbvie can apply the amendments using one of the following two methods: (i) retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or (ii) modified retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendments recognized at the date of initial application. in july 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-4, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): deferral of the effective date, which deferred the effective date of asu 2014-09 by one year for all entities. accordingly, asu 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. early application is permitted only for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. abbvie is currently assessing the timing of its adoption and the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and the implementation approach to be used.
in april 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-03, interestimputation of interest (subtopic 835-30): simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. the amendments in asu 2015-03 require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. this standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted on a retrospective basis. abbvie elected to early adopt this new standard, effective in the three months ended june 30, 2015. as a result, abbvie reclassified approximately $7 million and $27 million of net deferred financing costs as of december 31, 2014 that were previously classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets and other long-term assets, respectively, to long-term debt and lease obligations (current and non-current). total debt issuance costs classified as a reduction of long-term debt and lease obligations (current and non-current) were $117 million as of december 31, 2015.
in september 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-16, business combinations (topic 805): simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments. this standard requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. entities are currently required to retrospectively apply adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. the guidance is to be applied prospectively to measurement period adjustments that occur after the effective date of the guidance with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. abbvie elected to early adopt the standard, effective in the year ended december 31, 2015. the impact of this adoption was not material.
in november 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-17, income taxes (topic 740): balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. the standard requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. entities are currently required to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. the amendments, which require non-current presentation only (by jurisdiction), are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016 with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. the guidance is to be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. abbvie elected to early adopt this standard on a prospective basis, effective as of december 31, 2015 in order to simplify the presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted.
in january 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-01, financial instrumentsoverall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. the standard requires several targeted changes including that equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. the new guidance also changes certain disclosure requirements and other aspects of current us gaap. amendments are to be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. this standard is effective for fiscal years starting after december 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. the standard does not permit early adoption with the exception of certain targeted provisions. abbvie is currently assessing the impact and timing of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

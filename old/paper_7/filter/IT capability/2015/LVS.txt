item 7. - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the audited consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto and other financial information included in this form 10-k. certain statements in this "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" are forward-looking statements. see "- special note regarding forward-looking statements."
operations we view each of our integrated resort properties as an operating segment. our macao operating segments consist of the venetian macao, sands cotai central, four seasons macao, sands macao and other ancillary operations that support these properties. our singapore operating segment consists of the marina bay sands. our operating segments in the u.s. consist of the venetian las vegas, the palazzo and sands bethlehem. the venetian las vegas and the palazzo operating segments are managed as a single integrated resort and have been aggregated into our las vegas operating properties, considering their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, types of services and products, the regulatory business environment of the operations within each segment and the company's organizational and management reporting structure. for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, gross revenue at our reportable segments was derived as follows:
•   at the venetian macao, approximately 80.8% and 84.2%, respectively, was from gaming activities, with the remainder from room, mall, food and beverage and other non-gaming sources.
•   at sands cotai central, approximately 80.3% and 83.9%, respectively, was from gaming activities, with the remainder primarily from room and food and beverage operations.
•   at four seasons macao, approximately 72.6% and 81.5%, respectively, was from gaming activities, with the remainder primarily from mall and room operations.
•   at sands macao, approximately 92.8% and 94.0%, respectively, was from gaming activities, with the remainder primarily from food and beverage operations.
•   at marina bay sands, approximately 73.9% and 75.2%, respectively, was from gaming activities, with the remainder from room, food and beverage, mall and other non-gaming sources.
•   at our las vegas operating properties, approximately 71.6% and 67.6%, respectively, was from room, food and beverage and other non-gaming sources, with the remainder from gaming activities. the percentage of
non-gaming revenue reflects the integrated resort's emphasis on the group convention and trade show business and the resulting high occupancy and room rates throughout the week, including during mid-week periods.
•   at sands bethlehem, approximately 88.3% and 88.2%, respectively, was from gaming activities, with the remainder primarily from food and beverage and other non-gaming sources.

key operating revenue measurements operating revenues at the venetian macao, sands cotai central, four seasons macao, marina bay sands and our las vegas operating properties are dependent upon the volume of customers who stay at the hotel, which affects the price that can be charged for hotel rooms and our gaming volume. operating revenues at sands macao and sands bethlehem are principally driven by casino customers who visit the properties on a daily basis.
casino revenue measurements for macao and singapore: macao and singapore table games are segregated into two groups, consistent with the macao and singapore markets' convention: rolling chip play (all vip players) and non-rolling chip play (mostly non-vip players). the volume measurement for rolling chip play is non-negotiable gaming chips wagered and lost. the volume measurement for non-rolling chip play is table games drop ("drop"), which is the sum of markers issued (credit instruments), cash deposited in the table drop box and gaming chips purchased at the cage. rolling chip and non-rolling chip volume measurements are not comparable as the amounts wagered and lost are substantially higher than the amounts dropped. slot handle ("handle"), also a volume measurement, is the gross amount wagered for the period cited.
we view rolling chip win as a percentage of rolling chip volume, non-rolling chip win as a percentage of drop and slot hold as a percentage of slot handle. win or hold percentage represents the percentage of rolling chip volume, non-rolling chip drop or slot handle that is won by the casino and recorded as casino revenue. based upon our mix of table games, our rolling chip win percentage (calculated before discounts and commissions) is expected
to be 2.7% to 3.0%. generally, slot machine play is conducted on a cash basis. in macao and singapore, 23.1% and 33.1%, respectively, of our table games play was conducted on a credit basis for the year ended december 31, 2015.
casino revenue measurements for the u.s.: the volume measurements in the u.s. are slot handle, as previously described, and table games drop which is the total amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in the table drop box. we view table games win as a percentage of drop and slot hold as a percentage of handle. based upon our mix of table games, our table games are expected to produce a win percentage (calculated before discounts) of 21% to 29% for baccarat and 16% to 20% for non-baccarat. as in macao and singapore, slot machine play is generally conducted on a cash basis. approximately 67.4% of our table games play at our las vegas operating properties, for the year ended december 31, 2015, was conducted on a credit basis, while our table games play in pennsylvania is primarily conducted on a cash basis.
hotel revenue measurements: performance indicators used are occupancy rate, which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period, and average daily room rate, which is the average price of occupied rooms per day. the calculations of the hotel occupancy and average daily room rates include the impact of rooms provided on a complimentary basis. complimentary room rates are determined based on an analysis of retail (or cash) room rates by customer segment and type of room product to ensure the complimentary room rates are consistent with retail rates. revenue per available room represents a summary of hotel average daily room rates and occupancy. because not all available rooms are occupied, average daily room rates are normally higher than revenue per available room. reserved rooms where the guests do not show up for their stay and lose their deposit may be re-sold to walk-in guests. these rooms are considered to be occupied twice for statistical purposes due to obtaining the original deposit and the walk-in guest revenue. in cases where a significant number of rooms are resold, occupancy rates may be in excess of 100% and revenue per available room may be higher than the average daily room rate.
mall revenue measurements: occupancy, base rent per square foot and tenant sales per square foot are used as performance indicators. occupancy represents gross leasable occupied area ("gloa") divided by gross leasable area ("gla") at the end of the reporting period. gloa is the sum of: (1) tenant occupied space under lease and (2) tenants no longer occupying space, but paying rent. gla does not include space that is currently under development or not on the market for lease. base rent per square foot is the weighted average base, or minimum, rent charge in effect at the end of the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in occupancy. tenant sales per square foot is the sum of reported comparable sales for the trailing 12 months divided by the comparable square footage for the same period. only tenants that have been open for a minimum of 12 months are included in the tenant sales per square foot calculation.
2015                                                 2014                              percent change
consolidated net revenues were $11.69 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015, a decrease of $2.90 billion compared to $14.58 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease in net revenues was driven by decreases of $2.72 billion at our macao operating properties and $261.8 million at marina bay sands, primarily due to decreased casino revenues.
casino revenues decreased $2.92 billion compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease of $2.65 billion at our macao operating properties, driven by a decrease in rolling chip volume as demand has decreased in the vip market, and a $259.4 million decrease at marina bay sands, driven by a decrease in rolling chip win percentage. the following table summarizes the results of our casino activity:
2015                                                                      2014                  change
in our experience, average win percentages remain steady when measured over extended periods of time, but can vary considerably within shorter time periods as a result of the statistical variances that are associated with games of chance in which large amounts are wagered.
room revenues decreased $70.5 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease is primarily due to decreases of $100.2 million at our macao operating properties and $24.6 million at marina bay sands, driven by decreased occupancy and average daily room rates, partially offset by a $52.5 million increase at our las vegas operating properties, driven by increased occupancy and average daily room rates. the suites at sands macao are primarily provided to casino patrons on a complimentary basis. the following table summarizes the results of our room activity:
2015                                                                 2014                 change
property visitation, partially offset by a $29.6 million increase at our las vegas operating properties, driven by an increase in banquet operations.
mall revenues increased $10.8 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily due to a $16.4 million increase at our macao operating properties, driven by an increase in base rents. for further information related to the financial performance of our malls, see"- additional information regarding our retail mall operations." the following table summarizes the results of our mall activity:

operating expenses were $8.85 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015, a decrease of $1.64 billion compared to $10.48 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a decrease in casino expenses at our macao operating properties.
casino expenses decreased $1.59 billion compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. of the decrease, $1.31 billion was due to the 39% gross win tax on decreased casino revenues at our macao operating properties. the remaining decrease is primarily attributable to decreases in junket commissions, as well as the implementation of certain cost control measures at our macao operating properties.
the provision for doubtful accounts was $155.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $186.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease was driven by the overall decrease in casino receivables at our macao operating properties due to decreases in vip play and junket activity. the amount of this provision can vary over short periods of time because of factors specific to the customers who owe us money from gaming activities at any given time. we believe that the amount of our provision for doubtful accounts in the future will depend upon the state of the economy, our credit standards, our risk assessments and the judgment of our employees responsible for granting credit.
pre-opening expenses were $47.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $26.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. pre-opening expense represents personnel and other costs incurred prior to the opening of new ventures, which are expensed as incurred. pre-opening expenses for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, were primarily related to activities at the parisian macao and sands cotai central, respectively. development expenses include the costs associated with the company's evaluation and pursuit of new business opportunities, which are also expensed as incurred.
loss on disposal of assets was $35.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $6.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the loss for the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily related to dispositions at our macao operating properties.
adjusted property ebitda adjusted property ebitda, which is a non-gaap financial measure, is used by management as the primary measure of the operating performance of our segments. adjusted property ebitda is net income before intersegment royalty fees, stock-based compensation expense, corporate expense, pre-opening expense, development expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of leasehold interests in land, loss on disposal of assets, interest, other income, loss on modification or early retirement of debt and income taxes. the following table summarizes information related to our segments (see "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 17 - segment information" for discussion of our operating segments and a reconciliation of adjusted property ebitda to net income):

adjusted property ebitda at our macao operations decreased $1.04 billion compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. as previously described, the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in casino operations, driven by decreased demand in the vip market.
adjusted property ebitda at marina bay sands decreased $216.7 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. as previously described, the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in casino operations, as well as a $90.1 million tax refund received in december 2014 related to the settlement of taxes assessed and paid for the years 2010 through 2014.
adjusted property ebitda at our las vegas operating properties decreased $8.4 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in casino operations, partially offset by increases in our non-gaming operations, primarily rooms and food and beverage.
adjusted property ebitda at sands bethlehem increased $15.4 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily due to a $44.9 million increase in net revenues, driven by an increase in casino revenues, partially offset by an increase in the associated operating expenses.

interest cost increased $9.2 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, resulting from a slight increase in our weighted average interest rate, partially offset by a decrease in our weighted average debt balance. capitalized interest increased $18.2 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily related to the construction of the parisian macao.
other factors effecting earnings other income was $30.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $2.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the amounts in both periods were primarily due to foreign exchange gains.
the loss on modification or early retirement of debt was $19.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, and was primarily due to an $18.0 million loss related to the amendment of our 2011 vml credit facility in march 2014 (see "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 8 - long-term debt - 2011 vml credit facility").
our effective income tax rate was 9.0% for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to 6.4% for the year ended december 31, 2014. the effective income tax rates reflect a 17% statutory tax rate on our singapore operations and a zero percent tax rate on profits generated by our macao gaming operations due to our income tax exemption in macao, which expires at the end of 2018. we have recorded a valuation allowance related to certain deferred tax assets generated by operations in the u.s. and certain foreign jurisdictions; however, to the extent that the financial results of these operations improve and it becomes "more-likely-than-not" that these deferred tax assets or a portion thereof are realizable, we will reduce the valuation allowances in the period such determination is made.
the net income attributable to our noncontrolling interests was $419.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $747.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. these amounts are primarily related to the noncontrolling interest of scl.

casino revenues increased $617.4 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, despite the challenges in the vip market. the increase is primarily due to an increase of $474.9 million at our macao operating properties, which were driven by increases in non-rolling chip drop, partially offset by decreases in rolling chip volume due to decreased demand in the vip market. the following table summarizes the results of our casino activity:
2014                                                                      2013                  change

the loss on modification or early retirement of debt was $19.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, and was primarily due to an $18.0 million loss related to the amendment of our 2011 vml credit facility in march 2014 (see "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 8 - long-term debt - 2011 vml credit facility").
our effective income tax rate was 6.4% for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to 6.0% for the year ended december 31, 2013. the effective income tax rates reflect a 17% statutory tax rate on our singapore operations and a zero percent tax rate on profits generated by our macao gaming operations due to our income tax exemption in macao, which was extended in october 2013 through the end of 2018. we have recorded a valuation allowance related to certain deferred tax assets generated by operations in the u.s. and certain foreign jurisdictions; however, to the extent that the financial results of these operations improve and it becomes "more-likely-than-not" that these deferred tax assets or a portion thereof are realizable, we will reduce the valuation allowances in the period such determination is made.
the net income attributable to our noncontrolling interests was $747.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to $648.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. these amounts are primarily related to the noncontrolling interest of scl.

(1)   revenues from cam, levies and direct recoveries are included in minimum rents for the outlets at sands bethlehem.
(3)   mall-related expenses consist of cam, marketing fees and other direct operating expenses, property taxes and provision for (recovery of) doubtful accounts, but excludes depreciation and amortization and general and administrative costs.
(4)   commercial property that generates rental income is exempt from property tax for the first six years for newly constructed buildings in cotai. this property tax exemption expired in august 2013 for the venetian macao. in may 2014, the company received an additional six-year property tax exemption for the venetian macao. as a result, during the year ended december 31, 2014, the company reversed $2.6 million of previously recognized property taxes for the venetian macao. additionally, as previously described, marina bay sands received a $90.1 million property tax refund in december 2014, of which $9.0 million related to the mall.
it is common in the mall operating industry for companies to disclose mall net operating income ("noi") as a useful supplemental measure of a mall's operating performance. because noi excludes general and administrative expenses, interest expense, impairment losses, depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, allocations to noncontrolling interests and provision for income taxes, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate properties and the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.
in the tables above, we believe that taking total mall revenues less mall-related expenses provides an operating performance measure for our malls. other mall operating companies may use different methodologies for deriving mall-related expenses. as such, this calculation may not be comparable to the noi of other mall operating companies.
development projects macao we are constructing the parisian macao, an integrated resort that will be connected to the venetian macao and four seasons macao. the parisian macao is intended to include a gaming area (to be operated under our gaming subconcession), a hotel with approximately 3,000 rooms and suites and retail, entertainment, dining and meeting facilities. we expect the cost to design, develop and construct the parisian macao will be approximately $2.7 billion, inclusive of payments made for the land premium. as with projects of this nature, we will continue to analyze options for both a full and phased opening of the facility, which is anticipated to open in the second half of 2016, subject to macao government approval. we have capitalized costs of $1.65 billion, including the land premium (net of amortization), as of december 31, 2015. in addition, we will be completing the development of some open areas surrounding our cotai strip properties.
as of december 31, 2015, we have capitalized an aggregate of $11.14 billion in construction costs and land premiums (net of amortization) for our cotai strip developments, which include the venetian macao, sands cotai central, four seasons macao and the parisian macao, as well as our investments in transportation infrastructure, including our passenger ferry service operations.
land concessions in macao generally have an initial term of 25 years with automatic extensions of 10 years thereafter in accordance with macao law. we have received land concessions from the macao government to build on the sites on which the venetian macao, sands cotai central, four seasons macao and the parisian macao are located. we do not own these land sites in macao; however, the land concessions grant us exclusive use of the land. as specified in the land concessions, we are required to pay premiums for each parcel, which are either payable in a single lump sum upon acceptance of the land concessions by the macao government or in seven semi-annual installments, as well as annual rent for the term of the land concessions.
under our land concession for the parisian macao, we are required to complete the development by november 2016. the land concession for sands cotai central contains a similar requirement that the development be completed by december 2016. should we determine that we are unable to complete the parisian macao or sands cotai central by their respective deadlines, we would then expect to apply for another extension from the macao government. if we
are unable to meet the current deadlines and the deadlines for either development are not extended, we could lose our land concessions for the parisian macao or sands cotai central, which would prohibit us from operating any facilities developed under the respective land concessions. as a result, we could record a charge for all or some portion of the $1.65 billion or $4.87 billion in capitalized construction costs and land premiums (net of amortization), as of december 31, 2015, related to the parisian macao and sands cotai central, respectively.
united states we were constructing the las vegas condo tower, located on the las vegas strip between the palazzo and the venetian las vegas. we suspended our construction activities for the project due to reduced demand for las vegas strip condominiums and the overall decline in general economic conditions. we are evaluating the highest return opportunity for the project and intend to recommence construction when demand and conditions improve. the impact of the suspension on the estimated overall cost of the project is currently not determinable with certainty. should demand and conditions fail to improve or management decides to abandon the project, we could record a charge for some portion of the $178.6 million in capitalized construction costs as of december 31, 2015.
other we continue to aggressively pursue new development opportunities globally.

cash flows - operating activities table games play at our properties is conducted on a cash and credit basis. slot machine play is primarily conducted on a cash basis. the retail hotel rooms business is generally conducted on a cash basis, the group hotel rooms business is conducted on a cash and credit basis, and banquet business is conducted primarily on a credit basis resulting in operating cash flows being generally affected by changes in operating income and accounts receivable. for the year ended december 31, 2015, net cash generated from operating activities decreased $1.38 billion compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in operating cash flows generated from our macao operating properties. for the year ended december 31, 2014, net cash generated from operating activities increased $393.4 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in operating cash flows generated from our macao operating properties and marina bay sands.
cash flows - investing activities capital expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2015, totaled $1.53 billion, including $1.29 billion for construction and development activities in macao, which consisted primarily of $766.7 million for the parisian macao and $403.1 million for sands cotai central; $129.7 million in singapore; $77.6 million at our las vegas operating properties; and $28.6 million for corporate and other activities.
capital expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2014, totaled $1.18 billion, including $946.1 million for construction and development activities in macao, which consisted primarily of $390.6 million for the parisian macao and $345.7 million for sands cotai central; $108.7 million at our las vegas operating properties; $79.6 million in singapore; and $44.3 million for corporate and other activities.

cash flows - financing activities net cash flows used in financing activities were $3.21 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015, which was primarily attributable to $2.69 billion in dividend payments, a net repayment of $412.5 million on our 2013 u.s. credit facility and $205.1 million in common stock repurchases, partially offset by net proceeds of $179.1 million on our 2011 vml credit facility.
net cash flows used in financing activities were $3.72 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014, which was primarily attributable to $2.39 billion in dividend payments and $1.68 billion in common stock repurchases, partially offset by net proceeds of $430.0 million from our 2013 u.s. revolving facility.
net cash flows used in financing activities were $2.43 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013, which was primarily attributable to $1.56 billion in dividend payments, $561.2 million in common stock repurchases and repayments of $430.5 million on our 2012 singapore credit facility.
as of december 31, 2015, we had $2.97 billion available for borrowing under our u.s., macao and singapore credit facilities, net of letters of credit.
capital financing overview through december 31, 2015, we have funded our development projects primarily through borrowings from our credit facilities (see "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 8 - long-term debt"), operating cash flows, proceeds from our equity offerings and proceeds from the disposition of non-core assets.
our u.s., macao and singapore credit facilities contain various financial covenants. the u.s. credit facility, requires our las vegas operations to comply with a financial covenant at the end of each quarter to the extent that any
revolving loans or certain letters of credit are outstanding. this financial covenant requires our las vegas operations to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of net debt, as defined, to trailing twelve-month adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined ("adjusted ebitda"). the maximum leverage ratio is 5.5x for all quarterly periods through maturity. we can elect to contribute cash on hand to our las vegas operations on a bi-quarterly basis; such contributions having the effect of increasing adjusted ebitda during the applicable quarter for purposes of calculating compliance with the maximum leverage ratio. our macao credit facility, as amended, also requires our macao operations to comply with similar financial covenants, including maintaining a maximum leverage ratio of debt to adjusted ebitda. the maximum leverage ratio is 4.0x for the quarterly periods ending december 31, 2015 through march 31, 2017, and then decreases to, and remains at, 3.5x for all quarterly periods thereafter through maturity. our singapore credit facility, as amended, requires our marina bay sands operations to comply with similar financial covenants, including maintaining a maximum leverage ratio of debt to adjusted ebitda. the maximum leverage ratio is 3.5x for the quarterly periods ending december 31, 2015 through september 30, 2019, and then decreases to, and remains at, 3.0x for all quarterly periods thereafter through maturity. as of december 31, 2015, our u.s., macao and singapore leverage ratios were 0.9x, 1.5x and 2.3x, respectively, compared to the maximum leverage ratios allowed of 5.5x, 4.0x and 3.5x, respectively. if we are unable to maintain compliance with the financial covenants under these credit facilities, we would be in default under the respective credit facilities. a default under the u.s. credit facility would trigger a cross-default under our airplane financings. any defaults or cross-defaults under these agreements would allow the lenders, in each case, to exercise their rights and remedies as defined under their respective agreements. if the lenders were to exercise their rights to accelerate the due dates of the indebtedness outstanding, there can be no assurance that we would be able to repay or refinance any amounts that may become due and payable under such agreements, which could force us to restructure or alter our operations or debt obligations.
we held unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.18 billion and restricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately $7.9 million as of december 31, 2015, of which approximately $1.70 billion of the unrestricted amount is held by non-u.s. subsidiaries. of the $1.70 billion, approximately $1.32 billion is available to be repatriated to the u.s. with minimal taxes owed on such amounts due to the significant foreign taxes we paid, which would ultimately generate u.s. foreign tax credits if cash is repatriated. the remaining unrestricted amounts are not available for repatriation primarily due to dividend requirements to third party public shareholders in the case of funds being repatriated from scl. we believe the cash on hand and cash flow generated from operations will be sufficient to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facilities. we may elect to arrange additional financing to fund the balance of our cotai strip developments. in the normal course of our activities, we will continue to evaluate our capital structure and opportunities for enhancements thereof.
in april 2015, we entered into a joinder agreement (the "joinder agreement") to the 2011 vml credit facility. under the joinder agreement, certain lenders agreed to provide term loan commitments of $1.0 billion (the "2011 vml accordion term"), which was funded on april 30, 2015 (see "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 8 - long-term debt - 2011 vml credit facility"). during the year ended december 31, 2015, we made repayments of $820.2 million on our 2011 vml revolving facility and net repayments of $390.0 million on our 2013 u.s. revolving facility.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per common share and recorded $2.07 billion as a distribution against retained earnings. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per common share and recorded $1.61 billion as a distribution against retained earnings. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per common share and recorded $1.15 billion as a distribution against retained earnings. in january 2016, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of
in june 2013, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program with an initial authorization of $2.0 billion, which expired in june 2015, but was substantially completed during the year ended december 31, 2014. in october 2014, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock, which expires in october 2016. repurchases of our common stock are made at our discretion in accordance with applicable federal securities laws in the open market or otherwise. the timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including our financial position, earnings, legal requirements, other investment opportunities and market conditions. during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we repurchased 4,383,793, 22,406,655 and 8,570,281 shares, respectively, of our common stock for $205.1 million, $1.66 billion and $570.5 million, respectively, (including commissions) under this program. all share repurchases of our common stock have been recorded as treasury stock.

(2)   in july 2009, we entered into a capital lease agreement with our current heating, ventilation and air conditioning ("hvac") provider (the "hvac equipment lease") to provide the operation and maintenance services for the hvac equipment in las vegas. the lease has a 10-year term with a purchase option at the third, fifth, seventh
and tenth anniversary dates. we are obligated under the agreement to make monthly payments of approximately $300,000 for the first year with automatic decreases of approximately $14,000 per month on every anniversary date. the hvac equipment lease has been capitalized at the present value of the future minimum lease payments at lease inception.

(4)   we are party to a tenant lease termination and asset purchase agreement. under the agreement for the grand canal shoppes sale, we are obligated to fulfill the lease termination and asset purchase agreement.
(5)   we are party to employment agreements with six of our executive officers, with remaining terms of approximately one to five years.
(6)   we are party to long-term land leases of 25 years with automatic extensions at our option of 10 years thereafter in accordance with macao law.
(7)   we are party to certain leaseback agreements for the theater, gondola and retail space related to the sales of the grand canal shoppes and the shoppes at the palazzo.
(8)   in addition to the 39% gross gaming win tax in macao (which is not included in this table as the amount we pay is variable in nature), we are required to pay an annual premium with a fixed portion and a variable portion, which is based on the number and type of gaming tables and gaming machines we operate. based on the gaming tables and gaming machines in operation as of december 31, 2015, the annual premium payable to the macao government is approximately $39.6 million through the termination of the gaming subconcession in june 2022.
(9)   we are party to a 99-year lease agreement (88 years remaining) for a parking structure located adjacent to the venetian las vegas.
(10)   we are party to certain operating leases for real estate, various equipment and service arrangements.
(11)   as of december 31, 2015, we had a $3.0 million liability related to unrecognized tax benefits; we do not expect this liability to result in a payment of cash within the next 12 months. we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the liability in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions; therefore, such amounts are not included in the table.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities, nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions other than interest rate caps and foreign currency contracts.
restrictions on distributions we are a parent company with limited business operations. our main asset is the stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries. the debt instruments of our u.s., macao and singapore subsidiaries contain certain restrictions that, among other things, limit the ability of certain subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, issue disqualified stock or equity interests, pay dividends or make other distributions, repurchase equity interests or certain indebtedness, create certain liens, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, enter into certain mergers or consolidations or sell our assets of our company without prior approval of the lenders or noteholders.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. these estimates and judgments are based on historical information, information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could vary from those estimates and we may change our estimates and assumptions in future evaluations. changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. we believe that the critical accounting policies discussed below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
allowance for doubtful casino accounts we maintain an allowance, or reserve, for doubtful casino accounts at our operating casino resorts in macao, singapore and the u.s., which we regularly evaluate. we specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over a specified dollar amount, based upon the age of the account, the customer's financial condition, collection history and any other known information, and we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under the specified dollar amount. we also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts in our evaluation of the adequacy of the recorded reserves. credit or marker play was 23.1%, 33.1% and 67.4% of table games play at our macao properties, marina bay sands and las vegas operating properties, respectively, during the year ended december 31, 2015. our allowance for doubtful casino accounts was 36.4% and 33.8% of gross casino receivables as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the credit extended to our junkets can be offset by the commissions
payable to said junkets, which is considered in the establishment of the allowance for doubtful accounts. our allowance for doubtful accounts from our hotel and other receivables is not material.
litigation accrual we are subject to various claims and legal actions. we estimate the accruals for these claims and legal actions based on all relevant facts and circumstances currently available and include such accruals in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets when it is determined that such contingencies are both probable and reasonably estimable.
property and equipment at december 31, 2015, we had net property and equipment of $15.73 billion, representing 75.0% of our total assets. we depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. the estimated useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as current operating strategy and legal considerations, such as contractual life. future events, such as property expansions, property developments, new competition, or new regulations, could result in a change in the manner in which we use certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets.
for assets to be held and used (including projects under development), fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. if an indicator of impairment exists, we first group our assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (the "asset group"). secondly, we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise from the completion, use and eventual disposition of such asset group. we estimate the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group. if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is measured based on fair value compared to carrying value, with fair value typically based on a discounted cash flow model. if an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs.
to estimate the undiscounted cash flows of our asset groups, we consider all potential cash flows scenarios, which are probability weighted based on management's estimates given current conditions. determining the recoverability of our asset groups is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including estimated cash flows, probability weighting of potential scenarios, costs to complete construction for assets under development, growth rates and future market conditions, among others. future changes to our estimates and assumptions based upon changes in macro-economic factors, regulatory environments, operating results or management's intentions may result in future changes to the recoverability of our asset groups.
for assets to be held for sale, the fixed assets (the "disposal group") are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. losses are recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down to fair value less cost to sell, while gains are recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, but not in excess of the cumulative loss previously recognized. any gains or losses not previously recognized that result from the sale of the disposal group shall be recognized at the date of sale. fixed assets are not depreciated while classified as held for sale.
capitalized interest interest costs associated with our major construction projects are capitalized and included in the cost of the projects. when no debt is incurred specifically for construction projects, we capitalize interest on amounts expended using the weighted average cost of our outstanding borrowings. capitalization of interest ceases when the project is substantially complete or construction activity is suspended for more than a brief period.
leasehold interests in land leasehold interests in land represent payments made for the use of land over an extended period of time. the leasehold interests in land are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the related lease agreements.
indefinite useful life assets as of december 31, 2015, we had a $50.0 million asset related to our sands bethlehem gaming license and a $16.5 million asset related to our sands bethlehem table games certificate, both of which were determined to have indefinite useful lives. assets with indefinite useful lives are assessed regularly to ensure they continue to meet the indefinite useful life criteria. these assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment and recoverability annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. when performing our impairment analysis, we may first conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether we believe it is "more-likely-than-not" that the asset is impaired. if we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and we determine it is "more-likely-than-not" that the asset is impaired after assessing the qualitative factors, we then perform an impairment test that consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount. if the fair value of the asset exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment is recognized. if the fair value of the asset does not exceed the carrying amount, an impairment will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference.
if a quantitative impairment test is to be performed to estimate the fair value of our intangible assets, our fair value analysis would be based on expected adjusted property ebitda, combined with estimated future tax-affected cash flows and a terminal value using the gordon growth model, which are discounted to present value at rates commensurate with our capital structure and the prevailing borrowing rates within the casino industry in general. adjusted property ebitda and discounted cash flows are common measures used to value cash-intensive businesses, such as casinos. determining the fair value of the gaming license and table games certificate is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including adjusted property ebitda, growth rates, discount rates and future market conditions, among others.
if we determine a qualitative assessment is to be performed, we assess certain qualitative factors including, but not limited to, the results of the most recent fair value calculation, operating results and projected operating results, and macro-economic and industry conditions.
future changes to our estimates and assumptions based upon changes in operating results, macro-economic factors or management's intentions may result in future changes to the fair value of the gaming license and table games certificate.
stock-based compensation accounting standards regarding share-based payments require the recognition of compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations related to the fair value of employee stock-based compensation. determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise, the associated volatility and the expected dividends. expected volatilities are based on our historical volatility. the expected option life is based on the contractual term of the option as well historical exercise and forfeiture behavior. the expected dividend yield is based on our estimate of annual dividends expected to be paid at the time of the grant. we believe that the valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the fair values of our stock options granted. judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting. if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense could be materially impacted. all employee stock options were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value (as defined in the company's equity award plans).
during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $45.8 million and $48.1 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2015, under the lvsc 2004 plan there was $33.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures of 8.0% per year, related to unvested stock options and there was $4.7 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures of 8.0% per year, related to unvested restricted stock and stock units. the stock option and restricted stock and stock unit costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.8 years and 1.1 years, respectively.
as of december 31, 2015, under the scl equity plan there was $19.3 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures of 9.5% per year, related to unvested stock options and there was $6.1 million of
unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units. the stock option and restricted stock unit costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.9 years and 1.8 years, respectively.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. (including federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. we record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. accounting standards regarding income taxes require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if based on the available evidence, it is "more-likely-than-not" that such assets will not be realized. accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting period based on a "more-likely-than-not" realization threshold. this assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring, and implementation of tax planning strategies.
we recorded a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions of $195.8 million and $215.2 million, as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets of our u.s. operations of $3.11 billion and $2.27 billion as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. management will reassess the realization of deferred tax assets based on the applicable accounting standards for income taxes each reporting period and consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, sources of taxable income and tax planning strategies. to the extent that the financial results of these operations improve and it becomes "more-likely-than-not" that the deferred tax assets are realizable, we will be able to reduce the valuation allowance in the period such determination is made.
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. during the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions for which the tax treatment is uncertain. accounting standards regarding uncertainty in income taxes provides a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is "more-likely-than-not" that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely, based solely on the technical merits, of being sustained on examinations. we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may be different.
our major tax jurisdictions are the u.s., macao, and singapore. we are subject to examination for years beginning 2010 in the u.s. and singapore and for years beginning 2011 in macao. the inland revenue authority of singapore is currently performing a compliance review of the marina bay sands tax return for tax years 2010 through 2012.

accounting matters critical accounting policies and estimates dominion has identified the following accounting policies, including certain inherent estimates, that as a result of the judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved, could result in material changes to its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions. dominion has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the audit committee of its board of directors.
accounting for regulated operations the accounting for dominions regulated electric and gas operations differs from the accounting for nonregulated operations in that dominion is required to reflect the effect of rate regulation in its consolidated financial statements. for regulated businesses subject to federal or state cost-of-service rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. when it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies are deferred as regulatory assets. likewise, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. generally, regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into income over the period authorized by the regulator.
dominion evaluates whether or not recovery of its regulatory assets through future rates is probable and makes various assumptions in its analysis. the expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions, legislation or historical experience, as well as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities and legal counsel. if recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period such assessment is made. see notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
asset retirement obligations dominion recognizes liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists and the aro can be reasonably estimated. these aros are recognized at fair value as incurred and are capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets. in the absence of quoted market prices, dominion estimates the fair value of its aros using present value techniques, in which it makes various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit-adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. the impact on measurements of new aros or remeasurements of existing aros, using different cost escalation rates in the future, may be significant. when dominion revises any assumptions used to calculate the fair value of existing aros, it adjusts the carrying amount of both the aro liability and the related long-lived asset for assets that are in service; for assets that have ceased operations, dominion adjusts the carrying amount of the aro liability with such changes recognized in income. dominion accretes the aro liability to reflect the passage of time. in 2015, dominion recorded an increase in aros of $403 million primarily related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities. see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
in 2015, 2014 and 2013, dominion recognized $93 million, $81 million and $86 million, respectively, of accretion, and expects to recognize $99 million in 2016. dominion records accretion and depreciation associated with utility nuclear decommissioning aros as an adjustment to the regulatory liability related to its nuclear decommissioning trust.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, continued a significant portion of dominions aros relates to the future decommissioning of its merchant and utility nuclear facilities. these nuclear decommissioning aros are reported in the dominion generation segment. at december 31, 2015, dominions nuclear decommissioning aros totaled $1.5 billion, representing approximately 70% of its total aros. based on their significance, the following discussion of critical assumptions inherent in determining the fair value of aros relates to those associated with dominions nuclear decommissioning obligations.
dominion obtains from third-party specialists periodic site-specific base year cost studies in order to estimate the nature, cost and timing of planned decommissioning activities for its nuclear plants. these cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time they are performed; however, estimates of future cash flows for extended periods of time are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. in addition, dominions cost estimates include cost escalation rates that are applied to the base year costs. dominion determines cost escalation rates, which represent projected cost increases over time due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities, for each nuclear facility. the selection of these cost escalation rates is dependent on subjective factors which are considered to be critical assumptions.
income taxes judgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. the interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty, since tax authorities may interpret the laws differently. ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows, and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material.
given the uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and filing of income taxes, there are standards for recognition and measurement in financial statements of positions taken or expected to be taken by an entity in its income tax returns. positions taken by an entity in its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be examined by tax authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. at december 31, 2015, dominion had $103 million of unrecognized tax benefits. changes in these unrecognized tax benefits may result from remeasurement of amounts expected to be realized, settlements with tax authorities and expiration of statutes of limitations.
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. dominion evaluates quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by considering current and historical financial results, expectations for future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets. dominion establishes a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. at december 31, 2015, dominion had established $73 million of valuation allowances.
accounting for derivative contracts and other instruments at fair value dominion uses derivative contracts such as futures, swaps, forwards, options and ftrs to manage commodity and financial market risks of its business operations. derivative contracts, with certain exceptions, are reported in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. accounting requirements for derivatives and related hedging activities are complex and may be subject to further clarification by standard-setting bodies. the majority of investments held in dominions nuclear decommissioning and rabbi and benefit plan trust funds are also subject to fair value accounting. see notes 6 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on these fair value measurements.
fair value is based on actively-quoted market prices, if available. in the absence of actively-quoted market prices, management seeks indicative price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry publications. when evaluating pricing information provided by brokers and other pricing services, dominion considers whether the broker is willing and able to trade at the quoted price, if the broker quotes are based on an active market or an inactive market and the extent to which brokers are utilizing a particular model if pricing is not readily available. if pricing information from external sources is not available, or if dominion believes that observable pricing information is not indicative of fair value, judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. in those cases, dominion must estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future price information and use of statistical methods, including regression analysis, that reflect its market assumptions.
use of estimates in goodwill impairment testing as of december 31, 2015, dominion reported $3.3 billion of goodwill in its consolidated balance sheet. a significant portion resulted from the acquisition of the former cng in 2000.
in april of each year, dominion tests its goodwill for potential impairment, and performs additional tests more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. the 2015, 2014 and 2013 annual tests and any interim tests did not result in the recognition of any goodwill impairment.
in general, dominion estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques that use multiples of earnings for peer group companies and analyses of recent business combinations involving peer group companies. fair value estimates are dependent on subjective factors such as dominions estimate of future cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates, and the selection of peer group companies and recent transactions. these underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time; subsequent modifications, particularly changes in discount rates or growth rates inherent in dominions estimates of future cash flows, could result in a future impairment of goodwill. although dominion has consistently applied the same
methods in developing the assumptions and estimates that underlie the fair value calculations, such as estimates of future cash flows, and based those estimates on relevant information available at the time, such cash flow estimates are highly uncertain by nature and may vary significantly from actual results. if the estimates of future cash flows used in the most recent tests had been 10% lower, the resulting fair values would have still been greater than the carrying values of each of those reporting units tested, indicating that no impairment was present. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
use of estimates in long-lived asset impairment testing impairment testing for an individual or group of long-lived assets or for intangible assets with definite lives is required when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. when an assets carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset, the asset is considered impaired to the extent that the assets fair value is less than its carrying amount. performing an impairment test on long-lived assets involves judgment in areas such as identifying if circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets, and developing the undiscounted and discounted estimated future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of market-based value) associated with the asset, including probability weighting such cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing, expectations about operating the long-lived assets and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. when determining whether an asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has identifiable cash flows. although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. for example, estimates of future cash flows would contemplate factors which may change over time, such as the expected use of the asset, including future production and sales levels, expected fluctuations of prices of commodities sold and consumed and expected proceeds from dispositions. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairments related to certain long-lived assets.
employee benefit plans dominion sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for eligible active employees, retirees and qualifying dependents. the projected costs of providing benefits under these plans are dependent, in part, on historical information such as employee demographics, the level of contributions made to the plans and earnings on plan assets. assumptions about the future, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates applied to benefit obligations, mortality rates and the anticipated rate of increase in healthcare costs and participant compensation, also have a significant impact on employee benefit costs. the impact of changes in these factors, as well as differences between dominions assumptions and actual experience, is generally recognized in the consolidated statements of income over the remaining average service period of plan participants, rather than immediately.
the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions. dominion determines the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans by using a combination of:
   expected future risk premiums, asset volatilities and correlations;
   investment allocation of plan assets. the strategic target asset allocation for dominions pension funds is 28% u.s. equity, 18% non-u.s. equity,
35% fixed income, 3% real estate and 16% other alternative investments, such as private equity investments.
strategic investment policies are established for dominions prefunded benefit plans based upon periodic asset/liability studies. factors considered in setting the investment policy include those mentioned above such as employee demographics, liability growth rates, future discount rates, the funded status of the plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. deviations from the plans strategic allocation are a function of dominions assessments regarding short-term risk and reward opportunities in the capital markets and/or short-term market movements which result in the plans actual asset allocations varying from the strategic target asset allocations. through periodic rebalancing, actual allocations are brought back in line with the target. future asset/liability studies will focus on strategies to further reduce pension and other postretirement plan risk, while still achieving attractive levels of returns.
dominion develops assumptions, which are then compared to the forecasts of an independent investment advisor to ensure reasonableness. an internal committee selects the final assumptions. dominion calculated its pension cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.75% for 2015 and 2014 and 8.50% for 2013. for 2016, the expected long-term rate of return for pension cost assumption is 8.75%. dominion calculated its other postretirement benefit cost using an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 8.50% for 2015 and 2014 and 7.75% for 2013. for 2016, the expected long-term rate of return for other postretirement benefit cost assumption is 8.50%. the rate used in calculating other postretirement benefit cost is lower than the rate used in calculating pension cost because of differences in the relative amounts of various types of investments held as plan assets.
dominion determines discount rates from analyses of aa/aa rated bonds with cash flows matching the expected payments to be made under its plans. the discount rates used to calculate pension cost and other postretirement benefit cost were 4.40% in 2015, ranged from 5.20% to 5.30% for pension plans and 5.00% to 5.10% for other postretirement benefit plans in 2014, and ranged from 4.40% to 4.80% in 2013. dominion selected a discount rate ranging from 4.96% to 4.99% for pension plans and ranging from 4.93% to 4.94% for other postretirement benefit plans for determining its december 31, 2015 projected benefit obligations.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, continued dominion establishes the healthcare cost trend rate assumption based on analyses of various factors including the specific provisions of its medical plans, actual cost trends experienced and projected, and demographics of plan participants. dominions healthcare cost trend rate assumption as of december 31, 2015 was 7.00% and is expected to gradually decrease to 5.00% by 2019 and continue at that rate for years thereafter.
dominion develops its mortality assumption using plan-specific studies and projects mortality improvement using scales developed by the society of actuaries.
the following table illustrates the effect on cost of changing the critical actuarial assumptions previously discussed, while holding all other assumptions constant:
increase in net periodic cost change in                      pension                                         other actuarial assumption           benefits                      postretirement benefits
in addition to the effects on cost, at december 31, 2015, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase dominions projected pension benefit obligation by $212 million and its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $40 million, while a 1.00% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase its accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $157 million.
see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on dominions employee benefit plans.
net income attributable to dominion increased by 45% primarily due to the absence of charges associated with virginia legislation enacted in april 2014 relating to the development of a third nuclear unit located at north anna and offshore wind facilities, the absence of losses related to the repositioning of dominions producer services business in the first quarter of 2014, and the absence of charges related to dominions liability manage-
ment exercise. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on legislation related to north anna and offshore wind facilities. see liquidity and capital resources for more information on the liability management exercise.
net income attributable to dominion decreased by 23% primarily due to charges associated with virginia legislation enacted in april 2014 relating to the development of a third nuclear unit located at north anna and offshore wind facilities, charges associated with dominions liability management exercise, and the repositioning of dominions producer services business, which was completed in the first quarter of 2014. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on legislation related to north anna and offshore wind facilities. see liquidity and capital resources for more information on the liability management exercise. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in investment tax credits received, primarily from new solar projects.

   the absence of losses related to the repositioning of dominions producer services business in the first quarter of 2014, reflecting the termination of natural gas trading and certain energy marketing activities ($313 million);
   a $159 million increase from electric utility operations, primarily reflecting:
   a decrease in capacity related expenses ($33 million); partially offset by
   an $85 million write-off of deferred fuel costs associated with virginia legislation enacted in february 2015;
                      a $77 million increase from merchant generation operations, primarily due to increased generation output reflecting the absence of planned outages at certain merchant generation facilities ($83 million) and additional solar generating facilities placed into service ($53 million), partially offset by lower realized prices ($58 million);
   a $61 million increase in gas transportation and storage activities, primarily due to the addition of dcg ($62 million), decreased fuel costs ($24
   a $61 million decrease from ngl activities, primarily due to decreased prices.
   the absence of charges associated with virginia legislation enacted in april 2014 relating to the development of a third nuclear unit located at north anna and offshore wind facilities ($370 million);
   a $97 million decrease in planned outage costs primarily due to a decrease in scheduled outage days at certain merchant generation facilities ($59
million) and non-nuclear utility generation facilities ($38 million); and
   a $22 million decrease in charges related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities.
   the absence of a gain on the sale of dominions electric retail energy marketing business in march 2014 ($100 million), net of a $31 million write-off of goodwill;
   an $80 million increase in certain electric transmission-related expenditures. these expenses are primarily recovered through state and ferc rates and do not impact net income;
   a $53 million increase in utility nuclear refueling outage costs primarily due to the amortization of outage costs that were previously deferred pursuant to virginia legislation enacted in april 2014;
   a $46 million net increase due to services performed for atlantic coast pipeline and blue racer. these expenses are billed to these entities and do not significantly impact net income; and
   a $22 million increase due to the acquisition of dcg.
other income decreased 22%, primarily reflecting lower tax recoveries associated with contributions in aid of construction ($17 million), a decrease in interest income related to income taxes ($12 million), and lower net realized gains on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($11 million).
interest and related charges decreased 24%, primarily as a result of the absence of charges associated with dominions liability management exercise in 2014.
   a $195 million decrease primarily related to the repositioning of dominions producer services business which was completed in the first quarter of 2014, reflecting the termination of natural gas trading and certain energy marketing activities.
   a $171 million increase from electric utility operations, primarily reflecting:
   an increase from rate adjustment clauses at electric utility operations ($132 million); and
   an increase in sales from electric utility operations primarily due to an increase in heating degree days ($34 million);
   a $46 million increase in gas transportation and storage activities and other revenues, largely due to various expansion projects being placed into service; and
   $370 million in charges associated with virginia legislation enacted in april 2014 relating to the development of a third nuclear unit located at north anna and offshore wind facilities;
   a $135 million increase in planned outage costs at certain merchant generation facilities and at certain non-nuclear utility facilities; and
   a $121 million charge related to a settlement offer to incur future ash pond closure costs at certain utility generation facilities.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, continued these increases were partially offset by:
   a gain on the sale of dominions electric retail energy marketing business in march 2014 ($100 million), net of a $31 million write-off of goodwill;
   a $67 million decrease primarily due to the deferral of utility nuclear outage costs beginning in the second quarter of 2014, pursuant to the virginia legislation enacted in april 2014;
interest and related charges increased 36%, primarily due to charges associated with dominions liability management exercise in 2014 ($284 million) and higher long-term debt interest expense resulting from debt issuances in 2014 ($44 million).
income tax expense decreased 49%, primarily reflecting lower pre-tax income ($350 million) and the impact of federal renewable energy investment tax credits ($105 million).
outlook dominions strategy is to continue focusing on its regulated businesses while maintaining upside potential in well-positioned nonregulated businesses. the goals of this strategy are to provide eps growth, a growing dividend and to maintain a stable credit profile. dominion expects 80% to 90% of earnings from its primary operating segments to come from regulated and long-term contracted businesses.
   a return to normal weather in its electric utility operations;
   growth in weather-normalized electric utility sales of approximately 1%;
   construction and operation of growth projects in electric utility operations and associated rate adjustment clause revenue;
   the absence of a write-off of deferred fuel costs associated with virginia legislation enacted in february 2015 and decreased charges related to future ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities;
   a lower effective tax rate, driven primarily by additional investment tax credits;
additionally, in 2016, dominion expects to focus on meeting new and developing environmental requirements, including by making investments in utility solar generation, particularly in virginia.

   an $85 million write-off of deferred fuel costs associated with virginia legislation enacted in february 2015;
   the absence of $370 million in charges associated with virginia legislation enacted in april 2014 relating to the development of a third nuclear unit located at north anna and offshore wind facilities; and
   a $38 million decrease in planned outage costs primarily due to a decrease in scheduled outage days at certain non-nuclear utility generation facilities.
   an $80 million increase in certain electric transmission-related expenditures. these expenses are primarily recovered through state and ferc rates and do not impact net income; and
   a $53 million increase in utility nuclear refueling outage costs primarily due to the amortization of outage costs that were previously deferred pursuant to virginia legislation enacted in april 2014.
other income decreased 27%, primarily reflecting lower tax recoveries associated with contributions in aid of construction.
   $370 million in charges associated with virginia legislation enacted in april 2014 relating to the development of a third nuclear unit located at north anna and offshore wind facilities; and
   a $121 million charge related to a settlement offer to incur future ash pond closure costs at certain generation facilities.
net income decreased by 11% primarily due to the absence of gains on the indirect sale of assets to blue racer, a decrease in income from ngl activities and higher interest expense, partially offset by increased gains from agreements to convey shale development rights underneath several natural gas storage fields.
   a $62 million decrease from ngl activities, primarily due to decreased prices; partially offset by
   a $2 million increase in gas transportation and storage activities, primarily due to decreased fuel costs ($24 million) and various expansion projects placed into service ($24 million), partially offset by decreased regulated gas sales ($46 million); and
   a $47 million net increase due to services performed for atlantic coast pipeline and blue racer. these expenses are billed to these entities and do not significantly impact net income; and
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, continued interest and related charges increased $46 million, primarily due to higher long-term debt interest expense resulting from debt issuances in december 2014.
   an increase in gains associated with assignments of marcellus acreage ($42 million); partially offset by
liquidity and capital resources dominion depends on both internal and external sources of liquidity to provide working capital and as a bridge to long-term debt financings. short-term cash requirements not met by cash provided by operations are generally satisfied with proceeds from short-term borrowings. long-term cash needs are met through issuances of debt and/or equity securities.
at december 31, 2015, dominion had $932 million of unused capacity under its credit facilities. see additional discussion below under credit facilities and short-term debt.
operating activities                                       4,475                 3,439                 3,433

operating cash flows net cash provided by dominions operating activities increased $1.0 billion, primarily due to the absence of losses related to the repositioning of dominions producer services business in 2014, higher deferred fuel cost recoveries in its virginia jurisdiction, higher revenue from rate adjustment clauses, lower outage costs and the absence of losses related to the retail electric energy marketing business in 2014.
dominion believes that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute to planned levels of capital expenditures and maintain or grow the dividend on common shares. in december 2015, dominions board of directors affirmed the dividend policy it set in february 2015 targeting a payout ratio of 70-75%, and established an annual dividend rate for 2016 of $2.80 per share of common stock, an 8.1% increase over the 2015 rate. dividends are subject to declaration by the board of directors. in january 2016, dominions board of directors declared dividends payable in march 2016 of 70 cents per share of common stock.
dominions operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact the timing or amounts of operating cash flows, and which are discussed in item 1a. risk factors.
credit risk dominions exposure to potential concentrations of credit risk results primarily from its energy marketing and price risk management activities. presented below is a summary of dominions credit exposure as of december 31, 2015 for these activities. gross credit exposure for each counterparty is calculated as outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on- or off-balance sheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights.
gross          credit           net credit      collateral        credit exposure                      exposure
(1)   designations as investment grade are based upon minimum credit ratings assigned by moodys and standard &amp; poors. the five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 45% of the total net credit exposure.
(2)   the five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 2% of the total net credit exposure.
(3)   the five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 14% of the total net credit exposure.
(4)   the five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 20% of the total net credit exposure.
investing cash flows in 2015, net cash used in dominions investing activities increased $1.3 billion, primarily due to dominions acquisition of dcg in 2015, an increase in acquisitions of solar development projects in 2015, and the absence of proceeds from the sale of dominions electric retail energy marketing business in 2014.
financing cash flows and liquidity dominion relies on capital markets as significant sources of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by cash provided by its operations. as discussed in credit ratings, dominions ability to borrow funds or issue securities and the return demanded by investors are affected by credit ratings. in addition, the raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory requirements, including registration with the sec for certain issuances.
dominion currently meets the definition of a well-known seasoned issuer under sec rules governing the registration, communications and offering processes under the securities act of 1933. the rules provide for a streamlined shelf registration
process to provide registrants with timely access to capital. this allows dominion to use automatic shelf registration statements to register any offering of securities, other than those for exchange offers or business combination transactions.
in 2015, net cash provided by dominions financing activities increased $573 million, primarily due to the issuance of common stock through an at-the-market program, proceeds from the sale of interest in merchant solar projects and the absence of subsidiary preferred stock redemption in 2014, partially offset by the absence of proceeds from the issuance of dominion midstream common units in 2014.
liability management during 2014, dominion elected to redeem certain debt and preferred securities prior to their stated maturities. proceeds from the issuance of lower-cost senior and enhanced junior subordinated notes were used to fund the redemption payments. see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for descriptions of these redemptions.
from time to time, dominion may reduce its outstanding debt and level of interest expense through redemption of debt securities prior to maturity and repurchases in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through tender offers or otherwise.
credit facilities and short-term debt dominion uses short-term debt to fund working capital requirements and as a bridge to long-term debt financings. the levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied by cash from operations. in january 2016, dominion expanded its short-term funding resources through a $1.0 billion increase to one of its joint revolving credit facility limits. in addition, dominion utilizes cash and letters of credit to fund collateral requirements. collateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels, dominions credit ratings and the credit quality of its counterparties.
in connection with commodity hedging activities, dominion is required to provide collateral to counterparties under some circumstances. under certain collateral arrangements, dominion may satisfy these requirements by electing to either deposit cash, post letters of credit or, in some cases, utilize other forms of security. from time to time, dominion may vary the form of collateral provided to counterparties after weighing the costs and benefits of various factors associated with the different forms of collateral. these factors include short-term borrowing and short-term investment rates, the spread over these short-term rates at which dominion can issue commercial paper, balance sheet impacts, the costs and fees of alternative collateral postings with these and other counterparties and overall liquidity management objectives.
dominions commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding, as well as capacity available under credit facilities, were as follows:
december 31, 2015                          facility           outstanding         outstanding                        facility limit      commercial paper         letters of credit        capacity available

facility(1)
(1)   these credit facilities mature in april 2019, and can be used to support bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper, as well as to support up to a combined
$2.0 billion of letters of credit.
(2)   in january 2016, this facility limit was increased from $4.0 billion to $5.0 billion.
(3)   the weighted-average interest rate of the outstanding commercial paper supported by dominions credit facilities was 0.62% at december 31, 2015.
in november 2015, dominion issued $400 million of private placement short-term notes that mature in may 2016 and bear interest at a variable rate. in december 2015, dominion issued an additional $200 million of the variable rate short-term notes that mature in may 2016. the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.
type                     principal      rate          maturity
in august 2015, virginia power remarketed five series of tax-exempt bonds, with an aggregate outstanding principal of $412 million to new investors. two of the bonds will bear interest at a coupon rate of 1.75% until may 2019 after which they will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time. three of the bonds will bear interest at a coupon rate of 2.15% until september 2020 after which they will bear interest at a market rate to be determined at that time. previously, interest on all of the remarketed bonds was variable and reset monthly. this remarketing was accounted for as a debt extinguishment with the previous investors.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, continued during 2015, dominion repaid and repurchased $892 million of long-term debt.
issuance of common stock and other equity securities dominion maintains dominion direct® and a number of employee savings plans through which contributions may be invested in dominions common stock. these shares may either be newly issued or purchased on the open market with proceeds contributed to these plans. in january 2014, dominion began purchasing its common stock on the open market for these plans. in april 2014, dominion began issuing new common shares for these direct stock purchase plans.
during 2015, dominion issued 4.2 million shares of common stock totaling $295 million through employee savings plans, direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plans and other employee and director benefit plans. dominion received cash proceeds of $284 million from the issuance of 4.1 million of such shares through dominion direct® and employee savings plans.
during 2015, dominion issued 6.8 million shares of common stock and received cash proceeds of $499 million, net of fees and commissions paid of $3 million, through an at-the-market program and a registered underwritten public offering. see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the at-the-market program and public offering.
repurchase of common stock dominion did not repurchase any shares in 2015 and does not plan to repurchase shares during 2016, except for shares tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested restricted stock, which does not count against its stock repurchase authorization.
purchase of dominion midstream units in september 2015, dominion initiated a program to purchase from the market up to $50 million of common units representing limited partner interests in dominion midstream. the common units may be acquired by dominion over the 12 month period following commencement of the program at the discretion of management. through december 31, 2015, dominion purchased approximately 887,000 common units for $25 million. in the first quarter of 2016, dominion purchased approximately 377,000 additional common units for approximately $10 million. at february 23, 2016, dominion still has the ability to purchase up to $15 million of common units under the program.
proposed acquisition of questar under the terms of the questar combination announced in february 2016, dominion has agreed to pay questar shareholders $25 per share, totaling approximately $4.4 billion as well as assume questars outstanding debt, currently approximately $1.6 billion, which is expected to remain outstanding following the merger. additionally, dominion entered into agreements with several of its lending banks pursuant to which they have commit-
ted to provide temporary debt financing consisting of a $3.9 billion acquisition facility. dominion intends to permanently finance the transaction in a manner that supports its existing credit ratings targets by issuing a combination of common stock, mandatory convertibles (including rsns) and debt at dominion and indirectly through an issuance of common units at dominion midstream, the proceeds of which will be applied to pay dominion for certain assets of questar, which are expected to be contributed to dominion midstream. subject to receipt of questar shareholder and any required regulatory approvals and meeting closing conditions, dominion targets closing by the end of 2016.
credit ratings credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. dominion believes that its current credit ratings provide sufficient access to the capital markets. however, disruptions in the banking and capital markets not specifically related to dominion may affect its ability to access these funding sources or cause an increase in the return required by investors. dominions credit ratings affect its liquidity, cost of borrowing under credit facilities and collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts, as well as the rates at which it is able to offer its debt securities.
both quantitative (financial strength) and qualitative (business or operating characteristics) factors are considered by the credit rating agencies in establishing an individual companys credit rating. credit ratings should be evaluated independently and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. the credit ratings for dominion are affected by its financial profile, mix of regulated and nonregulated businesses and respective cash flows, changes in methodologies used by the rating agencies and event risk, if applicable, such as major acquisitions or dispositions.
in november 2014, standard & poors changed dominions rating outlook to negative from stable. in february 2016, standard & poors lowered the following ratings for dominion: issuer to bbb+ from a-, senior unsecured debt securities to bbb from bbb+ and junior/remarketable subordinated debt securities to bbb- from bbb. in addition, standard & poors affirmed dominions commercial paper rating of a-2 and revised its outlook to stable from negative.
credit ratings as of february 23, 2016 follow:
fitch       moodys      standard &amp; poors dominion issuer                                                  bbb+         baa2                bbb+
senior unsecured debt securities                        bbb+         baa2                bbb junior/remarketable subordinated debt securities        bbb-         baa3                bbb-
as of february 23, 2016, fitch, moodys and standard & poors maintained a stable outlook for their respective ratings of dominion.
a downgrade in an individual companys credit rating does not necessarily restrict its ability to raise short-term and long-term financing as long as its credit rating remains investment grade, but it could result in an increase in the cost of borrowing. dominion works closely with fitch, moodys and standard & poors with the objective of achieving its targeted credit ratings. dominion may find it necessary to modify its business plan to maintain or achieve appropriate credit ratings and such changes may adversely affect growth and eps.
debt covenants as part of borrowing funds and issuing debt (both short-term and long-term) or preferred securities, dominion must enter into enabling agreements. these agreements contain covenants that, in the event of default, could result in the acceleration of principal and interest payments; restrictions on distributions related to capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments; and in some cases, the termination of credit commitments unless a waiver of such requirements is agreed to by the lenders/security holders. these provisions are customary, with each agreement specifying which covenants apply. these provisions are not necessarily unique to dominion.
   information requirements, including submitting financial reports filed with the sec and information about changes in dominions credit ratings to lenders;
   performance obligations, audits/inspections, continuation of the basic nature of business, restrictions on certain matters related to merger or consolidation and restrictions on disposition of all or substantially all assets;
   compliance with collateral minimums or requirements related to mortgage bonds; and
   limitations on liens.
dominion is required to pay annual commitment fees to maintain its credit facilities. in addition, dominions credit agreements contain various terms and conditions that could affect its ability to borrow under these facilities. they include maximum debt to total capital ratios and cross-default provisions.
as of december 31, 2015, the calculated total debt to total capital ratio, pursuant to the terms of the agreements, was as follows:
(1)   indebtedness as defined by the bank agreements excludes junior subordinated and remarketable subordinated notes reflected as long-term debt as well as aoci reflected as equity in the consolidated balance sheets.
if dominion or any of its material subsidiaries fails to make payment on various debt obligations in excess of $100 million, the lenders could require the defaulting company, if it is a borrower under dominions credit facilities, to accelerate its repayment of any outstanding borrowings and the lenders could terminate their commitments, if any, to lend funds to that company under the credit facilities. in addition, if the defaulting company is virginia power, dominions obligations to repay any outstanding borrowing under the credit facilities could also be accelerated and the lenders commitments to dominion could terminate.
dominion executed rccs in connection with its issuance of the following hybrid securities:
in october 2014, dominion redeemed all of the june 2009 hybrids. the redemption was conducted in compliance with the rcc. see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information, including terms of the rccs.
at december 31, 2015, the termination dates and covered debt under the rccs associated with dominions hybrids were as follows:
hybrid                   rcc                    designated covered debt under termination date       rcc june 2006 hybrids                   6/30/2036                    september 2006 hybrids september 2006 hybrids              9/30/2036                    june 2006 hybrids dominion monitors these debt covenants on a regular basis in order to ensure that events of default will not occur. as of december 31, 2015, there have been no events of default under or changes to dominions debt covenants.
dividend restrictions certain agreements associated with dominions credit facilities contain restrictions on the ratio of debt to total capitalization. these limitations did not restrict dominions ability to pay dividends or receive dividends from its subsidiaries at december 31, 2015.
see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of potential restrictions on dividend payments by dominion in connection with the deferral of interest payments on junior subordinated notes and equity units, initially in the form of corporate units, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, continued future cash payments for contractual obligations and planned capital expenditures contractual obligations dominion is party to numerous contracts and arrangements obligating it to make cash payments in future years. these contracts include financing arrangements such as debt agreements and leases, as well as contracts for the purchase of goods and services and financial derivatives. presented below is a table summarizing cash payments that may result from contracts to which dominion is a party as of december 31, 2015. for purchase obligations and other liabilities, amounts are based upon contract terms, including fixed and minimum quantities to be purchased at fixed or market-based prices. actual cash payments will be based upon actual quantities purchased and prices paid and will likely differ from amounts presented below. the table excludes all amounts classified as current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, other than current maturities of long-term debt, interest payable and certain derivative instruments. the majority of dominions current liabilities will be paid in cash in 2016.

other long-term liabilities(6):
(1)                                               based on stated maturity dates rather than the earlier redemption dates that could be elected by instrument holders. in february 2016, dominion purchased and cancelled $100 million of variable rate short-term notes that would have otherwise matured in may 2016 using the proceeds from the february 2016 issuance of senior notes that mature in 2018. as a result, at december 31, 2015, $100 million of the notes were included in long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets.
(2)                                  includes interest payments over the terms of the debt and payments on related stock purchase contracts. interest is calculated using the applicable interest rate or forward interest rate curve at december 31, 2015 and outstanding principal for each instrument with the terms ending at each instruments stated maturity. see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. does not reflect dominions ability to defer interest and stock purchase contract payments on junior subordinated notes or rsns and equity units, initially in the form of corporate units.
(5)   includes capital, operations, and maintenance commitments.
(6)                                              excludes regulatory liabilities, aros and employee benefit plan obligations, which are not contractually fixed as to timing and amount. see notes 12, 14 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements. due to uncertainty about the timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, $67 million of income taxes payable associated with unrecognized tax benefits are excluded. deferred income taxes are also excluded since cash payments are based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
planned capital expenditures dominions planned capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $6.9 billion, $4.9 billion and $4.3 billion in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. dominions planned expenditures include construction and expansion of electric generation and natural gas transmission and storage facilities, construction improvements and expansion of electric transmission and distribution assets, purchases of nuclear fuel, the construction of the liquefaction project and funding of dominions portion of the atlantic coast pipeline project.
dominion expects to fund its capital expenditures with cash from operations and a combination of securities issuances and short-term borrowings. planned capital expenditures include capital projects that are subject to approval by regulators and the board of directors.
see dvp, dominion generation and dominion energy-properties in item 1. business for a discussion of dominions expansion plans.
these estimates are based on a capital expenditures plan reviewed and endorsed by dominions board of directors in late 2015 and are subject to continuing review and adjustment and actual capital expenditures may vary from these estimates. dominion may also choose to postpone or cancel certain planned capital expenditures in order to mitigate the need for future debt financings and equity issuances.
use of off-balance sheet arrangements guarantees dominion primarily enters into guarantee arrangements on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries. these arrangements are not subject to the provisions of fasb guidance that dictate a guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
future issues and other matters see item 1. business and notes 13 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on various environmental, regulatory, legal and other matters that may impact future results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.
environmental matters dominion is subject to costs resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment. these laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. they can result in increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations.
environmental protection and monitoring expenditures dominion incurred $190 million, $192 million and $182 million of expenses (including depreciation) during 2015, 2014, and 2013 respectively, in connection with environmental protection and monitoring activities, excluding charges related to ash pond and landfill closure costs, and expects these expenses to be approximately $186 million and $187 million in 2016 and 2017,
respectively. in addition, capital expenditures related to environmental controls were $59 million, $101 million, and $64 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. these expenditures are expected to be approximately $85 million and $113 million for 2016 and 2017, respectively.
future environmental regulations air the caa is a comprehensive program utilizing a broad range of regulatory tools to protect and preserve the nations air quality. at a minimum, delegated states are required to establish regulatory programs to address all requirements of the caa. however, states may choose to develop regulatory programs that are more restrictive. many of the companies facilities are subject to the caas permitting and other requirements.
in august 2015, the epa issued final carbon standards for existing fossil fuel power plants. known as the clean power plan, the rule uses a set of measures for reducing emissions from existing sources that includes efficiency improvements at coal plants, displacing coal-fired generation with increased utilization of natural gas combined cycle units and expanding renewable resources. the new rule requires states to impose standards of performance limits for existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units or equivalent statewide intensity-based or mass-based co2 binding goals or limits. states are required to submit interim plans to the epa by september 2016 identifying how they will comply with the rule, with final plans due by september 2018. the epa also proposed a federal plan and model trading rules that, when finalized, states can adopt or that would be put in place if, in response to the final guidelines, a state either does not submit a state plan or its plan is not approved by the epa. virginia powers most recent integrated resources plan filed in july 2015 includes four alternative plans that represent plausible compliance strategies with the rule as proposed, and which include additional coal unit retirements and additional low or zero-carbon resources. the final rule has been challenged in the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit. in february 2016, the u.s. supreme court issued a stay of the clean power plan until the disposition of the petitions challenging the rule now before the court of appeals, and, if such petitions are filed in the future, before the u.s. supreme court. dominion does not know whether these legal challenges will impact the submittal deadlines for the state implementation plans. subsequent to the stay, virginia has announced that it will continue development of a state plan. unless the rule survives the court challenges and until the state plans are developed and the epa approves the plans, dominion cannot predict the potential financial statement impacts but believes the potential expenditures to comply could be material.
in december 2012, the epa issued a final rule that set a more stringent annual air quality standard for fine particulate matter. the epa issued final attainment/nonattainment designations in january 2015. until states develop their implementation plans, dominion cannot determine whether or how facilities located in areas designated nonattainment for the standard will be impacted, but does not expect such impacts to be material.
the epa has finalized rules establishing a new 1-hour naaqs for no2 and a new 1-hour naaqs for so2, which could require additional nox and so2 controls in certain areas where dominion operates. until the states have developed implementation plans for these standards, the impact on dominions facilities that emit nox and so2 is uncertain. additionally, the impact of permit limits for implementing naaqs on dominions facilities is uncertain at this time.
in june 2005, the epa finalized amendments to the regional haze rule, also known as the clean air visibility rule. the rule requires the states to implement best available retrofit technology requirements for sources to address impacts to visual air quality through regional haze state implementation plans, but allows other alternative options. dominion anticipates that the emission reductions achieved through compliance with other caa-required programs will generally address this rule.
in december 2015, the epa published a proposed revision to csapr. the proposal substantially reduces the csapr phase ii ozone season nox emission caps in 23 states including virginia, west virginia and north carolina, relative to the phase ii caps under the current csapr rule, that would take effect beginning with the 2017 ozone season. the proposed reductions in state ozone season nox caps would in turn reduce, by approximately 55% overall, the number of allowances dominion electric generating units will receive under the csapr ozone season nox program beginning with the 2017 may - september ozone season. in addition, the epa is proposing to discount the use of banked phase i allowances for compliance in phase ii by applying either a 2:1 or 4:1 surrender ratio. until the proposal is finalized, dominion is unable to predict with certainty the impact to future csapr ozone season allowance streams and to what extent the rule may require additional controls. the epa expects to issue a final revision to csapr in august 2016.
in april 2014, the pennsylvania department of environmental protection issued proposed regulations to reduce nox and voc emissions from combustion sources. the regulations are expected to be finalized in the second quarter of 2016. to comply with the regulations, dominion gas anticipates installing emission control systems on existing engines at several compressor stations in pennsylvania. until the regulations are finalized, dominion gas cannot estimate the potential impacts on results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows related to this matter.
climate change in december 2015, the paris agreement was formally adopted under the united nations framework convention on climate change. the accord establishes a universal framework for addressing ghg emissions involving actions by all nations through the concept of nationally determined contributions in which each nation defines the ghg commitment it can make and sets in place a process for increasing those commitments every five years. it also contains a global goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels and to aim to reach global peaking of ghg emissions as soon as possible.
a key element of the initial u.s. nationally determined contributions of achieving a 26% to 28% reduction below 2005 levels by 2025 is the implementation of the clean power plan, which establishes interim emission reduction targets for fossil fuel-fired electric generating units over the period 2022 through
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, continued
2029 with final targets to be achieved by 2030. the epa estimates that the clean power plan will result in a nationwide reduction in co2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units of 32% from 2005 levels by 2030.
dodd-frank act the dodd-frank act was enacted into law in july 2010 in an effort to improve regulation of financial markets. the cea, as amended by title vii of the dodd-frank act, requires certain over-the counter derivatives, or swaps, to be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization and, if the swap is subject to a clearing requirement, to be executed on a designated contract market or swap execution facility. non-financial entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, often referred to as end users, may elect the end-user exception to the ceas clearing requirements. dominion has elected to exempt its swaps from the ceas clearing requirements. the cftc may continue to adopt final rules and implement provisions of the dodd-frank act through its ongoing rulemaking process, including rules regarding margin requirements for non-cleared swaps. if, as a result of the rulemaking process, dominions derivative activities are not exempted from clearing, exchange trading or margin requirements, it could be subject to higher costs due to decreased market liquidity or increased margin payments. in addition, dominions swap dealer counterparties may attempt to pass-through additional trading costs in connection with the implementation of, and compliance with, title vii of the dodd-frank act. due to the ongoing rulemaking process, dominion is currently unable to assess the potential impact of the dodd-frank acts derivative-related provisions on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

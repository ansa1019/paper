item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a)
executive summary key strategic goals at pnc we manage our company for the long term. we are focused on the fundamentals of growing customers, loans, deposits and fee revenue and improving profitability, while investing for the future and managing risk, expenses and capital. we continue to invest in our products, markets and brand, and embrace our corporate responsibility to the communities where we do business.
we strive to expand and deepen customer relationships by offering a broad range of deposit, fee-based and credit products and services. we are focused on delivering those products and services where, when and how our customers choose with the goal of offering insight that addresses their specific financial objectives. our approach is concentrated on organically growing and deepening client relationships that meet our risk/return measures. our strategies for growing fee income across our lines of business are focused on achieving deeper market penetration and cross selling our diverse product mix to meet the broad range of financial needs of our customers.
our strategic priorities are designed to enhance value over the long term. a key priority is to build a leading banking franchise in our underpenetrated geographic markets. in addition, we are seeking to attract more of the investable assets of new and existing clients. pnc is focused on redefining the retail banking experience by transforming to a more customer-centric and sustainable model while lowering delivery costs as customer banking preferences evolve. additionally, we continue to focus on expense management while investing in technology to bolster critical business infrastructure and streamline core processes.
our capital priorities are to support client growth and business investment, maintain appropriate capital in light of economic conditions and the basel iii framework and return excess capital to shareholders, in accordance with the capital plan included in the current comprehensive capital analysis and review (ccar) submission to the board of governors of the federal reserve system (federal reserve). new regulatory short-term liquidity standards became effective for pnc and pnc bank, national association (pnc bank) beginning january 1, 2015. for more detail, see the balance sheet, liquidity and capital highlights portion of this executive summary, the capital portion of the consolidated balance sheet review section and the liquidity risk management portion of the risk management section of this item 7 and the supervision and regulation section in item 1 business of this report.
key factors affecting financial performance pnc faces a variety of risks that may impact various aspects of our risk profile from time to time. the extent of such impacts may vary depending on factors such as the current economic, political and regulatory environment, merger and acquisition activity and operational challenges. many of these risks and our risk management strategies are described in more detail elsewhere in this report.

average common shareholders equity                          9.50   %            9.91   %
                                                 net income for 2015 of $4.1 billion decreased 2% compared to 2014, as a 1% decline in revenue was partially offset by reductions in noninterest expense and the provision for credit losses. lower revenue was driven by a 3% decrease in net interest income, offset in part by a 1% increase in noninterest income reflecting strong fee income growth. for additional detail, see the consolidated income statement review section in this item 7.
   net interest income of $8.3 billion for 2015 decreased 3% compared to 2014 due to lower purchase accounting accretion and lower interest-earning asset yields, partially offset by commercial and commercial real estate loan growth and higher securities balances.
   net interest margin decreased to 2.74% for 2015 compared to 3.08% for 2014, principally due to the impact of increasing the companys liquidity position, lower benefit from purchase accounting accretion, and lower loan and securities yields.
   noninterest income of $6.9 billion for 2015 increased 1% compared with 2014, primarily driven by strong growth in consumer and corporate services fees and asset management revenue, partially offset by lower gains on asset sales and lower residential mortgage revenue.
   the provision for credit losses decreased to $255 million for 2015 compared to $273 million for 2014 due to improved credit quality.
                                               noninterest expense decreased $25 million to $9.5 billion for 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting pncs focus on expense management as higher personnel expense associated with higher business activity and investments in technology and business infrastructure were more than offset by lower legal and residential mortgage compliance costs and lower third party expenses.
credit quality highlights
   overall credit quality in 2015 improved from 2014. for additional detail, see the credit risk management portion of the risk management section of this item 7.
   overall loan delinquencies of $1.6 billion at december 31, 2015 decreased $.3 billion, or 16%, compared with december 31, 2014.
                                                   the allowance for loan and lease losses was 1.32% of total loans and 128% of nonperforming loans at december 31, 2015, compared with 1.63% and
133% at december 31, 2014, respectively. the decline in these ratios reflected pncs implementation of its change in the derecognition policy for purchased impaired pooled consumer and residential real estate loans, effective december 31,
2015. this change resulted in the derecognition of the recorded investment balance included in total loans and the associated allowance for loan losses balance each by $468 million.
for additional detail, see the credit risk management portion of the risk management section and the purchase accounting accretion and valuation of purchased impaired loans portion of the consolidated balance sheet review of this item 7.
balance sheet, liquidity and capital highlights pncs balance sheet was well-positioned at december 31, 2015 reflecting strong liquidity and capital positions.
   total consumer lending decreased $3.3 billion, or 4%, due to declines in home equity, education, and automobile loans, and included declines in the non-strategic consumer loan portfolio.
   total deposits increased $16.8 billion, or 7%, to $249.0 billion at december 31, 2015 compared with december 31, 2014, reflecting overall strong deposit growth.
   investment securities increased $14.7 billion, or 26%, to $70.5 billion at december 31, 2015 compared to december 31, 2014.
   pncs balance sheet remained core funded with a loans to deposits ratio of 83% at december 31, 2015.
   pnc maintained a strong liquidity position.
   new regulatory short-term liquidity standards became effective for pnc and pnc bank as advanced approaches banking organizations beginning january 1, 2015, with a minimum phased-in liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) requirement of 80% in 2015, calculated as of month end.
   the liquidity coverage ratio at december 31, 2015 exceeded 100% for both pnc and pnc bank.
   pnc maintained a strong capital position.
   the transitional basel iii common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 10.6% at december 31, 2015 and 10.9% at december 31, 2014, calculated using the regulatory capital methodologies applicable to pnc during 2015 and 2014, respectively.
                                                  pro forma fully phased-in basel iii common equity tier 1 capital ratio was an estimated 10.0% at both december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014
based on the standardized approach rules. see the capital discussion and table 19 in the consolidated balance sheet review section of this item 7 and the december 31, 2014 capital ratio tables in the statistical information (unaudited)
section in item 8 of this report for more detail.
   pnc returned capital to shareholders during 2015.
6%, effective with the may dividend.
   in may 2015, we redeemed $500 million of pncs fixed-to-floating rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series k, as well as all depositary shares representing interests therein.
see the capital portion of the consolidated balance sheet review for more detail on the 2015 preferred stock redemption and common share repurchases, including the completion of share repurchases included in our 2014 capital plan and repurchases authorized by our 2015 capital plan, and the liquidity risk management portion of the risk management section of this item 7 for more detail on our other 2015 capital and liquidity actions.
our ability to take certain capital actions, including plans to pay or increase common stock dividends or to repurchase shares under current or future programs, is subject to the results of the supervisory assessment of capital adequacy undertaken by the federal reserve as part of the ccar process. for additional information, see the supervision and regulation section in item 1 business of this report.
our consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet review sections of this item 7 describe in greater detail the various items that impacted our results during 2015 and 2014 and balances at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively.

total assets were $358.5 billion at december 31, 2015 compared with $345.1 billion at december 31, 2014. the increase from year end 2014 was primarily due to higher investment securities and loan growth.
various seasonal and other factors impact our period-end balances, whereas average balances are generally more indicative of underlying business trends apart from the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. the consolidated balance sheet review section of this item 7 provides information on changes in selected consolidated balance sheet categories at december 31, 2015 compared with december 31, 2014.
average investment securities increased during 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to increases in average agency residential mortgage-backed securities and u.s. treasury and government agency securities, partially offset by a decrease in average non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities.
total investment securities comprised 20% of average interest-earning assets in 2015 and 2014.
average loans grew in 2015, driven by increases in average commercial loans of $5.7 billion and average commercial real estate loans of $2.5 billion. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in consumer loans of $2.4 billion primarily attributable to lower home equity and education loans, which included declines in the non-strategic consumer loan portfolio.
average interest-earning deposits with banks, which are primarily maintained with the federal reserve bank, increased significantly in the comparison to the prior year in part due to regulatory short-term liquidity standards phased in starting january 1, 2015 and also due to deposit growth.
average noninterest-earning assets increased in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily driven by higher receivables from unsettled securities sales, which are included in noninterest-earning assets for average balance sheet purposes, and an increase in trading assets, primarily net customer-related derivatives values.
average total deposits increased $17.4 billion, or 8%, in 2015 compared with the prior year, primarily due to increases in average money market deposits, average noninterest-bearing deposits and average interest-bearing demand deposits driven by both commercial and retail deposit growth.
average total deposits represented 68% of average total assets for 2015 and 2014.
average borrowed funds increased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to increases in average federal home loan bank (fhlb) borrowings and average bank notes and senior debt. these increases were partially offset by a decline in average commercial paper balances, in part due to actions to enhance pncs funding structure in light of regulatory liquidity standards and a rating agency methodology change. the liquidity risk management portion of the risk management section of this item 7 includes additional information regarding our borrowed funds.
business segment highlights total business segment earnings were $4.0 billion in 2015 and $3.9 billion in 2014. the business segments review section of this item 7 includes further analysis of our business segment results during 2015 and 2014, including presentation differences from note 23 segment reporting in our notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report. note 23 segment reporting presents results of businesses for 2015, 2014 and 2013, as well as a reconciliation of total business segment earnings to pnc total consolidated net income as reported on a gaap basis.

(a)                                            our business information is presented based on our internal management reporting practices. we periodically refine our internal methodologies as management reporting practices are enhanced. net interest income in business segment results reflects pncs internal funds transfer pricing methodology. assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing characteristics, tenor and other factors. in the first quarter of 2015, enhancements were made to pncs funds transfer pricing methodology primarily for costs related to the new regulatory short-term liquidity standards. the enhancements incorporate an additional charge assigned to assets, including for unfunded loan commitments. conversely, a higher transfer pricing credit has been assigned to those deposits that are accorded higher value under lcr rules for liquidity purposes. these adjustments apply to business segment results, primarily favorably impacting retail banking and adversely impacting corporate &amp; institutional banking, prospectively beginning with the first quarter of 2015. prior periods have not been adjusted due to the impracticability of estimating the impact of the change for prior periods.
(c)   other average assets include investment securities associated with asset and liability management activities.
(d)   other includes differences between the total business segment financial results and our total consolidated net income. additional detail is included in note
23 segment reporting in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
consolidated income statement review our consolidated income statement is presented in item 8 of this report.
net income for 2015 of $4.1 billion decreased 2% compared to 2014, as a 1% decline in revenue was partially offset by reductions in noninterest expense and the provision for credit losses. lower revenue was driven by a 3% decrease in net interest income, offset in part by a 1% increase in noninterest income reflecting strong fee income growth.
changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. see the statistical information (unaudited)  average consolidated balance sheet and net interest analysis and analysis of year-to-year changes in net interest income in item 8 of this report and the discussion of purchase accounting accretion on purchased impaired loans in the consolidated balance sheet review section in this item 7 for additional information.
net interest income decreased $247 million, or 3%, in 2015 compared with 2014 due to lower purchase accounting accretion and lower interest-earning asset yields driven by the ongoing low rate environment, partially offset by commercial and commercial real estate loan growth and higher securities balances. the decline also reflected the impact from the second quarter 2014 correction to reclassify certain commercial facility fees from net interest income to noninterest income.
38 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k net interest margin decreased in the comparison to the prior year, driven by a 32 basis point decline in the yield on total interest-earning assets, which was principally due to the impact of increasing the companys liquidity position, lower loan and securities yields, and lower benefit from purchase accounting accretion. the decline also included the impact of the second quarter 2014 correction to reclassify certain commercial facility fees.
we expect net interest income for the first quarter of 2016 to be stable, compared with fourth quarter 2015 in light of an unlikely increase in interest rates during the first quarter of 2016. for full year 2016, we expect purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $175 million compared to 2015.
service charges on deposits                    651               662       (11   )           (2   )%
net gains on sales of securities                43                 4        39                *
asset management revenue increased in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by new sales production and stronger average equity markets, as well as the benefit from a $30 million trust settlement during the second quarter of 2015. discretionary client assets under management in the asset management group were $134 billion at december 31, 2015 compared with $135 billion at december 31, 2014.
consumer service fees increased in the comparison to the prior year, primarily due to growth in customer-initiated transaction volumes related to debit card, credit card and merchant services activity, along with higher brokerage revenue.
corporate service fees increased in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by higher treasury management, commercial mortgage servicing and equity capital markets advisory fees, partially offset by lower mergers and acquisition advisory fees. the increase also reflected the impact of the correction to reclassify certain commercial facility fees from net interest income to noninterest income beginning in the second quarter of 2014.
other noninterest income decreased in 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily attributable to lower gains on asset dispositions, including the impact of the fourth quarter 2014 gain of $94 million on the sale of pncs washington, d.c. regional headquarters building and lower gains on sales of visa class b common shares.
gains on sales of two million visa class b common shares equaled $169 million in 2015 compared to gains of $209 million on sales of 3.5 million shares in 2014. as of december 31, 2015, we held approximately 4.9 million visa class b common shares with a fair value of approximately $622 million and a recorded investment of approximately $31 million.
other noninterest income typically fluctuates from period to period depending on the nature and magnitude of transactions completed. further details regarding our customer-related trading activities are included in the market risk management  customer-related trading risk portion of the risk management section of this item 7. further details regarding private and other equity investments are included in the market risk management  equity and other investment risk section, and further details regarding gains or losses related to our equity investment in blackrock are included in the business segments review section of this item 7.
in the first quarter of 2016, we expect fee income, consisting of asset management, consumer services, corporate services, residential mortgage and service charges on deposits, to be down mid-single digits, on a percentage basis, compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 due to seasonality and typically lower first quarter client activity. continued volatility in the equity markets in combination with other economic factors could add to pressure on noninterest income. for full year 2016, we expect modest growth in revenue.
provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses totaled $255 million in 2015 compared with $273 million in 2014, reflecting improved credit quality.
we expect our provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2016 to be between $75 million and $125 million. the performance of certain energy related loans during the first quarter could result in provision for credit losses at the high end of this range.
the credit risk management portion of the risk management section of this item 7 includes additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses.
noninterest expense noninterest expense decreased $25 million to $9.5 billion in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting pncs focus on expense management. higher personnel expense associated with higher business activity and investments in technology and business infrastructure were more than offset by lower legal and residential mortgage compliance costs and third party expenses, as well as the impact of the fourth quarter 2014 contribution to the pnc foundation.
for the first quarter of 2016, we expect noninterest expense to be down low-single digits, on a percentage basis, compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. for full year 2016, we expect total noninterest expense to be stable compared to 2015.
effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate was 24.8% for 2015 compared with 25.1% for 2014. the effective tax rate is generally lower than the statutory rate primarily due to tax credits pnc receives from our investments in low income housing and new markets investments, as well as earnings in other tax exempt investments.
the effective tax rate for 2015 included tax benefits attributable to settling acquired entity tax contingencies.

40 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k the summarized balance sheet data above is based upon our consolidated balance sheet in item 8 of this report.
pncs balance sheet reflected asset growth and strong liquidity and capital positions at december 31, 2015.
   total assets increased in 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase of $14.7 billion in investment securities driven by deposit growth.
   total liabilities increased in 2015 compared to 2014 mainly due to an increase in deposits.
   total equity in 2015 remained relatively stable compared to the prior year mainly due to increased retained earnings driven by net income, offset by share repurchases and the redemption of preferred stock.

the increase in loans was the result of an increase in total commercial lending driven by commercial real estate loans, partially offset by a decline in consumer lending due to lower home equity, education, and automobile loans.
commercial real estate loans represented 13% of total loans at december 31, 2015 and 11% of total loans at december 31, 2014 and represented 8% and 7% of total assets at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively. see the credit risk management portion of the risk management section of this item 7 for additional information regarding our loan portfolio.
for the first quarter of 2016, we expect total loans to be stable with the fourth quarter of 2015.

through the national city corporation (national city) and rbc bank (usa) acquisitions, we acquired purchased impaired loans with a recorded investment of $14.7 billion. as noted in table 11 above, at december 31, 2015, those balances are now $3.5 billion, of which $3.4 billion in consumer and residential real estate loans is accounted for using pool accounting. prior to december 31, 2015, upon final disposition of a loan within a pool and for loans that had nominal collateral value/expected cash flows, the loans carrying value was removed from the pool and any gain or loss associated with the transaction was retained in the pools recorded investment. effective december 31, 2015, in anticipation of the end of the life of our purchased impaired pooled consumer and residential real estate loans, and pursuant to supervisory direction, we changed our derecognition policy for these loans such that we will write-off the loans recorded investment and derecognize the associated alll upon final disposition. gains and losses on such loans will be recognized as either an adjustment to the pools associated alll, or yield, as appropriate. the transition to this new policy on december 31, 2015 resulted in a $468 million derecognition of recorded investment and associated alll on such loans, which is immaterial to our financial statements taken as a whole.
the result of this change accelerated the derecognition of a pools recorded investment and associated alll balance. these amounts represented the net loss from loan dispositions or expected cash flow shortfalls that had been retained as part of the pools recorded investment per our accounting for the pool as a single asset. the recorded investment that was derecognized effective december 31, 2015 had been fully reserved for. therefore, there was no impact to the net carrying values of the pools, or accretion accounting and no additional provision for credit losses for these derecognized loans was recorded, as the recorded investment and associated alll balance were reduced in equal amounts. we expect the future impact of this policy change to the consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet to be immaterial. see note 4 purchased loans and note 5 allowance for loan and lease losses and unfunded commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information.
purchased impaired loans  accretable difference sensitivity analysis the following table provides a sensitivity analysis on the total purchased impaired loans portfolio. the analysis reflects hypothetical changes in key drivers for expected cash flows over the life of the loans under declining and improving conditions at a point in time. any unusual significant economic events or changes, as well as other variables not considered below (e.g., natural or widespread disasters), could result in impacts outside of the ranges represented below. additionally, commercial and commercial real estate loan settlements or sales proceeds can vary widely from appraised values due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, special use considerations, liquidity premiums and improvements/deterioration in other income sources.

the present value impact of declining cash flows is primarily reflected as an immediate impairment charge resulting in a provision for credit losses and an increase to the allowance for loan and lease losses. the present value impact of increased cash flows is first recognized as a reversal of the allowance with any additional cash flow increases reflected as an increase in accretable yield over the life of the loan.
commitments to extend credit commitments to extend credit comprise the following:
table 13: commitments to extend credit (a)
home equity lines of credit           17,268           17,839
credit card                           19,937           17,833
(a)   commitments to extend credit, or net unfunded loan commitments, represent arrangements to lend funds or provide liquidity subject to specified contractual conditions.
in addition to the credit commitments set forth in the table above, our net outstanding standby letters of credit totaled $8.8 billion at december 31, 2015 and $10.0 billion at december 31, 2014. standby letters of credit commit us to make payments on behalf of our customers if specified future events occur.
information regarding our commitments to extend credit and our allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit is included in note 1 accounting policies, note 5 allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit and note 21 commitments and guarantees in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
investment securities the following table presents the distribution of our investment securities portfolio by credit rating. we have included credit ratings information because we believe that the information is an indicator of the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed. changes in credit ratings classifications could indicate increased or decreased credit risk and could be accompanied by a reduction or increase in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio. for those securities on our balance sheet at december 31, 2015, where during our quarterly security-level impairment assessments we determined losses represented other-than-temporary impairment (otti), we have recorded cumulative credit losses of $1.1 billion in earnings and accordingly have reduced the amortized cost of our securities. the majority of these cumulative impairment charges related to non-agency residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities rated bb or lower.

(c)   collateralized primarily by corporate debt, government guaranteed student loans and other consumer credit products.
(d)   includes available for sale and held to maturity securities.
investment securities represented 20% of total assets at december 31, 2015 and 16% at december 31, 2014.
we evaluate our investment securities portfolio in light of changing market conditions and other factors and, where appropriate, take steps to improve our overall positioning. we consider the portfolio to be well-diversified and of high quality. at december 31, 2015, 89% of the securities in the portfolio were rated aaa/aa, with u.s. treasury and government agencies, agency residential mortgage-backed and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities collectively representing 67% of the portfolio.
the investment securities portfolio includes both available for sale and held to maturity securities. securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses, representing the difference between
44 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k amortized cost and fair value, included in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax, on our consolidated balance sheet. securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. as of december 31, 2015, the amortized cost and fair value of available for sale securities totaled $55.3 billion and $55.8 billion, respectively, compared to an amortized cost and fair value as of december 31, 2014 of $43.2 billion and $44.2 billion, respectively. the amortized cost and fair value of held to maturity securities were $14.8 billion and $15.0 billion, respectively, at december 31, 2015, compared to $11.6 billion and $12.0 billion, respectively, at december 31, 2014.
the fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. the fair value of investment securities generally decreases when interest rates increase and vice versa. in addition, the fair value generally decreases when credit spreads widen and vice versa. net unrealized gains in the total investment securities portfolio decreased to $.7 billion at december 31, 2015 from $1.5 billion at december 31, 2014. the comparable amounts for the securities available for sale portfolio were $.5 billion at december 31, 2015 and $1.1 billion at december 31, 2014.
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt securities do not impact liquidity; however these gains and losses do affect capital under the regulatory capital rules. also, a change in the securities credit ratings could impact the liquidity of the securities and may be indicative of a change in credit quality, which could affect our risk-weighted assets and, therefore, our risk-based regulatory capital ratios under the regulatory capital rules. in addition, the amount representing the credit-related portion of otti on securities would reduce our earnings and regulatory capital ratios.
the duration of investment securities was 2.7 years at december 31, 2015. we estimate that, at december 31, 2015, the effective duration of investment securities was 2.8 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 2.6 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. comparable amounts at december 31, 2014 for the effective duration of investment securities were 2.2 years and 2.1 years, respectively.
based on current interest rates and expected prepayment speeds, the weighed-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio (excluding corporate stock and other) was 4.8 years at december 31, 2015 compared to 4.3 years at december 31, 2014. the weighted-average expected maturities of mortgage and other asset-backed debt securities were as follows as of december 31, 2015:
table 15: weighted-average expected maturity of mortgage and other asset-backed debt securities december 31, 2015                                     years agency residential mortgage-backed securities           4.8
non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities       5.6
agency commercial mortgage-backed securities            3.2
non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities        3.4
asset-backed securities                                 2.9
at least quarterly, we conduct a comprehensive security-level impairment assessment on all securities. if economic conditions, including home prices, were to deteriorate from current levels, and if market volatility and liquidity were to deteriorate from current levels, or if market interest rates were to increase or credit spreads were to widen appreciably, the valuation of our investment securities portfolio would likely be adversely affected and we could incur additional otti credit losses that would impact our consolidated income statement.
additional information regarding our investment securities is included in note 6 investment securities and note 7 fair value in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report.
residential mortgage loan origination volume was $10.5 billion during 2015 compared to $9.5 billion during 2014. the majority of such loans were originated under agency or federal housing administration (fha) standards. we sold $8.1 billion of loans and recognized loan sales revenue of $342 million during 2015. the comparable amounts for 2014

see the liquidity risk management portion of the risk management section of this item 7 for additional information regarding our 2015 capital and liquidity activities.
total deposits increased in the comparison due to strong growth in savings, demand, and money market deposits, partially offset by a decline in retail certificates of deposit. interest-bearing deposits represented 68% of total deposits at both december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014.
total borrowed funds decreased in the comparison as declines in commercial paper, federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements and subordinated debt were partially offset by higher net issuances of bank notes and senior debt. the changes in the composition of funding sources are attributable to pncs actions to enhance its funding structure in light of regulatory liquidity standards and a rating agency methodology change.
capital we manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing debt, equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions, managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.
we repurchase shares of pnc common stock under common stock repurchase authorizations approved from time to time by pncs board of directors and consistent with capital plans submitted to, and accepted by, the federal reserve. through the first quarter of 2015, we repurchased stock under our 2007 common stock repurchase program authorization that permitted us to purchase up to 25 million shares of pnc common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. effective as of march 31, 2015, pncs board of
46 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k directors approved the termination of the 2007 common stock repurchase program authorization, and replaced it with a new stock repurchase program authorization in the amount of 100 million shares of pnc common stock, effective april 1, 2015. the extent and timing of share repurchases under this authorization will depend on a number of factors including, among others, market and general economic conditions, economic and regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, the potential impact on our credit ratings, contractual and regulatory limitations, and the results of future supervisory assessments of capital adequacy and capital planning processes undertaken by the federal reserve as part of the ccar process.
in the first quarter of 2015, we repurchased 4.4 million common shares for $.4 billion and completed our common stock repurchase programs for the four quarter period that began in second quarter 2014 with total repurchases over that period of 17 million common shares for $1.5 billion. these repurchases were included in our 2014 capital plan accepted by the federal reserve as part of our 2014 ccar submission.
in connection with the 2015 ccar process, we submitted our 2015 capital plan, as approved by pncs board of directors, to the federal reserve in january 2015. the federal reserve accepted the capital plan and did not object to our proposed capital actions in march 2015. as provided for in the 2015 capital plan, we announced new share repurchase programs of up to $2.875 billion for the five quarter period beginning in the second quarter of 2015. these programs include repurchases of up to $375 million over the five quarter period related to stock issuances under employee benefit-related programs.
on may 4, 2015, we redeemed $500 million of pncs fixed-to-floating rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series k, as well as all depositary shares representing interests therein. all 50,000 shares of series k preferred stock, as well as all 500,000 depositary shares representing interests therein, were redeemed. the redemption price was $10,000 per share of series k preferred stock equivalent to $1,000 per depositary share, plus declared and unpaid dividends up to but excluding the redemption date.

the increase in total shareholders equity compared to december 31, 2014 was mainly due to a $2.8 billion increase in retained earnings, partially offset by common share repurchases of $2.1 billion and the redemption of $500 million of preferred stock. the increase in retained earnings was driven by net income of $4.1 billion, reduced by $1.3 billion of common and preferred dividends declared. common shares outstanding were 504 million and 523 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

2015 reduced estimated basel iii advanced approaches risk-weighted assets. we anticipate additional refinements may result in increases or decreases to this estimate through the parallel run qualification phase.

(i)   for comparative purposes only, the pro forma fully phased-in advanced approaches basel iii common equity tier 1 capital ratio estimate is 11.4%. this capital ratio is calculated using pro forma fully phased-in common equity tier 1 capital and dividing by estimated basel iii advanced approaches risk-weighted assets.
(j)   for comparative purposes only, the pro forma fully phased-in advanced approaches basel iii tier 1 risk-based capital ratio estimate is 12.7%. this capital ratio is calculated using fully phased-in tier 1 capital and dividing by estimated basel iii advanced approaches risk-weighted assets.
(k)                                         for comparative purposes only, the pro forma fully phased-in advanced approaches basel iii total capital risk-based capital ratio estimate is 14.3%. this ratio is calculated using fully phased-in total basel iii capital, which under the advanced approaches, additional tier 2 capital includes allowance for loan and leases losses in excess of basel expected credit losses, if any, up to 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets, and dividing by estimated basel iii advanced approaches risk-weighted assets.
(l)   leverage ratio is calculated based on tier 1 capital divided by average quarterly adjusted total assets.
(m)   supplementary leverage ratio is calculated based on tier 1 capital divided by supplementary leverage exposure. as advanced approaches banking organizations, pnc and pnc bank will be subject to a 3% minimum supplementary leverage ratio effective january 1, 2018.
48 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k the basel ii framework, which was adopted by the basel committee on banking supervision in 2004, seeks to provide more risk-sensitive regulatory capital calculations and promote enhanced risk management practices among large, internationally active banking organizations. the u.s. banking agencies initially adopted rules to implement the basel ii capital framework in 2004. in july 2013, the u.s. banking agencies adopted final rules (referred to as the advanced approaches) that modified the basel ii framework effective january 1, 2014. see the supervision and regulation section in item 1 business and item 1a risk factors of this report for additional information. prior to fully implementing the advanced approaches to calculate risk-weighted assets, pnc and pnc bank must successfully complete a parallel run qualification phase. both pnc and pnc bank entered this parallel run phase on january 1, 2013. although the minimum parallel run qualification period is four quarters, the parallel run period for pnc and pnc bank, now in its third year, is consistent with the experience of other u.s. advanced approaches banks that have all had multi-year parallel run periods. after pnc exits parallel run, its regulatory risk-based capital ratio for each measure (e.g., common equity tier 1 capital ratio) will be the lower of the ratios as calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches.
as a result of the staggered effective dates of the final u.s. basel iii regulatory capital rules (basel iii rules), as well as the fact that pnc remains in the parallel run qualification phase for the advanced approaches, pncs regulatory risk-based ratios in 2015 were calculated using the standardized approach, effective january 1, 2015, for determining risk-weighted assets, and the definitions of, and deductions from, regulatory capital under the basel iii rules (as such definitions and deductions are phased-in for 2015). we refer to the capital ratios calculated using the phased-in basel iii provisions in effect for 2015 and, for the risk-based ratios, standardized approach risk-weighted assets as the 2015 transitional basel iii ratios. under the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight. exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, past due exposures, equity exposures and securitization exposures are generally subject to higher risk weights than other types of exposures.
under the basel iii rules adopted by the u.s. banking agencies, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets must be deducted from capital (subject to a phase-in schedule) to the extent they individually exceed 10%, or in the aggregate exceed 15%, of the institutions adjusted common equity tier 1 capital. also, basel iii regulatory capital includes (subject to a phase-in schedule) accumulated other comprehensive income related to securities currently and previously held as available for sale, as well as pension and other postretirement plans.
federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest u.s. bank holding companies, including pnc, to have a level of regulatory capital well in excess of the regulatory minimum and have required the largest u.s. bank holding companies, including pnc, to have a capital buffer sufficient to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. we seek to manage our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and believe that our december 31, 2015 capital levels were aligned with them.
at december 31, 2015, pnc and pnc bank, our sole bank subsidiary, were both considered well capitalized, based on applicable u.s. regulatory capital ratio requirements. beginning in 2015, to qualify as well capitalized, pnc must have transitional basel iii capital ratios of at least 6% for tier 1 risk-based capital and 10% for total risk-based capital, and pnc bank must have transitional basel iii capital ratios of at least 6.5% for common equity tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% for tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for total risk-based capital, and a leverage ratio of at least 5%. to qualify as well capitalized in 2014, regulators required insured depository institutions, such as pnc bank, to maintain transitional basel iii capital ratios of at least 6% for tier 1 risk-based, 10% for total risk-based and 5% for leverage, and required bank holding companies, such as pnc, to maintain transitional basel iii regulatory capital ratios of at least 6% tier 1 risk-based and 10% for total risk-based.
the access to and cost of funding for new business initiatives, the ability to undertake new business initiatives including acquisitions, the ability to engage in expanded business activities, the ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares or other capital instruments, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in large part, on a financial institutions capital strength.
we provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts on pnc in the supervision and regulation section of item 1 business, item 1a risk factors and note 19 regulatory matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
off-balance sheet arrangements and variable interest entities we engage in a variety of activities that involve entities that are not consolidated or otherwise reflected in our consolidated balance sheet that are generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. additional information on these types of activities is included in the following sections of this report:
   commitments, including contractual obligations and other commitments, included within the risk management section of this item 7, and
   note 2 loan sale and servicing activities and variable interest entities,
   note 16 equity, and
   note 21 commitments and guarantees, all of which are in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report.
pnc consolidates variable interest entities (vies) when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. the primary beneficiary of a vie is determined to be the party that meets both of the following criteria: (i) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the vie; and (ii) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the vie.
a summary of vies, including those that we have consolidated and those in which we hold variable interests but have not consolidated into our financial statements, as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 is included in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report.
trust preferred securities and reit preferred securities see note 11 borrowed funds and note 16 equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information on trust preferred securities issued by pnc capital trust c and reit preferred securities issued by pnc preferred funding trust i and pnc preferred funding trust ii including information on contractual limitations potentially imposed on payments (including dividends) with respect to pnc and pnc banks equity capital securities.
50 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k fair value measurements in addition to the following, see note 7 fair value in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further information regarding fair value.
the following table summarizes the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively, and the portions of such assets and liabilities that are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. level 3 assets and liabilities are those where the fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs.
total liabilities                                                                    $4,892                    $495              $5,799             $716
total liabilities at fair value as a percentage of consolidated liabilities               2   %                                       2   %
level 3 liabilities as a percentage of total liabilities at fair value                                           10   %                                      12%
level 3 liabilities as a percentage of consolidated liabilities                                               &lt;1   %                                   &lt;1%
the majority of assets recorded at fair value are included in the securities available for sale portfolio. the majority of level 3 assets represent non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities in the securities available for sale portfolio, equity investments and mortgage servicing rights.
an instruments categorization within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs to a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification (transfer) of assets or liabilities between hierarchy levels. pncs policy is to recognize transfers in and transfers out as of the end of the reporting period. for additional information regarding the transfers of assets or liabilities between hierarchy levels, see note 7 fair value in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.

52 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k retail banking earned $907 million in 2015 compared with earnings of $728 million in 2014. the increase in earnings was driven by increased net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. retail banking continues to enhance the customer experience with refinements to product offerings that drive product value for consumers and small businesses. we are focused on growing customer share of wallet through the sale of liquidity, banking, and investment products that meet the broad range of financial needs of our customers.
retail banking continued to focus on the strategic priority of transforming the customer experience through transaction migration, branch network transformation and multi-channel sales and service strategies.
   in 2015, approximately 52% of consumer customers used non-teller channels for the majority of their transactions compared with 46% in 2014.
   deposit transactions via atm and mobile channels increased to 43% of total deposit transactions in 2015 compared with 35% for 2014.
                                                        integral to pncs retail branch transformation strategy, more than 375 branches operate under the universal model designed to enhance sales opportunities for branch personnel, in part, by driving higher atm and mobile deposits. during 2015, the total branch network was reduced by 81 branches and the atm network was increased by 351 atms. pnc had a network of 2,616 branches and 8,956
   instant debit card issuance, which enables us to print a customers debit card in a matter of minutes, is now available in nearly 700 branches, over 26% of the branch network.
   apple ipad technology is available in all of our branches to demonstrate product capabilities to customers and prospects.
total revenue for 2015 increased $400 million compared to 2014, which included a $302 million increase in net interest income primarily from the enhancements to internal funds transfer pricing methodology in the first quarter of 2015, as well as increases in deposit balances and interest rate spread on the value of deposits, partially offset by lower loan balances and interest rate spread compression on the value of loans.
noninterest income increased $98 million in 2015 compared to 2014. execution on our share of wallet strategy resulted in strong growth in consumer service fee income from payment-related products, specifically in debit, credit and merchant services, as well as increased brokerage fees. noninterest income included gains on sales of visa class b common shares of $169 million on two million shares in 2015 compared to $209 million on 3.5 million shares in 2014. excluding these gains, noninterest income increased $138 million, or 7%, in the comparison.
provision for credit losses and net charge-offs in 2015 declined by $18 million and $114 million, respectively, compared to 2014 due to improved credit quality.
noninterest expense in 2015 increased $136 million over 2014. increases in technology investments, sales-related and other compensation, and customer transaction-related costs were partially offset by reduced third party service expense and non-credit losses, as well as lower branch network expenses as a result of transaction migration to lower cost digital and atm channels.
the deposit strategy of retail banking is to remain disciplined on pricing, focused on growing and retaining relationship-based balances, executing on market specific deposit growth strategies, and providing a source of low-cost funding and liquidity to pnc.
in 2015, average total deposits of $145.8 billion increased $8.6 billion, or 6%, compared to 2014, driven by organic growth in the following deposit categories:
   money market deposits increased $4.3 billion, or 9%, to $54.6 billion.
   demand deposits increased $4.2 billion, or 7%, to $60.3 billion.
   savings deposits increased $2.5 billion, or 21%, to $14.4 billion.
the expected run-off of maturing certificates of deposit partially offset these increases, declining $2.4 billion, or 13%, in the comparison.
retail banking continued to focus on a relationship-based lending strategy that targets specific products and markets for growth. in 2015, average total loans declined $2.0 billion, or 3%, compared to 2014, driven by a decline in home equity loans and declines from run-off of non-strategic portions of the portfolios, as more fully described below.
            average home equity loans decreased $1.2 billion, or 4%, as pay-downs and payoffs on loans exceeded new booked volume, consistent with lower mortgage demand. retail bankings home equity loan portfolio is relationship based, with over 97% of the portfolio attributable to borrowers in our primary geographic footprint.
   average credit card balances increased $163 million, or 4%, as a result of efforts to increase credit card share of wallet through organic growth.

corporate & institutional banking earned $2.0 billion in 2015, a decrease of $75 million, or 4%, compared with 2014. the slight decrease in earnings was due to lower net interest income and an increase in noninterest expense, largely offset by higher noninterest income. we continue to focus on building client relationships where the risk-return profile is attractive, including in the southeast.
net interest income decreased $239 million, or 6%, in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to the impact of first quarter 2015 enhancements to internal funds transfer pricing methodology, continued interest rate spread compression on loans and deposits and lower purchase accounting accretion, partially offset by the impact of higher average loans and deposits. decreased net interest income in the comparison also reflected the impact from the second quarter 2014 correction to reclassify certain commercial facility usage fees from net interest income to corporate service fees.
corporate service fees increased $88 million, or 7%, in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to an increase in treasury management, commercial mortgage servicing and equity capital markets advisory fees, partially offset by lower merger and acquisition advisory fees. the prior year comparison also reflected the impact of the second quarter 2014 correction to reclassify certain commercial facility fees from net interest income to corporate service fees.
other noninterest income increased $104 million, or 23%, in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by higher corporate securities underwriting activity, multifamily loans originated for sale to agencies, derivative sales, and revenue associated with credit valuations for customer-related derivative activities.
overall credit quality remained generally stable in 2015. the provision for credit losses was essentially unchanged from 2014 and net charge-offs continued to be low relative to recent historic levels. nonperforming assets declined 7% in the year-over-year comparison; however, there was an increase in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to the third quarter of 2015, driven by deterioration in the oil and gas sector.
noninterest expense increased $84 million, or 4%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by investments in technology, other costs associated with business activities and higher asset writedowns.
average loans increased $8.4 billion, or 8%, in 2015 compared to the prior year, and period-end loan balances increased $4.7 billion, or 4%, at december 31, 2015 compared to prior year-end, reflecting solid growth in real estate, corporate banking, business credit and equipment finance:
   pnc real estate provides banking, financing and servicing solutions for commercial real estate clients across the country. average loans for this business increased $3.6 billion, or 13%, in 2015 compared with 2014, due to increased originations and higher utilization.
                                                 corporate banking business provides lending, treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to midsized and large corporations, government and not-for-profit entities. average loans for this business increased $3.4 billion, or 6%, in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to an increase in loan commitments from large corporate clients and specialty lending businesses, partially offset by the impact of ongoing capital and liquidity management activities.
   pnc business credit provides asset-based lending. the loan portfolio is relatively high yielding, with acceptable risk as the loans are mainly secured by short-term assets. average loans for this business increased $1.3 billion, or 10%, in 2015 compared with 2014, due to new originations.
billion in 2015, an increase of $.6 billion, or 5%, compared with 2014.
average deposits increased $7.1 billion, or 10%, in 2015 compared to the prior year, as a result of business growth and increases in demand, money market and certificates of deposit products.
the commercial loan servicing portfolio increased $70 billion, or 19%, at december 31, 2015 compared to december 31, 2014, as servicing additions from new and existing customers exceeded portfolio run-off.
product revenue in addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, corporate & institutional banking offers other services, including treasury management, capital markets-related products and services, and commercial mortgage banking activities. on a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is included in net interest income, corporate service fees and other noninterest income. from a segment perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is reflected in the corporate & institutional banking segment results and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses. the other information section in table 22 in the corporate & institutional banking portion of this business segments review section includes the consolidated revenue to pnc for these services. a discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services follows.
treasury management revenue, comprised of fees and net interest income from customer deposit balances, increased $100 million, or 8%, in 2015 compared with 2014, driven by growth in our commercial card, wholesale lockbox, pinacle®, funds transfer fees and liquidity-related revenue.
capital markets-related products and services include foreign exchange, derivatives, securities, loan syndications, mergers and acquisitions advisory, and equity capital markets advisory activities and related services. revenue from capital markets-related products and services increased $36 million, or 5%, in 2015 compared with 2014. the increase in the comparison was primarily driven by higher derivative sales and revenue associated with credit valuations for customer-related derivative activities, increased corporate securities underwriting activity and higher equity capital markets advisory fees, partially offset by lower merger and acquisition advisory fees.
commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (including net interest income and noninterest income) and revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and related hedges. total commercial mortgage banking activities increased $43 million, or 11%, in 2015 compared with 2014. the increase in the comparison was mainly due to higher mortgage servicing revenue and higher multifamily loans originated for sale to agencies, partially offset by lower net valuation adjustment on commercial mortgage servicing rights.

(c)   recorded investment of purchased impaired loans related to acquisitions.
total revenue for 2015 increased $54 million compared to 2014. noninterest income increased $51 million, or 6%, primarily relating to the impact from a $30 million trust settlement in the second quarter of 2015, new sales production and stronger average equity markets. net interest income increased $3 million, or 1%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in average loan and deposit balances, partially offset by continued spread compression.
noninterest expense increased by $25 million, or 3%, in 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily attributable to higher compensation expense and investments in technology. asset management group remains focused on disciplined expense management as it invests in strategic growth opportunities.
the core growth strategies of the business include increasing sales sourced from other pnc lines of business, maximizing front line productivity and optimizing market presence in high opportunity markets. wealth management and hawthorn have over 100 offices operating in 7 out of the 10 most affluent states in the u.s. with a majority co-located with retail banking branches. the businesses strategies primarily focus on growing client assets under management through expanding relationships directly and through cross-selling from pncs other lines of business.
institutional asset management provides advisory, custody, and retirement administration services to institutional clients primarily within our banking footprint. the business also offers pnc proprietary mutual funds and investment strategies. institutional asset management is strengthening its partnership with corporate and institutional banking and other internal channels to drive growth and is focused on building retirement capabilities and expanding product solutions for all customers.
assets under administration were $259 billion as of december 31, 2015 compared to $263 billion as of december 31, 2014, largely due to a decline in nondiscretionary client assets under administration. discretionary client assets under management decreased $1 billion at december 31, 2015 compared to december 31, 2014, driven by lower equity markets on a spot basis, partially offset by positive net flows, after adjustments for cyclical client activities.
average loan balances increased $.2 billion, or 3%, in 2015 compared to the prior year due to continued growth in the consumer loan portfolio. asset management groups clients preference for liquidity in the form of a new line of credit product has driven significant growth in the loan portfolio. the line of credit product is primarily secured by the market value of the clients underlying investment management account assets. average deposits for 2015 increased $1.5 billion, or 15%, compared to the prior year, driven by an increase in money market products.

(b)   mortgages with borrowers as part of residential real estate purchase transactions.
the strategic focus of the business is the acquisition of new customers through a retail loan officer sales force with an emphasis on home purchase transactions. our strategy involves competing on the basis of superior service to new and existing customers in serving their home purchase and refinancing needs. a key consideration in pursuing this approach is the cross-sell opportunity, especially in the bank footprint markets.
billion of residential mortgage servicing rights were acquired, compared with $4 billion in 2014.
   noninterest income declined $38 million in 2015 compared with the prior year period, as increased net hedging gains on residential mortgage servicing rights were more than offset by decreased loan sales and servicing revenue.
   noninterest expense declined $55 million in 2015 compared with the 2014 period, primarily as a result of lower legal accruals and mortgage compliance costs.
                                                investors having purchased mortgage loans may request pnc to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans that they believe do not comply with applicable contractual loan origination covenants and representations and warranties we have made. at december 31, 2015, the liability for estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification claims for the residential mortgage banking business segment was $94 million, compared with $107 million at december 31, 2014. see the recourse and repurchase obligations section of this item 7 and note 21 commitments and guarantees in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report for additional information.

(d)   does not include liquidity discount.
in addition to our investment in blackrock reflected in table 25, at december 31, 2015, we held approximately 1.3 million shares of blackrock series c preferred stock valued at $357 million, which are available to fund our obligation in connection with certain blackrock long-term incentive plan (ltip) programs. additional information regarding our blackrock ltip share obligations is included in note 13 stock based compensation plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
we account for the blackrock series c preferred stock at fair value, which offsets the impact of marking-to-market the obligation to deliver these shares to blackrock. the fair value amount of the blackrock series c preferred stock is included on our consolidated balance sheet in the caption other assets. additional information regarding the valuation of the blackrock series c preferred stock is included in note 7 fair value in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.

(d)   recorded investment of purchased impaired loans related to acquisitions. this segment contained 81% of pncs purchased impaired loans at december 31, 2015 and
this business segment consists of non-strategic assets primarily obtained through acquisitions of other companies. the business activity of this segment is to manage the wind-down of the portfolios while maximizing the value and mitigating risk.
non-strategic assets portfolio had earnings of $301 million in 2015 compared with $367 million in 2014. earnings decreased year-over-year primarily due to a declining balance in the loan portfolio.
   net interest income declined $155 million, or 28%, in 2015 compared with 2014, resulting from lower purchase accounting accretion and the impact of the declining average balance of the loan portfolio.
   provision for credit losses was a benefit in both 2015 and 2014, reflecting continued improvements in credit quality.
   noninterest expense declined $42 million, or 34%, in 2015 compared with 2014, due to lower costs of managing and servicing the loan portfolio and a release of legal reserves in december 2015.
   average portfolio loans declined $1.7 billion, or 18%, in 2015 compared to 2014, due to customer payment activity and portfolio management activities to reduce under-performing assets.
                                                       effective december 31, 2015, pnc implemented its change in the derecognition policy for purchased impaired pooled consumer and residential real estate loans, resulting in the derecognition of the recorded investment balance included in total loans and the associated allowance for loan losses balance each by $468 million, 93% of which was recorded in the non-strategic assets portfolio. the decline in average loans in the year-over-year comparison reflected the impact of this change.
critical accounting estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. note 1 accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. certain of these policies require us to make estimates or economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions and such variations may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods.
fair value measurements we must use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value.
assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by independent third-party sources, including appraisers and valuation specialists, when available. when such third-party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques. changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations.
pnc applies asc 820  fair value measurements. this guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. this guidance requires a three level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. the classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used in the measurement are observable or unobservable.
the following sections of this report provide further information on this type of activity:
   fair value measurements included within this item 7, and
   note 7 fair value included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we maintain the alll and the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at levels that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolios and on these unfunded credit facilities as of the balance sheet date. our determination of the allowances is based on periodic evaluations of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded credit facilities and other relevant factors. these critical estimates include significant use of pncs own historical data and complex methods to interpret them. we have an ongoing process to evaluate and enhance the quality, quantity and timeliness of our data and interpretation methods used in the determination of these allowances. these evaluations are inherently subjective, as they require material estimates and may be susceptible to significant change, and include, among others:
   probability of default (pd),
   qualitative factors, such as changes in current economic conditions, that may not be reflected in modeled results.
for all loans, the alll is the sum of three components: (i) asset specific/individual impaired reserves, (ii) quantitative (formulaic or pooled) reserves and (iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. the reserve calculation and determination process is dependent on the use of key assumptions. key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower, and economic conditions. for unfunded commitments, the reserve estimate also includes estimation of the probability of funding. key reserve assumptions are periodically updated.
to the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates, additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce future earnings. see the following for additional information:
   allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the credit risk management section of this item 7, and
              note 1 accounting policies and note 5 allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements and allocation of allowance for loan and lease losses in the statistical information (unaudited) section of item 8 of this report.
62 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k estimated cash flows on purchased impaired loans asc 310-30  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality (formerly sop 03-3) provides the gaap guidance for the accounting for purchased impaired loans. these loans have experienced a deterioration of credit quality from origination to acquisition for which it is probable that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments receivable, including both principal and interest.
in our assessment of credit quality deterioration, we must make numerous assumptions, interpretations and judgments, using internal and third-party credit quality information to determine whether it is probable that we will be able to collect all contractually required payments. this point in time assessment is inherently subjective due to the nature of the available information and judgment involved.
those loans that qualify under asc 310-30 are recorded at fair value at acquisition, which involves estimating the expected cash flows to be received. measurement of the fair value of the loan is based on the provisions of asc 820. asc 310-30 prohibits the carryover or establishment of an allowance for loan losses on the acquisition date.
subsequent to the acquisition of the loan, we are required to continue to estimate cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the loan (or pool of loans). the measurement of expected cash flows involves assumptions and judgments as to credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, default rates, loss severity, payment speeds and collateral values. all of these factors are inherently subjective and can result in significant changes in the cash flow estimates over the life of the loan. such changes in expected cash flows could increase future earnings volatility.

goodwill goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. most of our goodwill relates to value inherent in the retail banking and corporate & institutional banking businesses. the value of this goodwill is dependent upon our ability to provide quality, cost-effective services in the face of competition from other market participants on a national and, with respect to some products and services, an international basis. we also rely upon continuing investments in processing systems, the development of value-added service features, and the ease of access by customers to our services.
as such, the value of goodwill is supported by earnings, which is driven by transaction volume and, for certain businesses, the market value of assets under administration or for which processing services are provided. lower earnings resulting from a lack of growth or our inability to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill, which could result in a current period charge to earnings. at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances have changed significantly from the annual test date, management reviews the current operating environment and strategic direction of each reporting unit taking into consideration any events or changes in circumstances that may have an effect on the unit. for this review, inputs are generated and used in calculating the fair value of the reporting unit, which is compared to its carrying amount (step 1 of the goodwill impairment test) as further discussed below. the fair values of the majority of our reporting units are determined using a discounted cash flow valuation model with assumptions based upon market comparables. additionally, we may also evaluate certain financial metrics that are indicative of fair value, including market quotes, price to earnings ratios and recent acquisitions involving other financial institutions. a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the reporting unit is not considered impaired. however, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the reporting units goodwill would be evaluated for impairment. in this circumstance, the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill would be compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill (step 2 of the goodwill impairment test). if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss. the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill is determined by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to its assets and liabilities (including any unrecognized intangible assets) with the residual amount equal to the implied fair value of goodwill as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.
a reporting units carrying amount is based upon assigned economic capital as determined by pncs internal management methodologies. additionally, in performing step 1 of our goodwill impairment testing, we utilize three equity metrics:
   assigned reporting unit economic capital as determined by our internal management methodologies, inclusive of goodwill.
   a 7% fully phased-in basel iii common equity tier 1 capital ratio for the reporting unit consistent with pncs risk framework guidelines.
   the capital levels for comparable companies (as reported in comparable company public financial statements), adjusted for differences in risk characteristics between the comparable companies and the reporting unit.
for reporting units with goodwill, when determining the reporting units fair value and comparing it to its carrying value, we generally utilize the highest of these three amounts (the targeted equity) in our discounted cash flow methodology. under this methodology, if necessary, we will infuse capital to achieve the targeted equity amount. as of october 1, 2015 (annual impairment testing date), unallocated excess capital (difference between shareholders equity minus total economic capital assigned and increased by the incremental targeted equity net capital infusion) represented capital reserved for potential future capital needs.
the results of our annual 2015 impairment test indicated that the estimated fair values of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying values by at least 10% and are not considered to be at risk of not passing step 1. by definition, assumptions utilized in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit are judgmental and inherently uncertain, but absent a significant change in economic conditions of a reporting unit, we would not expect the fair values of these reporting units to decrease below their respective carrying values. similarly, there were no impairment charges related to goodwill in 2014 or 2013.
see note 8 goodwill and intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information.
lease residuals we provide financing for various types of equipment, including aircraft, energy and power systems, and vehicles through a variety of lease arrangements. direct financing leases are carried at the sum of lease payments and the estimated residual value of the leased property, less unearned income. residual values are subject to judgments as to the value of the underlying equipment that can be affected by changes in economic and market conditions and the financial viability of the residual guarantors. residual values are derived from historical remarketing experience, secondary market contacts, and industry publications. to the extent not guaranteed or assumed by a third-party, we bear the risk of ownership of the leased assets. this includes the risk that the actual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term will be less than the estimated residual value, which could result in an impairment charge and reduce earnings in the future. residual values are reviewed for impairment at least annually.
revenue recognition we earn net interest and noninterest income from various sources, including:
   securities portfolio,
   customer deposits,
   sale of loans and securities,
   certain private equity activities, and
   securities, derivatives and foreign exchange activities.
we also earn fees and commissions from issuing loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, selling various insurance products, providing treasury management services, providing merger and acquisition advisory and related services, and participating in certain capital markets transactions. revenue earned on interest-earning assets, including the accretion of discounts recognized on acquired or purchased loans recorded at fair value, is recognized based on the constant effective yield of the financial instrument or based on other applicable accounting guidance.
the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize in any period is dependent on estimates, judgments, assumptions, and interpretation of contractual terms. changes in these factors can have a significant impact on revenue recognized in any period due to changes in products, market conditions or industry norms.
residential and commercial mortgage servicing rights we elect to measure our residential and commercial mortgage servicing rights (msrs) at fair value. this election was made to be consistent with our risk management strategy to hedge changes in the fair value of these assets. the fair value of residential and commercial msrs is estimated by using a cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and other economic factors which are determined based on current market conditions. prior to 2014, commercial msrs were initially recorded at fair value and subsequently accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. commercial msrs were periodically evaluated for impairment.
pnc employs risk management strategies designed to protect the value of msrs from changes in interest rates and related market factors. the values of the residential and commercial msrs are economically hedged with securities and derivatives, including interest-rate swaps, options, and forward mortgage-backed and futures contracts. as interest rates change, these financial instruments are expected to have changes in fair value negatively correlated to the change in fair value of the hedged msr portfolios. the hedge relationships are actively managed in response to changing market conditions over the life of the msrs. selecting appropriate financial instruments to economically hedge residential or commercial msrs requires significant

income taxes in the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries enter into transactions for which the tax treatment is unclear or subject to varying interpretations. in addition, filing requirements, methods of filing and the calculation of taxable income in various state and local jurisdictions are subject to differing interpretations.
we evaluate and assess the relative risks and merits of the tax treatment of transactions, filing positions, filing methods and taxable income calculations after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other information, and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation of these relative risks and merits. the result of our evaluation and assessment is by its nature an estimate. we and our subsidiaries are routinely subject to audit and challenges from taxing authorities. in the event we resolve a challenge for an amount different than amounts previously accrued, we will account for the difference in the period in which we resolve the matter.
recently issued accounting standards in may 2014, the financial accounting standard board (fasb) issued asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606). this asu clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and replaces nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance in u.s. gaap with one accounting model. the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the satisfaction of a performance obligation by transfer of promised goods or services to customers. the asu also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. in august 2015, the fasb issued guidance deferring the mandatory effective date of the asu for one year, to annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. the requirements within asu 2014-09 should be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented (with several practical expedients for certain completed contracts) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying asu 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application. we plan to adopt the asu consistent with the deferred mandatory effective date. based on our evaluation to date, we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or our consolidated financial position. additionally, we will continue to evaluate this standards impact as standard-setting, regulatory views and interpretations evolve.
in february 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-02, consolidation (topic 810): amendments to the consolidation analysis. all legal entities are subject to re-evaluation under this asu, including investment companies and certain other entities measured in a manner consistent with asc 946 financial services  investment companies which were previously excluded. the asu will change the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. specifically, the asu modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (vies) or voting interest entities; eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership; potentially changes the consolidation conclusions of reporting entities that are involved with vies, in particular those that have fee arrangements and related party arrangements, and provides a scope exception for reporting entities with interests held in certain money market funds. the asu is effective for public business entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after december 15, 2015 and may be applied through a retrospective or modified retrospective approach. we adopted this standard as of january 1, 2016 under a modified retrospective approach. the impact of adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or our consolidated financial position.
in january 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-01, financial instruments  overall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. this asu changes the accounting for certain equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option and presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. equity investments not accounted for under the equity method of accounting will be measured at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in net income. equity investments without readily determinable fair values may be measured at cost, adjusted for impairment and other changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for a similar investment of the same issuer. a qualitative assessment may be utilized to evaluate equity investments without readily determinable fair values for impairment. if impairment exists, the investment is required to be measured at fair value. in addition to the changes for certain equity investments, the asu also 1) requires that instrument-specific credit risk changes in the fair value of a financial liability accounted for under the fair value option be the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k 65
presented in other comprehensive income, 2) clarifies that an entity should consider deferred tax assets related to available-for-sale securities when evaluating the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, 3) eliminates the requirement for entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate disclosed fair values for financial instruments measured at amortized cost, 4) requires that the disclosed fair values represent an exit price, and 5) requires that financial assets and liabilities be presented by measurement category and form of instrument on the balance sheet or within the accompanying notes to the financial statements. the asu is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after december 15, 2017 and should be applied through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet, except for the amendment related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which should be applied prospectively. we plan to adopt all provisions consistent with the effective date and are currently evaluating the impact of this asu on our results of operations and financial position.
recently adopted accounting pronouncements see note 1 accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report regarding the impact of new accounting pronouncements which we have adopted.
status of qualified defined benefit pension plan we have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan (plan or pension plan) covering eligible employees. benefits are determined using a cash balance formula where earnings credits are applied as a percentage of eligible compensation. pension contributions are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants. consistent with our investment strategy, plan assets are primarily invested in equity investments and fixed income instruments. plan fiduciaries determine and review the plans investment policy, which is described more fully in note 12 employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
we calculate the expense associated with the pension plan and the assumptions and methods that we use include a policy of reflecting plan assets at their fair market value. on an annual basis, we review the actuarial assumptions related to the pension plan. the primary assumptions used to measure pension obligations and costs are the discount rate, mortality, compensation increase and expected long-term return on plan assets. among these, the compensation increase assumption does not significantly affect pension expense.
asc 715-30 and asc 715-60 stipulate that each individual assumption, including mortality, should reflect the plan sponsors best estimate. pnc has historically utilized a version of the society of actuaries (soa) published mortality tables in developing its best estimate of mortality. on october 27, 2014, the soa published a new study on mortality rates that included updated mortality tables and mortality improvement scale, which both reflect longer life expectancy. based on an evaluation of the mortality experience of pncs qualified pension plan participants in conjunction with the updated soa mortality study, pnc adopted an adjusted version of the soas new mortality table and improvement scale for purposes of measuring the plans benefit obligations at december 31, 2014. during 2015, the soa released an updated mortality improvement scale that generally validated the information that was considered when setting the current assumption, which remains unchanged from the mortality assumption adopted in 2014.
the discount rate used to measure pension obligations is determined by comparing the expected future benefits that will be paid under the plan with yields available on high quality corporate bonds of similar duration. the impact on pension expense of a .5% decrease in discount rate in the current environment is an increase of $18 million per year. this sensitivity depends on the economic environment and amount of unrecognized actuarial gains or losses on the measurement date.
the expected long-term return on assets assumption also has a significant effect on pension expense. the expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption established by considering historical and anticipated returns of the asset classes invested in by the pension plan and the asset allocation policy currently in place. for purposes of setting and reviewing this assumption, long term refers to the period over which the plans projected benefit obligations will be disbursed. we review this assumption at each measurement date and adjust it if warranted. our selection process references certain historical data and the current environment, but primarily utilizes qualitative judgment regarding future return expectations.
to evaluate the continued reasonableness of our assumption, we examine a variety of viewpoints and data. various studies have shown that portfolios comprised primarily of u.s. equity securities have historically returned approximately 9% annually over long periods of time, while u.s. debt securities have returned approximately 6% annually over long periods. application of these historical returns to the plans allocation ranges for equities and bonds produces a result between 6.50% and 7.25% and is one point of reference, among many other factors, that is taken into consideration. we also examine the plans actual historical returns over various periods and consider the current economic environment. recent experience is considered in our evaluation with appropriate consideration that, especially for short time periods, recent returns are not reliable indicators of future returns. while annual returns can vary significantly (actual returns for 2015,
acknowledging the potentially wide range for this assumption, we also annually examine the assumption used by other companies with similar pension investment strategies, so that we can ascertain whether our determinations markedly differ from others. in all cases, however, this data simply informs our process, which places the greatest emphasis on our qualitative judgment of future investment returns, given the conditions existing at each annual measurement date.
taking into consideration all of these factors, the expected long-term return on plan assets for determining net periodic pension cost for 2015 was 6.75%, down from 7.00% for 2014. this reduction was made after considering the views of both internal and external capital market advisors, particularly with regard to the effects of the recent economic environment on long-term prospective fixed income returns. we are maintaining our expected long-term return on assets at 6.75% for determining pension cost for 2016.
under current accounting rules, the difference between expected long-term returns and actual returns is accumulated and amortized to pension expense over future periods. each one percentage point difference in actual return compared with our expected return can cause expense in subsequent years to increase or decrease by up to $8 million as the impact is amortized into results of operations.
we currently estimate pretax pension expense of $43 million for 2016 compared with pretax expense of $9 million in 2015. this year-over-year expected increase in expense is mainly due to lower than expected asset returns during 2015, which reduced year-end pension asset balances and increased the amortization of actuarial losses in 2016.
table 27: pension expense  sensitivity analysis change in assumption (a) (in millions)                  estimated increase to 2016
our pension plan contribution requirements are not particularly sensitive to actuarial assumptions. investment performance has the most impact on contribution requirements and will drive the amount of required contributions in future years. also, current law, including the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006, sets limits as to both minimum and maximum contributions to the plan. we do not expect to be required to make any contributions to the plan during 2016. in february 2015, pnc made a $200 million voluntary contribution.
we maintain other defined benefit plans that have a less significant effect on financial results, including various nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees, which are described more fully in note 12 employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
recourse and repurchase obligations as discussed in note 2 loan sale and servicing activities and variable interest entities in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report, pnc has sold commercial mortgage, residential mortgage and home equity loans/lines of credit directly or indirectly through securitization and loan sale transactions in which we have continuing involvement. one form of continuing involvement includes certain recourse and loan repurchase obligations associated with the transferred assets.
commercial mortgage loan recourse obligations we originate and service certain multi-family commercial mortgage loans which are sold to fnma under fnmas delegated underwriting and servicing (dus) program. we participated in a similar program with the fhlmc. our exposure and activity associated with these recourse obligations are reported in the corporate & institutional banking segment. for more information regarding our commercial mortgage loan recourse obligations, see the recourse and repurchase obligations section of note 21 commitments and guarantees included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
residential mortgage and home equity repurchase obligations as a result of alleged breaches of loan covenants and representations and warranties, investors may request pnc to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans. indemnification and repurchase claims are often settled on an individual basis through make whole payments or loan repurchases, although we may also negotiate pooled settlements with investors. in connection with pooled settlements, we typically do not repurchase loans and the consummation of such transactions generally results in us no longer having indemnification and repurchase exposure with the investor in the transaction.
residential mortgage loan repurchase obligations while residential mortgage loans are sold on a non-recourse basis, we assume certain loan repurchase obligations associated with mortgage loans we have sold to investors. these loan repurchase obligations primarily relate to situations where pnc is alleged to have breached certain origination covenants and representations and warranties made to purchasers of the loans in the respective purchase and sale agreements. residential mortgage loans covered by these loan repurchase obligations include first and second-lien mortgage loans we have sold through agency securitizations, non-agency securitizations, and loan sale transactions. as discussed in note 2 loan sale and servicing activities and variable interest entities in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report, agency securitizations consist of mortgage loan sale transactions with fnma, fhlmc and the government national mortgage association (gnma), while non-agency securitizations consist of mortgage loan sale transactions with private investors. mortgage loan sale transactions that are not part of a securitization may involve fnma, fhlmc or private investors. our historical exposure and activity associated with agency securitization repurchase obligations has primarily been related to transactions with fnma and fhlmc, as indemnification and repurchase losses associated with fha and va-insured and uninsured loans pooled in gnma securitizations historically have been minimal. in addition to indemnification and repurchase risk, we face other risks of loss with respect to our participation in these programs, some of which are described in note 20 legal proceedings in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report with respect to governmental inquiries related to fha-insured loans. repurchase obligation activity associated with residential mortgages is reported in the residential mortgage banking segment.
origination and sale of residential mortgages is an ongoing business activity and, accordingly, management continually assesses the need to recognize indemnification and repurchase liabilities pursuant to the associated investor sale agreements. we establish indemnification and repurchase liabilities for estimated losses on sold first and second-lien mortgages for which indemnification is expected to be provided or for loans that are expected to be repurchased. for the first and second-lien mortgage sold portfolio, we have established an indemnification and repurchase liability pursuant to investor sale agreements based on claims made and our estimate of future claims on a loan by loan basis. to estimate the mortgage repurchase liability arising from breaches of representations and warranties, we consider the following factors: (i) borrower performance in our historically sold portfolio (both actual and estimated future defaults); (ii) the level of outstanding unresolved repurchase claims; (iii) estimated probable future repurchase claims, considering information about expected investor behaviors, delinquent and liquidated loans, resolved and unresolved mortgage insurance rescission notices and our historical experience with claim rescissions; (iv) the potential ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase claims (rescission rate); (v) the availability of legal defenses; and (vi) the estimated severity of loss upon repurchase of the loan or collateral, make-whole settlement or indemnification.
we previously reached agreements with both fnma and fhlmc to resolve their repurchase claims with respect to loans sold between 2000 and 2008. thus, our repurchase obligations involve agency securitizations and other loan sales with fnma and fhlmc subsequent to 2008 only, as well as agency securitizations with gnma and non-agency securitizations and other loan sales with private investors. the unpaid principal balance of loans associated with our exposure to repurchase obligations totaled $65.3 billion at december 31, 2015, of which $1.2 billion was 90 days or more delinquent. the comparative amounts were $68.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, at december 31, 2014.
we believe our indemnification and repurchase liability appropriately reflects the estimated probable losses on indemnification and repurchase claims for all residential mortgage loans sold and outstanding as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014. in making these estimates we consider the losses that we expect to incur over the life of the sold loans. see note 21 commitments and guarantees in this report for additional information on residential mortgage repurchase obligations.
home equity loan/line of credit repurchase obligations pncs repurchase obligations include obligations with respect to certain brokered home equity loans/lines of credit that were sold to a limited number of private investors in the financial services industry by national city prior to our acquisition of national city. pnc is no longer engaged in the brokered home equity lending business, and our exposure under these loan repurchase obligations is limited to repurchases of the loans sold in these transactions. repurchase activity associated with brokered home equity loans/lines of credit is reported in the non-strategic assets portfolio segment.
loan covenants and representations and warranties were established through loan sale agreements with various investors to provide assurance that loans pnc sold to the investors were of sufficient investment quality. key aspects of such covenants and representations and warranties include the loans compliance with any applicable loan criteria established for the transaction, including underwriting standards, delivery of all required loan documents to the investor or its designated party, sufficient collateral valuation, and the validity of the lien securing the loan. as a result of alleged breaches of these contractual obligations, investors may request pnc to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans.
68 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k payments or loan repurchases; however, on occasion we may negotiate pooled settlements with investors. in connection with pooled settlements, we typically do not repurchase loans and the consummation of such transactions generally results in us no longer having indemnification and repurchase exposure with the investor in the transaction.
an indemnification and repurchase liability for estimated losses for which indemnification is expected to be provided or for loans that are expected to be repurchased was established at the acquisition of national city. managements evaluation of these indemnification and repurchase liabilities is based upon trends in indemnification and repurchase claims, actual loss experience, risks in the underlying serviced loan portfolios, current economic conditions and the periodic negotiations that management may enter into with investors to settle existing and potential future claims.
indemnification and repurchase liabilities, which are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, are evaluated by management on a quarterly basis. initial recognition and subsequent adjustments to the indemnification are recognized in other noninterest income on the consolidated income statement. for more information regarding our home equity loan/line of credit repurchase obligations, see note 21 commitments and guarantees in the notes to consolidated statements in item  8 of this report.
risk management enterprise risk management pnc encounters risk as part of the normal course of operating our business. accordingly, we design risk management processes to help manage this risk. pnc manages risk in light of our risk appetite to optimize long term shareholder value while supporting our employees, customers, and communities.
this risk management section describes our risk framework, including risk appetite and strategy, culture, risk organization and governance, risk identification and quantification, risk controls and limits and risk monitoring and reporting. the overall risk management section of this item 7 also provides an analysis of our key areas of risk, which include but are not limited to credit, operational, compliance, market, liquidity and model. our use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within the risk management section.
pnc operates within a rapidly evolving regulatory environment. accordingly, we are actively focused on the timely adoption of regulatory pronouncements within our enterprise risk management (erm) framework.
risk appetite and strategy pncs risk appetite represents the organizations desired enterprise risk position, set within our capital-based risk and liquidity capacity to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans. reviewed periodically through the risk reporting and strategic planning processes, the risk appetite serves as an operating guide for making balanced risk decisions that support our business strategies; it will adjust over time to reflect the current and anticipated economic environment, growth objectives, risk capacity and our risk profile.
we establish guiding principles for each of the risks within our taxonomy to support the risk appetite statement. the guiding principles are qualitative statements that guide risk-taking activities and are supported by quantitative metrics, risk limits, and risk appetite descriptions as defined in policy and managed through the erm framework.
risk culture all employees are considered risk managers, and are responsible for understanding pncs risk appetite statement, guiding principles and erm framework and how they apply to their respective roles. pncs governance structure establishes clear roles and responsibilities for risk management throughout the organization. all employees are encouraged to collaborate across groups to identify and mitigate risks and elevate issues as required. pnc reinforces risk management responsibilities through a performance management system where employee performance goals include risk management objectives and incentives for employees to reinforce balanced measures of risk adjusted performance.
proactive communication, between groups and up to the board of directors, facilitates timely identification and resolution of risk issues. pncs multi-level risk committee structure provides a formal channel to identify, decision, and report risk. risk the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k 69
committee membership includes representatives from business and risk stakeholder groups that are responsible for helping ensure risk issues are proactively identified, decisioned, monitored, communicated and managed appropriately within the risk management framework.
risk organization and governance pnc employs a comprehensive risk management governance framework to help ensure that risks are identified, balanced decisions are made that consider risk and return, and risks are adequately monitored and managed. risk committees established within this governance framework provide oversight for risk management activities at the board, corporate, and business levels. committee composition is designed to provide effective oversight balanced across the three lines of defense in accordance with the occs heightened risk management and governance expectations and guidelines. see further discussion in the supervision and regulation section in item 1 of this report.
business front line units (bflu)  as the first line of defense, business front line units are accountable for identifying, owning and managing risks to within acceptable levels while adhering to the risk management framework established by independent risk management. our businesses strive to enhance risk management and internal control processes. integrated and comprehensive processes are designed to adequately identify, measure, manage, monitor and report risks which may significantly impact each business.
independent risk management (irm)  as the second line of defense, irm oversees risk management and establishes standards at the enterprise level to support business management in meeting their responsibilities for managing risk. irm is independent from bflus and is responsible for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling aggregate risks.
internal audit  as the third line of defense, internal audit is independent from bflus and irm and develops a risk based audit program to provide assurance on the management of risk throughout the organization. this includes auditing business processes across the organization and reporting on the effectiveness of controls, as well as auditing the risk management policy and infrastructure implemented by irm.
within the three lines of defense, the risk organization has sufficient authority to influence material decisions. the board oversees enterprise risk management of pnc for any material changes to the risk profile and periodically reviews core elements of enterprise risk including the risk appetite statement, risk capacity, appetite and strategy, and risk controls and limits.
we use our governance structure to assess the effectiveness of our risk management practices on an ongoing basis, based on how we manage our day-to-day business activities and on our development and execution of more specific strategies to mitigate risks. specific responsibilities include:
board of directors  the board oversees enterprise risk management. the risk committee of the board of directors evaluates pncs risk appetite, managements assessment of the enterprise risk profile, and the enterprise-wide risk structure and processes established by management to identify, measure, monitor, and manage risk. the audit committee of the board also has responsibility for select areas of risk (e.g., financial reporting, ethics and internal controls over financial reporting).
corporate committees  the corporate committees are responsible for overseeing risk standards and strategies, recommending risk limits, policies and metrics, monitoring risk exposures, reviewing risk profiles and key risk issues, and approving significant transactions and initiatives. at the management level, pnc has established several senior management-level committees to facilitate the review, evaluation, and management of risk. the management-level executive committee (ec) is the corporate committee that is responsible for developing enterprise-wide strategy and achieving pncs strategic objectives. the ec evaluates risk management, in part, by monitoring risk reporting from the other corporate committees, which are the supporting committees for ec.
working committees  the working committees are generally subcommittees of the corporate committees and include risk management committees for each of pncs major businesses or functions. working committees are intended to define, design and develop the risk management framework, including risk appetite, at the business or function level. the working committees help to implement key enterprise-level activities within a business or function. these committees recommend risk management policies for the business or function that are consistent with the enterprise-wide risk management objectives and policies. the business level committees are also responsible for approving significant initiatives under a certain threshold.
policies and procedures  pnc has established risk management policies and procedures to provide direction, guidance, and clarity on roles and responsibilities to management and the board of directors. these policies and procedures are organized in a multi-tiered framework and require periodic review and approval by relevant committees within the governance structure.
70 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k risk identification and quantification risk identification takes place across a variety of risk types throughout the organization. these risk types consist of, but are not limited to, credit, operational, compliance, market, liquidity and model. risks are identified based on a balanced use of analytical tools and management judgment for both on- and off-balance sheet exposures. our governance structure supports risk identification by facilitating assessment of key risk issues, emerging risks, and idiosyncratic risks and implementation of mitigation strategies as appropriate. these risks are prioritized based on quantitative and qualitative analysis and assessed against the risk appetite. multiple tools and approaches are used to help identify and prioritize risks, including risk appetite metrics, key risk indicators (kris), key performance indicators (kpis), risk control and self-assessments (rcsas), scenario analysis, stress testing and special investigations.
risks are aggregated and assessed within and across risk functions or businesses. the aggregated risk information is reviewed and reported at an enterprise level for adherence to the risk appetite framework as established through the policy framework and approved by the board of directors or by appropriate managing committees. this enterprise aggregation and reporting approach promotes the identification and appropriate escalation of material risks across the organization and supports an understanding of the cumulative impact of risk in relation to our risk appetite.
risk control and limits risk controls and limits provide the linkage from pncs risk appetite statement and associated guiding principles to the risk taking activities of our businesses. risk limits are quantitative measures, including forward looking assumptions, which allocate the firms aggregate risk appetite statement to lines of business and functional risk areas. they are established within policy across risk categories and are embedded within each risk appetite description.
when setting risk limits, pnc considers major risks, aligns with the established risk appetite, balances risk-reward, leverages analytics including stressed scenarios along with historical data, and adjusts limits in a timely manner in response to changes in internal and external environments. quantitative and qualitative operating guidelines support risk limits and serve as an early warning system for potential violations of the limits. these operating guidelines trigger mitigation strategies and management escalation protocols if limits are breached.
pncs control structure is balanced in terms of efficiency and effectiveness with the risks that we are willing to take, as defined by our risk appetite. controls are in place across the risk taxonomy to monitor established risk limits.
pnc uses a multi-tiered risk policy, procedure, and committee charter framework to provide direction and guidance for identifying, decisioning, monitoring, communicating and managing risk, including appropriate processes to escalate control parameter exceptions when applicable.
risk monitoring and reporting pnc uses similar tools to monitor and report risk when performing risk identification. these tools include risk appetite metrics, kris, kpis, rcsas, scenario analysis, stress testing and special investigations.
the risk identification and quantification processes, the risk control and limits reviews, and the tools used for risk monitoring provide the basis for risk reporting. the objective of risk reporting is comprehensive risk aggregation and transparent communication of aggregated risks, issues, risk level compared to appetite, outlook as well as mitigation strategies where appropriate, to the risk committee of the board of directors, corporate committees, working committees and other designated parties for effective decision making.
risk reports are produced at the line of business, functional risk and the enterprise levels. the enterprise level risk report aggregates risks identified in the functional and business reports to define the enterprise risk profile. the enterprise risk profile is a point-in-time assessment of enterprise risk. the risk profile represents pncs overall risk position in relation to the desired enterprise risk appetite and overall risk capacity. the determination of the enterprise risk profile is based on analysis of quantitative reporting of risk limits and other measures along with qualitative assessments. quarterly aggregation of our risk profile enables a clear view of our risk level relative to our quantitative risk appetite and overall risk capacity. the enterprise level report is provided through the governance structure to the board of directors.
credit risk management credit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. credit risk is one of our most significant risks. our processes for managing credit risk are embedded in pncs risk culture and in our decision-making processes using a systematic approach whereby credit risks and related exposures are identified and assessed, managed through specific policies and processes, measured and evaluated against our risk appetite and credit concentration limits, and reported, along with specific mitigation activities, to management and the board through our governance structure.
asset quality overview asset quality trends improved overall during 2015.
                                                     nonperforming assets at december 31, 2015 decreased $455 million compared with december 31, 2014 as a result of improvements in both consumer lending and commercial lending nonperforming loans. consumer lending nonperforming loans decreased $303 million and commercial lending nonperforming loans decreased $81 million. nonperforming assets were 0.68% of total assets at december 31,
2015 compared with 0.83% at december 31, 2014.
                                                        overall loan delinquencies totaled $1.6 billion at december 31, 2015, a decrease of $306 million, or 16%, from year-end 2014. the reduction was due in large part to a reduction in accruing government insured residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more of $174 million, the majority of which we took possession of and conveyed the real estate, or are in the process of conveyance and claim resolution.
   provision for credit losses for the year ended december 31, 2015 declined to $255 million compared to $273 million for the year ended december 31, 2014.
   the level of alll decreased to $2.7 billion at december 31, 2015 as compared to $3.3 billion at december 31, 2014, primarily due to a change to our derecognition policy effective december 31, 2015 for purchased impaired pooled consumer and residential real estate loans.
nonperforming assets and loan delinquencies nonperforming assets, including oreo and foreclosed assets nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of contractual principal and interest is not probable and include nonperforming troubled debt restructurings (tdrs), oreo and foreclosed assets. loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans, purchased impaired loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. additional information regarding our nonperforming loans and nonaccrual policies is included in note 1 accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report. a summary of the major categories of nonperforming assets are presented in table 28. see note 3 asset quality in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further detail of nonperforming asset categories.
(a)   excludes most consumer loans and lines of credit, not secured by residential real estate, which are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and are not placed on nonperforming status.
(d)   the december 31, 2015 ratio was impacted by the change in derecognition policy for purchased impaired pooled consumer and residential real estate loans as of december 31, 2015. for additional information see note 4 purchased loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
principal activity, including paydowns and payoffs              (687   )             (1,001   )
nonperforming assets decreased $455 million at december 31, 2015 compared to december 31, 2014. consumer lending nonperforming loans decreased $303 million and commercial lending nonperforming loans decreased $81 million. as of december 31, 2015, approximately 90% of total nonperforming loans were secured by collateral which lessens reserve requirements and is expected to reduce credit losses in the event of default. as of december 31, 2015, commercial lending nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 62% of their unpaid principal balance, due to charge-offs recorded to date, before consideration of the alll. see note 3 asset quality in the
72 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information on these loans.
within consumer nonperforming loans, residential real estate tdrs comprise 68% of total residential real estate nonperforming loans at december 31, 2015, up from 60% at december 31, 2014. home equity tdrs comprise 51% of home equity nonperforming loans at december 31, 2015, down from 54% at december 31, 2014. tdrs generally remain in nonperforming status until a borrower has made at least six consecutive months of both principal and interest payments under the modified terms or ultimate resolution occurs. loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to pnc and loans to borrowers not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status.
at december 31, 2015, our largest nonperforming asset was $33 million in the real estate, rental and leasing industry and our average nonperforming loan associated with commercial lending was less than $1 million. the ten largest outstanding nonperforming assets are from the commercial lending portfolio and represent 37% and 8% of total commercial lending nonperforming loans and total nonperforming assets, respectively, as of december 31, 2015.
purchased impaired loans are considered performing, even if contractually past due (or if we do not expect to receive payment in full based on the original contractual terms), as we accrete interest income over the expected life of the loans. the accretable yield represents the excess of the expected cash flows on the loans at the measurement date over the carrying value. generally decreases, other than interest rate decreases for variable rate notes, in the net present value of expected cash flows of individual commercial or pooled purchased impaired loans would result in an impairment charge to the provision for credit losses in the period in which the change is deemed probable. generally increases in the net present value first result in a recovery of previously recorded allowance for loan losses, to the extent applicable, and then an increase to accretable yield for the remaining life of the purchased impaired loans. total nonperforming loans and assets in the tables above are significantly lower than they would have been due to this accounting treatment for purchased impaired loans. this treatment also results in a lower ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans and a higher ratio of alll to nonperforming loans. see note 4 purchased loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report, for additional information, including the accounting treatment, on these loans.
loan delinquencies we regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels may be a key indicator of loan portfolio asset quality. measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. loan delinquencies exclude loans held for sale and purchased impaired loans, but include government insured or guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option.
accruing loans past due 90 days or more decreased $224 million, or 20%, at december 31, 2015 compared to december 31, 2014 due to declines in government insured residential real estate loans of $174 million, the majority of which we took possession of and conveyed the real estate, or are in the process of conveyance and claim resolution. accruing loans past due 90 days or more are referred to as late stage loan delinquencies. these loans are not included in nonperforming loans and continue to accrue interest because they are well secured by collateral and are in the process of collection, or are managed in homogenous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines, or are certain government insured or guaranteed loans.
on a regular basis our special asset committee closely monitors loans, primarily commercial loans, that are not included in the nonperforming or accruing past due categories and for which we are uncertain about the borrowers ability to comply with existing repayment terms. these loans totaled $.1 billion and $.2 billion at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively.
see note 1 accounting policies and note 3 asset quality in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information regarding our nonperforming loan and nonaccrual policies and further information on loan delinquencies.
home equity loan portfolio our home equity loan portfolio totaled $32.1 billion as of december 31, 2015, or 16% of the total loan portfolio. of that total, $18.8 billion, or 59%, was outstanding under primarily variable-rate home equity lines of credit and $13.3 billion, or 41%, consisted of closed-end home equity installment loans. approximately 4% of the home equity portfolio was purchased impaired and 3% of the home equity portfolio was on nonperforming status as of december 31, 2015.
as of december 31, 2015, we are in an originated first lien position for approximately 53% of the total outstanding portfolio and, where originated as a second lien, we currently hold or service the first lien position for an additional 2% of the portfolio. the remaining 45% of the portfolio was secured by second liens where we do not hold the first lien position. the credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we are in, hold or service the first lien position, is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien.
lien position information is generally based upon original ltv at the time of origination. however, after origination pnc is not typically notified when a senior lien position that is not held by pnc is satisfied. therefore, information about the current lien status of junior lien loans is less readily available in cases where pnc does not also hold the senior lien. additionally, pnc is not typically notified when a junior lien position is added after origination of a pnc first lien. this updated information for both junior and senior liens must be obtained from external sources, and therefore, pnc has contracted with an industry-leading third-party service provider to obtain updated loan, lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources.
we track borrower performance monthly, including obtaining original ltvs, updated fico scores at least quarterly, updated ltvs semi-annually, and other credit metrics at least quarterly, including the historical performance of any mortgage loans regardless of lien position that we do or do not hold. this information is used for internal reporting and risk management. for internal reporting and risk management we also segment the population into pools based on product type (e.g., home equity loans, brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, brokered home equity lines of credit). as part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the home equity portfolio based upon the loan delinquency, modification status and bankruptcy status, as well as the delinquency, modification status and bankruptcy status of any mortgage loan with the same borrower (regardless of whether it is a first lien senior to our second lien).
in establishing our alll for non-impaired loans, we primarily utilize a delinquency roll-rate methodology for pools of loans. in accordance with accounting principles, under this methodology, we establish our allowance based upon incurred losses, not lifetime expected losses. the roll-rate methodology estimates transition/roll of loan balances from one delinquency state (e.g., 30-59 days past due) to another delinquency state (e.g., 60-89 days past due) and ultimately to charge-off. the roll through to charge-off is based on pncs actual loss experience for each type of pool. each of our home equity pools contains both first and second liens. our experience has been that the ratio of first to second lien loans has been consistent over time and the charge-off amounts for the pools, used to establish our allowance, include losses on both first and second liens loans.
generally, our variable-rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period, followed by a 20-year amortization term. during the draw period, we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay either interest or principal and interest. we view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only, as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments. the risk associated with the borrowers ability to satisfy the loan terms upon the draw period ending is considered in

(a)   includes all home equity lines of credit that mature in 2016 or later, including those with borrowers where we have terminated borrowing privileges.
(b)   includes approximately $40 million, $48 million, $34 million, $26 million and $534 million of home equity lines of credit with balloon payments, including those where we have terminated borrowing privileges, with draw periods scheduled to end in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and thereafter, respectively.
based upon outstanding balances, and excluding purchased impaired loans, at december 31, 2015, for home equity lines of credit for which the borrower can no longer draw (e.g., draw period has ended or borrowing privileges have been terminated), approximately 3% were 30-89 days past due and approximately 5% were 90 days or more past due. generally, when a borrower becomes 60 days past due, we terminate borrowing privileges and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated. at that point, we continue our collection/recovery processes, which may include loan modification resulting in a loan that is classified as a tdr.
see note 3 asset quality in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information.
auto loan portfolio the auto loan portfolio totaled $11.2 billion as of december 31, 2015, or 5% of our total loan portfolio. of that total, $9.6 billion resides in the indirect auto portfolio, $1.1 billion in the direct auto portfolio, and $.5 billion in acquired or securitized portfolios, which has been declining as no pools have been recently acquired. the indirect auto portfolio is the largest segment and generates auto loan applications from franchised automobile dealers. this business is strategically aligned with our core retail business.
the auto loan portfolios performance is measured monthly, including updated collateral values that are obtained monthly and updated fico scores that are obtained at least quarterly. for internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the portfolio by product channel and product type, and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience. as part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the portfolio by loan structure, collateral attributes, and credit metrics which include fico score, loan-to-value and term.
see note 3 asset quality in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information.
loan modifications and troubled debt restructurings consumer loan modifications we modify loans under government and pnc-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure, where appropriate. initially, a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program. if a borrower does not qualify under a government program, the borrower is then evaluated under a pnc program. our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate, extend the term and/or defer principal. loans that are either temporarily or permanently modified under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as tdrs. further, loans that have certain types of payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as tdrs. additional detail on tdrs is discussed below as well as in note 3 asset quality in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
a temporary modification, with a term between 3 and 24 months, involves a change in original loan terms for a period the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k 75
of time and reverts to a calculated exit rate for the remaining term of the loan as of a specific date. a permanent modification, with a term greater than 24 months, is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed. permanent modification programs, including both government-created home affordable modification program (hamp) and pnc-developed modification programs, generally result in principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, term extension, capitalization of past due amounts, interest only period or deferral of principal.
we also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our borrowers and servicing customers needs while mitigating credit losses. table 33 provides the number of bank-owned accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer real estate related loans at the end of each year presented.

(a)   all temporary modifications are home equity loans.
in addition to temporary loan modifications, we may make available to a borrower a payment plan or a hamp trial payment period. under a payment plan or a hamp trial payment period, there is no change to the loans contractual terms so the borrower remains legally responsible for payment of the loan under its original terms.
payment plans may include extensions, re-ages and/or forbearance plans. all payment plans bring an account current once certain requirements are achieved and are primarily intended to demonstrate a borrowers renewed willingness and ability to re-pay. due to the short term nature of the payment plan, there is a minimal impact to the alll.
under a hamp trial payment period, we establish an alternate payment, generally at an amount less than the contractual payment amount, for the borrower during this short time period. this allows a borrower to demonstrate successful payment performance before permanently restructuring the loan into a hamp modification. subsequent to successful borrower performance under the trial payment period, we will capitalize the original contractual amount past due, to include accrued interest and fees receivable, and restructure the loans contractual terms, along with bringing the restructured account current. as the borrower is often already delinquent at the time of participation in the hamp trial payment period, generally enrollment in the program does not significantly increase the alll. if the trial payment period is unsuccessful, the loan will be evaluated for further action based upon our existing policies.
commercial loan modifications and payment plans modifications of terms for commercial loans are based on individual facts and circumstances. commercial loan modifications may involve reduction of the interest rate, extension of the loan term and/or forgiveness of principal. modified commercial loans are usually already nonperforming prior to modification. we evaluate these modifications for tdr classification based upon whether we granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. additional detail on tdrs is discussed below as well as in note 3 asset quality in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
76 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k troubled debt restructurings a tdr is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. tdrs result from our loss mitigation activities and include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and extensions, which are intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. additionally, tdrs also result from borrowers that have been discharged from personal liability through chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to pnc.

tdrs that are performing, including credit card loans, are excluded from nonperforming loans. these tdrs remained generally flat during 2015 at $1.2 billion. generally, the accruing category is comprised of loans where borrowers have been performing under the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months. loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to pnc and loans to borrowers not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status.

total net charge-offs are lower than they would have been otherwise due to the accounting treatment for purchased impaired loans. this treatment also results in a lower ratio of net charge-offs to average loans. see note 4 purchased loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information on net charge-offs related to these loans.
we maintain an alll to absorb losses from the loan and lease portfolio and determine this allowance based on quarterly assessments of the estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio. our total alll of $2.7 billion at december 31, 2015 consisted of $1.6 billion and $1.1 billion established for the commercial lending and consumer lending categories, respectively. we maintain the alll at a level that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. the reserve calculation and determination process is dependent on the use of key assumptions. key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan and lease portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower, and economic conditions. key reserve assumptions are periodically updated.
we establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using methods prescribed by gaap. all impaired loans are subject to individual analysis, except leases and large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans which may include, but are not limited to, credit card, residential real estate secured and consumer installment loans. specific allowances for individual loans (including commercial and consumer tdrs) are determined based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows from the loans discounted at their effective interest rate, observable market price or the fair value of the underlying collateral.
reserves allocated to non-impaired commercial loan classes are based on pd and lgd credit risk ratings.
our commercial pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as pd and lgd. the results of these parameters are then applied to the loan balance and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit to determine the amount of the respective reserves. our pds and lgds are primarily determined using internal commercial loan loss data. this internal data is supplemented with third-party data and management judgment, as deemed necessary. we continue to evaluate and enhance our use of internal commercial loss data and will periodically update our pds and lgds as well as consider third-party data, regulatory guidance and management judgment.
the majority of the commercial portfolio is secured by collateral, including loans to asset-based lending customers, which generally demonstrate lower lgd compared to loans not secured by collateral. additionally, guarantees on loans greater than $1 million and owner guarantees for small business loans do not significantly impact our alll.
a portion of the alll is related to qualitative and measurement factors. these factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:
   industry concentrations and conditions,
   recent credit quality trends,
   timing of available information, including the performance of first lien positions, and
   limitations of available historical data.
pncs determination of the alll for non-impaired loans is sensitive to the risk grades assigned to commercial loans and loss rates for consumer loans. there are several other qualitative and quantitative factors considered in determining the alll. this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the alll. it is intended to provide insight into the impact of adverse changes to risk grades and loss rates only and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk ratings or loss rates. given the current processes used, we believe the risk grades and loss rates currently assigned are appropriate. in the hypothetical event that the aggregate weighted average commercial loan risk grades would experience a 1% deterioration, assuming all other variables remain constant, the allowance for commercial loans would increase by approximately $44 million as of december 31, 2015. in the hypothetical event that consumer loss rates would increase by 10%, assuming all other variables remain constant, the allowance for consumer loans would increase by approximately $24 million at december 31, 2015.
purchased impaired loans are initially recorded at fair value and applicable accounting guidance prohibits the carry over or creation of valuation allowances at acquisition. because the initial fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component, additional reserves are established when performance is expected to be worse than our expectations as of the acquisition date. at december 31, 2015, we had established reserves of $.3 billion for purchased impaired loans. in addition, loans (purchased impaired and non-impaired) acquired after january 1, 2009 were recorded at fair value. no allowance for loan losses was carried over and no allowance was created at the date of acquisition. see note 4 purchased loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information.
in determining the appropriateness of the alll, we make specific allocations to impaired loans and allocations to portfolios of commercial and consumer loans. we also allocate reserves to provide coverage for probable losses incurred in the portfolio at the balance sheet date based upon current market conditions, which may not be reflected in historical loss data. commercial lending is the largest category of credits and is sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the alll. we have allocated approximately $1.6 billion, or 59%, of the alll at december 31, 2015 to the commercial lending category. consumer lending allocations are made based on historical loss experience adjusted for recent activity. approximately $1.1 billion, or 41%, of the alll at december 31, 2015 has been allocated to these consumer lending categories.
in addition to the alll, we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. we report this allowance as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. we maintain the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at a level we believe is appropriate to absorb estimated probable losses on these unfunded credit facilities. we determine this amount using
78 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures. other than the estimation of the probability of funding, this methodology is very similar to the one we use for determining our alll.
we refer you to note 1 accounting policies and note 3 asset quality in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further information on certain key asset quality indicators that we use to evaluate our portfolios and establish the allowances.

(a)                                         a portion of the alll associated with purchased impaired pooled consumer and residential real estate loans was derecognized on december 31, 2015 due to the change in the derecognition policy for these loans. the december 31, 2015 ratio of alll to total loans was impacted by the derecognition. for additional information see note 4 purchased loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
the provision for credit losses decreased to $255 million for 2015 compared to $273 million for 2014 due to improved credit quality. for 2015, the provision for commercial lending credit losses decreased by $45 million, or 45%, from 2014. the provision for consumer lending credit losses increased $27 million, or 16%, from 2014.
at december 31, 2015, total alll to total nonperforming loans was 128%. the comparable amount for december 31, 2014 was 133%. these ratios are 98% and 85%, respectively, when excluding the $.6 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, of alll at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 allocated to consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by residential real estate and purchased impaired loans. we have excluded consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by real estate as they are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and not placed on nonperforming status. additionally, we have excluded purchased impaired loans as they are considered performing regardless of their delinquency status as interest is accreted in accordance with asc 310-30 based on the recorded investment balance. additional allowance is recorded when the net present value of expected cash flows is lower than the recorded investment balance. see table 28 within this credit risk management section for additional information.
the alll balance increases or decreases across periods in relation to fluctuating risk factors, including asset quality trends, net charge-offs and changes in aggregate portfolio balances. the alll balance declined $.6 billion, or 18%, as of december 31, 2015 compared to december 31, 2014. during 2015, the decline was driven by improved asset quality trends, including, but not limited to, delinquency status and improving economic conditions, as well as reduced net charge-offs, coupled with the derecognition of $468 million of alll related to purchased impaired pooled consumer and residential real estate loans. these impacts to alll were partially offset by continued portfolio growth over the recent quarters.
see note 1 accounting policies and note 4 purchased loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report regarding changes in the alll and in the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit.
operational risk management operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human factors, or external events. this includes losses that may arise as a result of non-compliance with laws or regulations, failure to fulfill fiduciary responsibilities, as well as litigation or other legal actions. operational risk may occur in any of our business activities and manifests itself in various ways, including but not limited to:
   material disruption in business activities,
   system breaches and misuse of sensitive information,
pncs operational risk management is inclusive of technology risk management and business continuity risk. enterprise compliance is responsible for coordinating the compliance risk component of pncs operational risk framework. operational risk management focuses on balancing business needs, regulatory expectations and risk management priorities through an adaptive and proactive program that is designed to provide a strong governance the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k 79
the pnc board determines the strategic approach to operational risk via establishment of guiding principles, risk appetite and appropriate risk management structure. this includes establishment of risk metrics and limits and operational risk committee hierarchy and reporting structure to identify, understand and manage operational risks.
executive management has responsibility for operational risk management. the executive management team is responsible for monitoring significant risks, key controls and related issues through management reporting and a governance structure of risk committees, to help ensure that objectives are pursued within the bounds of our risk appetite.
within the independent risk management function, operational risk management (orm) is responsible for developing and maintaining the policies, methodologies, tools, and technology utilized across the enterprise to identify, assess, monitor, and report operational risks. orm monitors enterprise-wide adherence with related policies and procedures and regularly assesses overall program effectiveness. in addition, orm independently challenges the results and conclusions generated by the business units during the execution of the operational risk management program.
business unit management is responsible for the day-to-day management of operational risks inherent in the products, services, and activities for which they are responsible. business unit management is also responsible for adhering to pncs enterprise-wide operational risk management policies and procedures including regularly identifying, measuring, and monitoring operational risks in their respective areas, as well as capturing, analyzing and reporting operational risks and issues.
management of operational risk is based upon a comprehensive framework designed to enable pnc to determine the enterprise and individual business units operational risk profile in comparison to the established risk appetite and identify operational risks that may require further mitigation. this framework is established around a set of enterprise-wide policies and a system of internal controls that are designed to manage risk and to provide management with timely and accurate information about the operations of pnc. this framework employs a number of techniques to manage operational risk, including:
                                  risk and control self assessments (rcsas) that are performed at least annually across pncs businesses, processes, systems and products. rcsa methodology is a standard process for business units to document and assess operational risks, evaluate key control design and operating effectiveness, and determine if control enhancements are required,
                                                    a scenario analysis program that is leveraged to proactively evaluate operational risks with the potential for severe business, financial, operational or regulatory impact on the company or a major business unit. this methodology leverages standard processes and tools to evaluate a wide range of business and operational risks encompassing both external and internal events relevant to the company.
based upon scenario analysis conclusions, management may implement additional controls or risk management activities to reduce exposure to an acceptable level,
                                                    a metrics and key risk indicator framework that allows management to proactively monitor and assess shifts in operational risk exposure or key control effectiveness compared to expectations and thresholds. enterprise-level operational risk appetite metrics support pncs operational risk management framework and guiding principles with the objective of maintaining a risk profile within risk appetite. a broad set of operational risk indicators are in place to monitor and report exposures across the different inherent operational risk types. lastly, business-specific risk indicators are established to monitor the most significant risks and controls identified in the individual risk and control self assessments, and
                                                 operational loss events as well as technology and operational breakdowns that do not result in direct loss (near miss events) across the enterprise are continuously captured and maintained in a central repository. this information is analyzed and used to help determine the root causes of these events and to identify trends that could indicate changes in the companys risk exposure or control effectiveness. pncs external loss event program utilizes a number of sources to monitor and identify external loss events occurring across the financial services industry. relevant external events are evaluated by appropriate business and risk management personnel to determine whether pnc is exposed to similar events, and if so, whether appropriate controls are in place.
we continue to refine our methodology to estimate capital requirements for operational risk using a proprietary version of an advanced measurement approach (ama) as prescribed in basel ii. under the ama, the results of the program elements described above are key inputs directly incorporated into the capital calculation methodology.
risk professionals from operational risk, technology risk management, compliance and legal work closely with business areas to evaluate risks and challenge that appropriate key controls are established prior to the introduction of new or enhanced products, services and technologies. these risk
80 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k professionals also challenge business units design and implementation of mitigation strategies to address risks and issues identified through ongoing assessment and monitoring activities.
pncs technology risk management (trm) program is aligned with the operational risk framework. technology risk represents the risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of technology within an enterprise.
management of technology risk is embedded into the culture and decision-making processes of pnc through an information and technology risk management framework designed to help ensure secure, sound, and compliant it systems and infrastructure in support of business strategies and goals. the management of technology risk is a core business skill and an integral part of day-to-day activity.
cybersecurity is a principal concern for financial institutions and is a very high priority for pnc. the ever changing and complex threat landscape is closely monitored and pnc participates in proactive information sharing with intelligence sources, law enforcement, and the private sector. the cyber security program is based on a continuous improvement strategy by assessing current and emerging threats to protect our critical business functions, as well as the integrity, privacy, and confidentiality of data. we continue to strengthen our controls, processes and systems to help protect our networks, computers, software, and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access. see item 1a risk factors in this report for additional information regarding the risk of a material adverse impact from interruptions in the effective operation of, or security breaches affecting, those systems.
managers and staff at all levels are responsible for applying risk management policies, procedures, and strategies in their areas of responsibility. pncs trm function supports enterprise management of technology risk by independently assessing technology and information security risks, and by serving in an oversight role by measuring, monitoring, and challenging enterprise technology capabilities. specifically, technology risk management has the following objectives:
   technology risks related to ongoing business and operational activities are identified, assessed, and monitored,
   technology risks related to new key initiatives are assessed and appropriately managed, and
   emerging technology risks are monitored and assessed to verify their potential impact to pncs overall risk profile.
to support pncs overall risk profile within risk appetite and the enterprise risk appetite statement, technology risk management has established governance, operating structures, metrics, and guiding principles designed to ensure that technology risk is distinctly considered in business activities and strategic decision making processes.
pnc has defined an enterprise-wide business continuity program that provides structure and guidelines to ensure resiliency and recovery of pncs facilities, employees, suppliers and technology should there be a business disruption. it is a comprehensive program based upon a life cycle containing repeatable activities to identify and mitigate internal and external business disruptive threats. it is the responsibility of pncs business units to execute and comply with the business continuity program. the program is administered by a separate group, with governance and oversight being provided by additional resources in the independent risk management function.
pncs corporate insurance group is responsible for managing insurance risk across the organization, and is aligned within the enterprise risk management governance framework. pnc retains select corporate risks through its wholly-owned captive insurance company alpine indemnity limited, and transfers excess risk through the purchase of insurance where appropriate, to mitigate the effects of operational loss events. pncs risks associated with its participation as an insurer for these programs are mitigated through policy and annual aggregate limits. decisions surrounding pncs retention of its operating risks through deductibles or captive participation are made in conjunction with the enterprise risk management governance framework.
the corporate insurance group monitors and manages insurable risks through a combination of risk mitigation, retention and transfer consistent with the organizations risk appetite and philosophy. to ensure the lines of business have a clear understanding of insurance risk and the ability to retain or transfer risk, management holds regular meetings with the lines of business regarding risk evaluation and the utilization of insurance as a risk transfer technique. furthermore, corporate insurance management and the insurance risk committee have primary oversight of reporting insurance related activities through the governance structure that allows management to fully vet risk information.
quarterly, an enterprise operational risk report is developed to report key operational risks to senior management and the board of directors. the report encompasses key operational risk management conclusions, including the overall operational risk level, risk management effectiveness and outlook, grounded in quantitative measures and qualitative factors. key enterprise operational risks are also included in the enterprise risk report. in addition, operational risk is an integrated part of the quarterly business-specific risk reports.
compliance risk enterprise compliance is responsible for coordinating the compliance risk component of pncs operational risk framework. compliance issues are identified and tracked through enterprise-wide monitoring and tracking programs. key compliance risk issues are escalated through a comprehensive risk reporting process at both a business and enterprise level and incorporated, as appropriate, into the development and assessment of the firms operational risk profile. the compliance, conflicts & ethics policy committee, chaired by the chief compliance officer, provides oversight for compliance, conflicts and ethics programs and strategies across pnc. this committee also oversees the compliance processes related to fiduciary and investment risk. in order to help understand, and where appropriate, proactively address emerging regulatory issues, enterprise compliance communicates regularly with various regulators with supervisory or regulatory responsibilities with respect to pnc, its subsidiaries or businesses and participates in forums focused on regulatory and compliance matters in the financial services industry.
risk professionals from operational risk, technology risk management, compliance and legal work closely with business areas to evaluate risks and challenge that appropriate key controls are established prior to the introduction of new or enhanced products, services and technologies. these risk professionals also challenge business units design and implementation of mitigation strategies to address risks and issues identified through ongoing assessment and monitoring activities.
model risk management pnc relies on quantitative models to measure risks, to estimate certain financial values, and to support or inform certain business decisions. models may be used in processes such as determining the pricing of various products, grading and granting loans, measuring interest rate risks and other market risks, predicting losses, and assessing capital adequacy, as well as to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items.
the model risk management group is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed, and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise. the model risk management group, a subcommittee of the enterprise risk management committee, oversees all aspects of model risk, including pncs compliance with regulatory requirements related to model risk management, and approves exceptions to policy when appropriate.
to better manage our business, our practices around the use of models, and to comply with regulatory guidance and requirements, we have policies and procedures in place that define our governance processes for assessing and controlling model risk. these processes focus on identifying, reporting and remediating any problems with the soundness, accuracy, improper use or operating environment of our models. we recognize that models must be monitored over time to ensure their continued accuracy and functioning, and our policies also address the type and frequency of performance monitoring that is appropriate according to the importance of each model. pnc also monitors key metrics designed to assess our level of model risk and its alignment with our risk appetite.
there are a number of practices we undertake to identify and control model risk. a primary consideration is that models be well understood by those who use them as well as by other parties. our policies require detailed written model documentation for significant models to assist in making their use transparent and understood by users, independent reviewers, and regulatory and auditing bodies. the documentation must include details on the data and methods used to develop each model, assumptions utilized within the model, an assessment of model performance and a description of model limitations and circumstances in which a model should not be relied upon.
it is important that models operate in a controlled environment where access to code or the ability to make changes is limited to those who are authorized to do so. additionally, proper back-up and recovery mechanisms are needed for the ongoing functioning of models. our use of independent model control reviewers aids in the evaluation of the existing control mechanisms to help ensure that controls are appropriate and are functioning properly.
liquidity risk management liquidity risk has two fundamental components. the first is potential loss assuming we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost. the second is the potential inability to operate our businesses because adequate contingent liquidity is not available. we manage liquidity risk at the consolidated company level (bank, parent company, and nonbank subsidiaries combined) to help ensure that we can
82 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal business as usual and stressful circumstances, and to help ensure that we maintain an appropriate level of contingent liquidity.
management monitors liquidity through a series of early warning indicators that may indicate a potential market, or pnc-specific, liquidity stress event. in addition, management performs a set of liquidity stress tests over multiple time horizons with varying levels of severity and maintains a contingency funding plan to address a potential stress event. in the most severe liquidity stress simulation, we assume that pncs liquidity position is under pressure, while the market in general is under systemic pressure. the simulation considers, among other things, the impact of restricted access to both secured and unsecured external sources of funding, accelerated run-off of customer deposits, valuation pressure on assets and heavy demand to fund contingent obligations. parent company liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet our parent company obligations over the succeeding 24-month period. liquidity-related risk limits are established within our enterprise liquidity management policy and supporting policies. management committees, including the asset and liability committee, and the board of directors and its risk committee regularly review compliance with key established limits.
in addition to these liquidity monitoring measures and tools described above, pnc also monitors its liquidity by reference to the lcr, a regulatory minimum liquidity requirement designed to ensure that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs over the course of a 30-day stress scenario. the lcr is calculated by dividing the amount of an institutions high quality, unencumbered liquid assets (hqla), as defined and calculated in accordance with the lcr rules, by its estimated net cash outflow, with net cash outflows determined by applying the assumed outflow factors in the lcr rules. the resulting quotient is expressed as a percentage. for pnc and pnc bank, the lcr became effective january 1, 2015. the minimum required lcr will be phased-in over a period of years. the minimum lcr that pnc and pnc bank were required to maintain was 80% in 2015 and such minimum increased to 90% in 2016. between january 1, 2016 and june 30, 2016, pnc and pnc bank are required to calculate the lcr on a month-end basis. effective july 1, 2016, pnc and pnc bank must begin calculating their respective lcr ratios on a daily basis.
we provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on pnc in the supervision and regulation section of item 1 business and item 1a risk factors of this report.
bank level liquidity  uses at the bank level, primary contractual obligations include funding loan commitments, satisfying deposit withdrawal requests and maturities and debt service related to bank borrowings. as of december 31, 2015, there were approximately $8.3 billion of bank borrowings with contractual maturities of less than one year, including $1.8 billion in borrowings from an affiliate. we also maintain adequate bank liquidity to meet future potential loan demand and provide for other business needs, as necessary.
bank level liquidity  sources our largest source of bank liquidity on a consolidated basis is the deposit base generated by our retail and commercial banking businesses. total deposits increased to $249.0 billion at december 31, 2015 from $232.2 billion at december 31, 2014, driven primarily by growth in savings and demand deposits. assets determined by pnc to be liquid (liquid assets) and unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to maintain our liquidity position. borrowed funds come from a diverse mix of short-term and long-term funding sources.
at december 31, 2015, our liquid assets consisted of short-term investments (federal funds sold, resale agreements, trading securities and interest-earning deposits with banks) totaling $33.6 billion and securities available for sale totaling $55.8 billion. the level of liquid assets fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. of our total liquid assets of $89.4 billion, we had $3.2 billion of securities available for sale and trading securities pledged as collateral to secure public and trust deposits, repurchase agreements and for other purposes. in addition to the liquid assets we pledged, $6.5 billion of securities held to maturity were also pledged as collateral for these purposes.
in addition to the customer deposit base, which has historically provided the single largest source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, the bank also obtains liquidity through the issuance of traditional forms of funding, including long-term debt (senior notes, subordinated debt and fhlb advances) and short-term borrowings (federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings).
under the 2014 bank note program, pnc bank may from time to time offer unsecured senior and subordinated notes with maturity dates more than nine months (in the case of senior notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated notes). on may 22, 2015, pnc bank increased the capacity of this program by $5.0 billion to a maximum aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding of $30.0 billion. the $30.0 billion of notes authorized to be issued and outstanding at any one time includes notes issued by pnc bank under the 2004 bank note program and those notes pnc bank has assumed through the acquisition of other banks, in each case for so long as such notes remain outstanding. the terms of the 2014 bank note program do not affect any of the bank notes issued prior to january 16, 2014. at december 31, 2015, pnc bank had $24.1 billion of notes outstanding under this program of which $17.9 billion was senior bank notes and $6.2 billion was subordinated bank notes. the following table details all issuances during 2015:

84 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k total senior and subordinated debt of pnc bank increased to $25.5 billion at december 31, 2015 from $17.5 billion at december 31, 2014 due to the following activity in the period.
calls and maturities            (.8   )
pnc bank is a member of the fhlb-pittsburgh and, as such, has access to advances from fhlb-pittsburgh secured generally by residential mortgage loans, other mortgage-related loans and commercial mortgage-backed securities. at december 31, 2015, our unused secured borrowing capacity was $19.4 billion with the fhlb-pittsburgh. total fhlb borrowings increased to $20.1 billion at december 31, 2015 from $20.0 billion at december  31, 2014 due to the following activity in the period.
calls and maturities            (2.1   )
the fhlb-pittsburgh also periodically provides standby letters of credit on behalf of pnc bank to secure certain public deposits. pnc bank began using standby letters of credit issued by the fhlb-pittsburgh for these purposes in response to the regulatory liquidity standards finalized during 2014. if the fhlb-pittsburgh is required to make payment for a beneficiarys draw, the payment amount is converted into a collateralized advance to pnc bank. at december 31, 2015, standby letters of credit issued on our behalf by the fhlb-pittsburgh totaled $5.3 billion.
pnc bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. as of december 31, 2015, there was $14 million outstanding under this program.
pnc bank can also borrow from the federal reserve bank discount window to meet short-term liquidity requirements. the federal reserve bank, however, is not viewed as the primary means of funding our routine business activities, but rather as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. these potential borrowings are secured by commercial loans. at december 31, 2015, our unused secured borrowing capacity was $14.4 billion with the federal reserve bank.
parent company liquidity as of december 31, 2015, available parent company liquidity totaled $4.6 billion. parent company liquidity is primarily held in short-term investments, the terms of which provide for the availability of cash in 31 days or less. investments with longer durations may also be acquired, but if so, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the maturity of parent company debt obligations.
parent company liquidity  uses the parent companys contractual obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. as of december 31, 2015, there were approximately $1.3 billion of parent company borrowings with contractual maturities of less than one year. additionally, the parent company maintains adequate liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to pnc shareholders, share repurchases, and acquisitions.
see balance sheet, liquidity and capital highlights in the executive summary section of this item 7 for information on our 2015 capital plan that was accepted by the federal reserve. our capital plan included a recommendation to increase the quarterly common stock dividend in the second quarter of 2015 and the ability to redeem the series k preferred stock, as further described below, and also included share repurchase programs of up to $2.875 billion for the five quarter period beginning in the second quarter of 2015. see the capital portion of the consolidated balance sheet review in this item 7 for more information on our share repurchase programs.
on april 2, 2015, consistent with our 2015 capital plan, our board of directors approved an increase to pncs quarterly common stock dividend from 48 cents per common share to 51 cents per common share beginning with the may 5, 2015 dividend payment.
on may 4, 2015, we redeemed $500 million of pncs fixed-to-floating rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series k, as well as all depositary shares representing interests therein. each depositary share represented a 1/10 interest in a share of the series k preferred stock. all 50,000 shares of series k preferred stock, as well as all 500,000 depositary shares representing interests therein, were redeemed. the redemption price was $10,000 per share of series k preferred stock equivalent to $1,000 per depositary share, plus declared and unpaid dividends up to but excluding the redemption date.

by the u.s. banking agencies, and final rules issued by the federal reserve that make certain modifications to the federal reserves capital planning and stress testing rules.
parent company liquidity  sources the principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends it receives from its subsidiary bank, which may be impacted by the following:
   bank-level capital needs,
there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a national bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries. the amount available for dividend payments by pnc bank to the parent company without prior regulatory approval was approximately $1.7 billion at december 31, 2015. see note 19 regulatory matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for a further discussion of these limitations. we provide additional information on certain contractual restrictions in note 16 equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
in addition to dividends from pnc bank, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments.
we can also generate liquidity for the parent company and pncs non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt and equity securities, including certain capital instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper.
total parent company senior and subordinated debt and hybrid capital instruments decreased to $7.5 billion at december 31, 2015 from $10.1 billion at december 31, 2014 due to the following activity in the period.
table 40: parent company senior and subordinated debt and hybrid capital instruments in billions   2015
maturities             (2.5   )
the parent company has the ability to offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. as of december 31, 2015, there were no issuances outstanding under this program.
status of credit ratings the cost and availability of short-term and long-term funding, as well as collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments, is influenced by pncs credit ratings.
in general, rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied government support. in addition, rating agencies themselves have been subject to scrutiny arising from the most recent financial crisis and could make or be required to make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices, particularly in response to legislative and regulatory changes. potential changes in the legislative and regulatory environment and the timing of those changes could impact our ratings, which as noted above, could impact our liquidity and financial condition. a decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access to the capital markets and/or increase the cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition.
in march 2015, moodys investors service (moodys) published a new bank ratings methodology which has been implemented on a global basis and includes assessment of expected loss ratings on instruments ranging from bank deposits to preferred stock. in the second quarter of 2015, moodys concluded its review for pnc and pnc bank under this new methodology. as a result, moodys upgraded pnc banks long-term deposit rating three notches to aa2, confirmed pnc banks senior debt and issuer ratings at a2, and confirmed pnc banks prime-1 short-term notes rating. the moodys rating outlook for pnc and pnc bank is stable.

at december 31, 2015, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $26 million, which represents a reserve for tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which ultimately may not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, this estimate has been excluded from the contractual obligations table. see note 18 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information.
our contractual obligations totaled $82.0 billion at december 31, 2014. the decrease in the comparison is primarily attributable to declines in borrowed funds and time deposits. see funding sources in the consolidated balance sheet review section of this item  7 for additional information regarding our funding sources.

(a)   other commitments are funding commitments that could potentially require performance in the event of demands by third parties or contingent events. loan commitments are reported net of syndications, assignments and participations.
(b)   commitments to extend credit, or net unfunded loan commitments, represent arrangements to lend funds or provide liquidity subject to specified contractual conditions.
(c)   includes $4.7 billion of standby letters of credit that support remarketing programs for customers variable rate demand notes.
(d)   reinsurance agreements are with third-party insurers related to insurance sold to or placed on behalf of our customers. balances represent estimates based on availability of financial information.
(e)   includes other commitments of $216 million that were not on our consolidated balance sheet. the remaining $750 million of other commitments were included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.
our total commitments were $154.9 billion at december 31, 2014. the increase in the comparison is primarily attributable to an increase in commitments to extend credit, partially offset by declines in reinsurance agreements and net outstanding standby letters of credit. see note 21 commitments and guarantees in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information related to our commitments.
market risk management market risk is the risk of a loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. we are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in the following activities, among others:
   traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans,
   equity and other investments and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors, and
   fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange activities, as a result of customer activities and securities underwriting.
we have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. market risk management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with established guidelines, and reporting significant risks in the business to the risk committee of the board.
market risk management  interest rate risk interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources. due to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.
asset and liability management centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our risk management policies, which are approved by managements asset and liability committee and the risk committee of the board.
sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014 follow:

(a)   given the inherent limitations in certain of these measurement tools and techniques, results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero.
in addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. table 45 reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two 12-month periods assuming (i) the pnc economists most likely rate forecast, (ii) implied market forward rates and (iii) yield curve slope flattening (a 100 basis point yield curve slope flattening between 1-month and ten-year rates superimposed on current base rates) scenario.

second year sensitivity           8.7   %         3.9   %            (5.5   )%
when forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business and the behavior of existing on- and off-balance sheet positions. these assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in tables 44 and 45 above. these simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at then current market rates. we
table 46: alternate interest rate scenarios: one year forward the fourth quarter 2015 interest sensitivity analyses indicate that our consolidated balance sheet is positioned to benefit from an increase in interest rates and an upward sloping interest rate yield curve. we believe that we have the deposit funding base and balance sheet flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing interest rates and market conditions.
market risk management  customer-related trading risk we engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers investing and hedging activities. these transactions, related hedges and the credit valuation adjustment (cva) related to our customer derivatives portfolio are marked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities. we do not engage in proprietary trading of these products.
we use value-at-risk (var) as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. we calculate a diversified var at a 95% confidence interval. var is used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors. a diversified var reflects empirical correlations across different asset classes.
to help ensure the integrity of the models used to calculate var for each portfolio and enterprise-wide, we use a process known as backtesting. the backtesting process consists of comparing actual observations of gains or losses against the var levels that were calculated at the close of the prior day.
this assumes that market exposures remain constant throughout the day and that recent historical market variability is a good predictor of future variability. our customer-related trading activity includes customer revenue and intraday hedging which helps to reduce losses, and may reduce the number of instances of actual losses exceeding the prior day var measure. there were seven instances during 2015 under our diversified var measure where actual losses exceeded the prior day var measure. in comparison, there were two such instance during 2014. we use a 500 day look back period for backtesting and include customer-related trading revenue.
table 47: enterprise-wide gains/losses versus value-at-risk customer-related trading revenue increased to $210 million for 2015 compared with $178 million for 2014. the increase was primarily due to higher derivative client sales revenues and market interest rate changes impacting credit valuations for customer-related derivatives.
market risk management  equity and other investment risk equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. in addition to extending credit, taking deposits, securities underwriting and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations and growth financings in a variety of industries. we also have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity and in debt and equity-oriented hedge funds. the economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets such as loan servicing rights are directly affected by changes in market factors.
the primary risk measurement for equity and other investments is economic capital. economic capital is a common measure of risk for credit, market and operational risk. it is an estimate of the potential value depreciation over a one year horizon commensurate with solvency expectations of the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k 89
an institution rated single-a by the credit rating agencies. given the illiquid nature of many of these types of investments, it can be a challenge to determine their fair values. see note 7 fair value in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information.
various pnc business units manage our equity and other investment activities. our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines.
a summary of our equity investments follows:

tax credit investments           2,254           2,616
private equity                   1,441           1,615
blackrock pnc owned approximately 35 million common stock equivalent shares of blackrock equity at december 31, 2015, accounted for under the equity method. the primary risk measurement, similar to other equity investments, is economic capital. the business segments review section of this item 7 includes additional information about blackrock.
tax credit investments included in our equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated partnerships which totaled $2.3 billion at december 31, 2015 and $2.6 billion at december 31, 2014. these equity investment balances include unfunded commitments totaling $669 million and $717 million at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively. these unfunded commitments are included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.
note 2 loan sale and servicing activities and variable interest entities in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report has further information on tax credit investments.
private equity the private equity portfolio is an illiquid portfolio comprised of mezzanine and equity investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment.
private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $1.4 billion at december 31, 2015 and $1.6 billion at december 31, 2014. as of december 31, 2015, $1.1 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies and $.3 billion was invested indirectly through various private equity funds. included in direct investments are investment activities of two private equity funds that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. the noncontrolling interests of these funds totaled $170 million as of december 31, 2015. the interests held in indirect private equity funds are not redeemable, but pnc may receive distributions over the life of the partnership from liquidation of the underlying investments. see item 1 business  supervision and regulation and item 1a risk factors of this report for discussion of the potential impacts of the volcker rule provisions of dodd-frank on our interests in and of private funds covered by the volcker rule.
in 2015, pnc invested with six other banks in early warning services (ews), a provider of fraud prevention and risk management solutions. ews then acquired clearxchange, a network through which customers send and receive person-to-person payments. integrating these businesses will enable us to, among other things, create a secure, real-time payments network.
our unfunded commitments related to private equity totaled $126 million at december 31, 2015 compared with $140 million at december 31, 2014.
visa see note 7 fair value, note 20 legal proceedings and note 21 commitments and guarantees in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information regarding the october 2007 visa restructuring, our involvement with judgment and loss sharing agreements with visa and certain other banks, the status of pending interchange litigation, the sales of portions of our visa class b common shares and the related swap agreements with the purchasers.
during 2015, we sold 2.0 million visa class b common shares, in addition to the 16.5 million shares sold in previous years. we have entered into swap agreements with the purchasers of the shares as part of these sales. see note 7 fair value in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information. at december 31, 2015, our investment in visa class b common shares totaled approximately 4.9 million shares and had a carrying value of $31 million. based on the december 31, 2015 closing price of $77.55 for the visa class a common shares, the fair value of our total investment was approximately $622 million at the current conversion rate. the visa class b common shares that we own are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into shares of the publicly traded class of stock, which cannot happen until the settlement of all of the specified litigation.
90 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k other equity investments we also have certain other equity investments, the majority of which represent investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. the economic values could be driven by either the fixed-income market or the equity markets, or both. given the nature of these investments, if market conditions affecting their valuation were to worsen, we could incur future losses. net gains related to these investments were not significant during 2015 and 2014.
our unfunded commitments related to other investments at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 were not significant.
impact of inflation our assets and liabilities are primarily financial in nature and typically have varying maturity dates. accordingly, future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money. however, during periods of inflation, there may be a subsequent impact affecting certain fixed costs or expenses, an erosion of consumer and customer purchasing power, and fluctuations in the need or demand for our products and services. should significant levels of inflation occur, our business could potentially be impacted by, among other things, reducing our tolerance for extending credit or causing us to incur additional credit losses resulting from possible increased default rates.
financial derivatives we use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to market and credit risk inherent in our business activities. substantially all such instruments are used to manage risk related to changes in interest rates. interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, swaptions, options, forwards and futures contracts are the primary instruments we use for interest rate risk management. we also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities.
financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, market and credit risk. periodic cash payments are exchanged for interest rate swaps, options and future contracts. premiums are also exchanged for options contracts. therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments.
further information on our financial derivatives is presented in note 1 accounting policies, note 7 fair value and note 14 financial derivatives in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report, which is incorporated here by reference.
not all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.

(a)   represents the net fair value of assets and liabilities.
consolidated income statement review summary results net income for 2014 of $4.2 billion, or $7.30 per diluted common share, was stable compared with 2013 results of $4.2 billion, or $7.36 per diluted common share. a decrease in revenue of 4% mainly due to lower yields on loans and investment securities was mostly offset by a reduction in provision for credit losses and a 2% decline in noninterest expense.
net interest income net interest income was $8.5 billion in 2014 and decreased by $622 million, or 7%, compared with 2013 reflecting the ongoing low rate environment. lower yields on loans and investment securities, a decline in investment securities balances and a reduction in purchase accounting accretion were partially offset by commercial and commercial real estate loan growth. lower net interest income also included the impact from the second quarter 2014 correction to reclassify certain commercial facility fees from net interest income to noninterest income.
net interest margin was 3.08% in 2014 and 3.57% in 2013. the decrease in the comparison was driven by a 50 basis point decline in the yield on total interest-earning assets, which included the impact of lower purchase accounting accretion, continued spread compression, and repricing of new and existing loans and securities in the ongoing low rate environment. the decline also included the impact of the second quarter 2014 correction to reclassify certain commercial facility fees and the impact of higher interest-earning deposits maintained with the federal reserve bank.
noninterest income noninterest income was $6.9 billion for 2014 and 2013, as strong overall client fee income was offset by lower residential mortgage revenue, declines in asset valuations and reduced sales of securities. noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 45% for 2014, up from 43% for 2013.
asset management revenue increased $171 million, or 13%, in 2014 to $1.5 billion, compared to 2013, driven by increased earnings from our blackrock investment, as well as stronger average equity markets and positive net flows, after adjustments for cyclical client activities. discretionary client assets under management in the asset management group increased to $135 billion at december 31, 2014 compared with $127 billion at december 31, 2013.
consumer service fees were $1.3 billion for 2014 and 2013, as higher consumer service fees in retail banking were offset by lower revenue from previously discontinued insurance programs, as well as the termination of our debit card rewards program in the fourth quarter of 2013, which resulted in a prior year benefit and consequently diluted the year-over-year growth comparison.
corporate service fees increased to $1.4 billion in 2014 compared to $1.2 billion in 2013, driven by higher merger and acquisition advisory fees from a record year for our mergers and acquisition advisory firm, harris williams, and the impact of the second quarter 2014 correction to reclassify certain commercial facility fees from net interest income to noninterest income. these increases were partially offset by lower net commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation gains.
lower residential mortgage revenue in the comparison also reflected the impact of the 2013 net benefit from release of reserves for residential mortgage repurchase obligations, as the impact to 2014 was not significant. this net release of reserves in 2013 was largely the result of agreements with fhlmc and fnma for loans sold into agency securitizations.
service charges on deposits increased to $662 million in 2014 compared to $597 million in 2013, benefitting from changes in product offerings and higher customer-related activity.
other noninterest income decreased to $1.4 billion in 2014 compared to $1.5 billion in 2013. the decline was driven by a reduction in asset valuations, lower revenue associated with private equity investments, decreased revenue due to the lower market value of investments related to deferred compensation obligations, and lower revenue associated with customer-related derivative activities, including credit valuations, which were primarily driven by market interest rate changes impacting the valuations. these decreases were partially offset by higher gains on sales of other assets.
higher gains on sales of other assets in 2014 included the sale of pncs washington, d.c. regional headquarters building, as well as increased gains on sales of visa class b common shares, which were $209 million on sales of 3.5 million shares in 2014 compared to $168 million on the sale of 4 million shares in 2013. as of december 31, 2014, we held approximately 7 million visa class b common shares with a fair value of approximately $742 million and a recorded investment of approximately $77 million.
92 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses totaled $273 million in 2014 compared with $643 million in 2013. the decrease in provision reflected improved overall credit quality, including lower consumer loan delinquencies. a contributing economic factor was the increasing value of residential real estate, which improved expected cash flows from our purchased impaired loans.
noninterest expense noninterest expense was $9.5 billion for 2014, a decrease of $.2 billion, or 2%, compared to 2013, reflecting overall disciplined expense management. the decline was driven by a decrease in personnel expense related to lower headcount and benefits costs, partially offset by investments in technology and infrastructure. additionally, noncash charges in 2013 for unamortized discounts related to redemption of trust preferred securities contributed to the decline. see note 14 capital securities of subsidiary trusts and perpetual trust securities in item 8 of our 2013 form 10-k for additional detail on the 2013 redemption of trust preferred securities.
during 2014, we completed actions and exceeded our 2014 continuous improvement goal of $500 million in cost savings. these cost savings funded investments in our infrastructure, including those related to cybersecurity and our datacenters, and investments in our diversified businesses, including our retail banking transformation, consistent with our strategic priorities.
effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate was 25.1% for 2014 compared with 25.9% for 2013. the effective tax rate is generally lower than the statutory rate primarily due to tax credits pnc receives from our investments in low income housing and new markets investments, as well as earnings in other tax exempt investments.
consolidated balance sheet review loans loans increased $9.2 billion to $204.8 billion as of december 31, 2014 compared with december 31, 2013. the increase in loans was driven by the increase in commercial lending as a result of growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans, primarily from new customers and organic growth. the decline in consumer lending resulted from lower home equity, education and residential mortgage loans, partially offset by growth in automobile loans.
average total loans increased by $9.7 billion to $199.6 billion in 2014, which was driven by increases in average commercial loans of $6.4 billion and average commercial real estate loans of $3.2 billion. the overall increase in loans reflected organic loan growth, primarily in our corporate & institutional banking segment. average total loans were 70% and 73% of average interest-earning assets in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
investment securities as of december 31, 2014, the amortized cost and fair value of available for sale securities totaled $43.2 billion and $44.2 billion, respectively, compared to an amortized cost and fair value as of december 31, 2013 of $48.0 billion and $48.6 billion, respectively. the amortized cost and fair value of held to maturity securities were $11.6 billion and $12.0 billion, respectively, at december 31, 2014, compared to $11.7 billion and $11.8 billion, respectively, at december 31, 2013. investment securities represented 16% of total assets at december 31, 2014 and 19% at december 31, 2013. average investment securities decreased to $55.8 billion during 2014 compared to $57.3 billion during 2013. average investment securities were 20% and 22% of average interest-earning assets in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. the fair value of investment securities generally decreases when interest rates increase and vice versa. in addition, the fair value generally decreases when credit spreads widen and vice versa. net unrealized gains in the total investment securities portfolio increased to $1.5 billion at december 31, 2014 from $.7 billion at december 31, 2013 primarily due to the impact of market interest rates and credit spreads. the comparable amounts for the securities available for sale portfolio were $1.1 billion and $.6 billion, respectively.
during 2014, we transferred securities with a fair value of $1.4 billion from available for sale to held to maturity. we changed our intent and committed to hold these high-quality securities to maturity in order to reduce the impact of price volatility on accumulated other comprehensive income and certain capital measures, after taking into consideration market conditions and regulatory capital requirements under basel iii capital standards.
the weighted-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio (excluding corporate stocks and other) was 4.3 years at december 31, 2014 and 4.9 years at december 31, 2013.
residential mortgage loan origination volume was $9.5 billion in 2014 compared to $15.1 billion in 2013. the majority of such loans were originated under agency or federal housing administration (fha) standards. we sold $8.3 billion of loans and recognized loan sales revenue of $420 million in 2014. the comparable amounts for 2013 were $14.7 billion and $568 million, respectively.
asset quality overall asset quality trends in 2014 improved from 2013. nonperforming assets decreased $.6 billion, or 17%, to $2.9 billion at december 31, 2014 compared to december 31, 2013. nonperforming assets to total assets were 0.83% at december 31, 2014, compared to 1.08% at december 31, 2013. overall loan delinquencies of $1.9 billion at december 31, 2014 decreased $.5 billion, or 22%, compared with december 31, 2013. net charge-offs of $.5 billion in 2014 declined 51% compared to net charge-offs of $1.1 billion for 2013. net charge-offs were 0.27% of average loans in 2014 and 0.57% of average loans in 2013.
the net charge-off comparisons above were impacted by alignment with interagency guidance in the first quarter of 2013 on practices for loans and lines of credit related to consumer lending. in the first quarter 2013, this alignment had the overall effect of (i) accelerating charge-offs, (ii) increasing nonperforming loans and (iii) in the case of loans accounted for under the fair value option, increasing nonaccrual loans.
at december 31, 2014, our largest nonperforming asset was $35 million in the real estate, rental and leasing industry and our average nonperforming loans associated with commercial lending were under $1 million.
funding sources total funding sources increased $22.0 billion to $289.0 billion at december 31, 2014 compared with december 31, 2013.
total deposits increased $11.3 billion to $232.2 billion at december 31, 2014 compared with december 31, 2013 due to strong growth in demand and money market, partially offset by lower retail certificates of deposit. interest-bearing deposits represented 68% of total deposits at both december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013.
average total deposits increased $10.8 billion to $222.9 billion in 2014 compared with the prior year. higher average money market deposits, average noninterest-bearing deposits, and average interest-bearing demand deposits drove the increase in both commercial and consumer average deposits. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.6 billion in average retail certificates of deposit attributable to runoff of maturing accounts. average total deposits represented 68% of average total assets for 2014 and 69% for 2013.
total borrowed funds increased $10.7 billion to $56.8 billion at december 31, 2014 compared with december 31, 2013 as higher federal home loan bank (fhlb) borrowings and issuances of bank notes and senior debt and subordinated debt were partially offset by a decline in federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements.
average borrowed funds were $48.8 billion in 2014 compared with $40.0 billion in 2013. the increase was primarily due to increases in average fhlb borrowings, average bank notes and senior debt, and average subordinated debt, in part to enhance our liquidity position. these increases were partially offset by a decline in average commercial paper.
94 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k shareholders equity total shareholders equity increased $2.2 billion, to $44.6 billion at december 31, 2014 compared with december 31, 2013, primarily reflecting an increase in retained earnings, partially offset by share repurchases of $1.2 billion under pncs existing common stock repurchase authorization. the increase in retained earnings was driven by net income of $4.2 billion, reduced by $1.2 billion of common and preferred dividends declared. accumulated other comprehensive income increased slightly as the impact of market interest rates and credit spreads on securities available for sale and derivatives that are part of cash flow hedging strategies were mostly offset by the impact of pension and other postretirement benefit plan adjustments. common shares outstanding were 523 million at december 31, 2014 and 533 million at december 31, 2013.
risk-based capital as a result of the staggered effective dates of the final u.s. basel iii regulatory capital rules (basel iii rules), as well as the fact that pnc remains in the parallel run qualification phase for the advanced approaches, pncs regulatory risk-based ratios in 2014 were based on the definitions of, and deductions from, capital under basel iii (as such definitions and deductions were phased-in for 2014) and basel i risk weighted assets (subject to certain adjustments as defined by the basel iii rules). we refer to the capital ratios calculated using the phased-in basel iii provisions in effect for 2014 and applicable risk-weighted assets as the 2014 transitional basel iii ratios.
our 2014 transitional basel iii ratios at december 31, 2014 were 10.9% for tier 1 common, 10.8% for leverage, 12.6% for tier 1 risk-based and 15.8% for total risk-based capital.
pncs basel i ratios as of december 31, 2013, which were pncs effective regulatory capital ratios as of that date, were 10.5% for tier 1 common, 11.1% for leverage, 12.4% for tier 1 risk-based and 15.8% for total risk-based capital.
we provide additional information on our 2014 risk-based capital ratios in the capital portion of the balance sheet review section in item 7 of our 2014 form 10-k. for additional information on our 2014 transitional basel iii ratios and 2013 basel i tier 1 ratio, see also the statistical information (unaudited) section in item 8 of this report.
adjusted average total assets  primarily comprised of total average quarterly (or annual) assets plus (less) unrealized losses (gains) on investment securities, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (net of eligible deferred taxes).
annualized  adjusted to reflect a full year of activity.
basel iii common equity tier 1 capital  common stock plus related surplus, net of treasury stock, plus retained earnings, plus accumulated other comprehensive income for securities currently and previously held as available for sale, plus accumulated other comprehensive income for pension and other postretirement benefit plans, less goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities, less other disallowed intangibles, net of deferred tax liabilities and plus/less other adjustments.
basel iii common equity tier 1 capital ratio  common equity tier 1 capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets (as applicable).
basel iii tier 1 capital  common equity tier 1 capital, plus preferred stock, plus certain trust preferred capital securities, plus certain noncontrolling interests that are held by others and plus/less other adjustments.
basel iii tier 1 capital ratio  tier 1 capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets (as applicable).
basel iii total capital  tier 1 capital plus qualifying subordinated debt, plus certain trust preferred securities, plus, under the basel iii transitional rules and the standardized approach, the allowance for loan and lease losses included in tier 2 capital and other.
basel iii total capital ratio  total capital divided by period-end risk-weighted assets (as applicable).
cash recoveries  cash recoveries used in the context of purchased impaired loans represent cash payments for a single purchased impaired loan not included within a pool of loans from customers that exceeded the recorded investment of that loan.
charge-off  process of removing a loan or portion of a loan from our balance sheet because it is considered uncollectible. we also record a charge-off when a loan is transferred from portfolio holdings to held for sale by reducing the loan carrying amount to the fair value of the loan, if fair value is less than carrying amount.
combined loan-to-value ratio (cltv)  this is the aggregate principal balance(s) of the mortgages on a property divided by its appraised value or purchase price.
common shareholders equity to total assets  common shareholders equity divided by total assets. common shareholders equity equals total shareholders equity less the liquidation value of preferred stock.
credit derivatives  contractual agreements, primarily credit default swaps, that provide protection against a credit event of one or more referenced credits. the nature of a credit event is established by the protection buyer and protection seller at the inception of a transaction, and such events include bankruptcy, insolvency and failure to meet payment obligations when due. the buyer of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of a credit event.
credit spread  the difference in yield between debt issues of similar maturity. the excess of yield attributable to credit spread is often used as a measure of relative creditworthiness, with a reduction in the credit spread reflecting an improvement in the borrowers perceived creditworthiness.
credit valuation adjustment (cva)  represents an adjustment to the fair value of our derivatives for our own and counterparties non-performance risk.
derivatives  financial contracts whose value is derived from changes in publicly traded securities, interest rates, currency exchange rates or market indices. derivatives cover a wide assortment of financial contracts, including but not limited to forward contracts, futures, options and swaps.
discretionary client assets under management  assets over which we have sole or shared investment authority for our customers/clients. we do not include these assets on our consolidated balance sheet.
duration of equity  an estimate of the rate sensitivity of our economic value of equity. a negative duration of equity is associated with asset sensitivity (i.e., positioned for rising interest rates), while a positive value implies liability sensitivity (i.e., positioned for declining interest rates). for example, if the duration of equity is -1.5 years, the economic value of equity increases by 1.5% for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.
96 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k earning assets  assets that generate income, which include: federal funds sold; resale agreements; trading securities; interest-earning deposits with banks; loans held for sale; loans; investment securities; and certain other assets.
effective duration  a measurement, expressed in years, that, when multiplied by a change in interest rates, would approximate the percentage change in value of on- and off- balance sheet positions.
enterprise risk management framework  an enterprise process designed to identify potential risks that may affect pnc, manage risk to be within our risk appetite and provide reasonable assurance regarding achievement of our objectives.
fair value  the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
fee income  when referring to the components of noninterest income, we use the term fee income to refer to the following categories within noninterest income: asset management; consumer services; corporate services; residential mortgage; and service charges on deposits.
fico score  a credit bureau-based industry standard score created by fair isaac co. which predicts the likelihood of borrower default. we use fico scores both in underwriting and assessing credit risk in our consumer lending portfolio. lower fico scores indicate likely higher risk of default, while higher fico scores indicate likely lower risk of default. fico scores are updated on a periodic basis.
funds transfer pricing  a management accounting methodology designed to recognize the net interest income effects of sources and uses of funds provided by the assets and liabilities of a business segment. assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing characteristics, tenor and other factors.
futures and forward contracts  contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to deliver a specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. may be settled either in cash or by delivery of the underlying financial instrument.
gaap  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.
impaired loans  loans are determined to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected. impaired loans include commercial nonperforming loans and consumer and commercial tdrs, regardless of nonperforming status. excluded from impaired loans are nonperforming leases, loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option, smaller balance homogenous type loans and purchased impaired loans.
interest rate swap contracts  contracts that are entered into primarily as an asset/liability management strategy to reduce interest rate risk. interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest rate payments, such as fixed-rate payments for floating-rate payments, based on notional principal amounts.
intrinsic value  the difference between the price, if any, required to be paid for stock issued pursuant to an equity compensation arrangement and the fair market value of the underlying stock.
leverage ratio  tier 1 capital divided by average quarterly adjusted total assets.
loan-to-value ratio (ltv)  a calculation of a loans collateral coverage that is used both in underwriting and assessing credit risk in our lending portfolio. ltv is the sum total of loan obligations secured by collateral divided by the market value of that same collateral. market values of the collateral are based on an independent valuation of the collateral. for example, a ltv of less than 90% is better secured and has less credit risk than a ltv of greater than or equal to 90%.
exposure, and other factors. each loan has its own lgd. the lgd risk rating measures the percentage of exposure of a specific credit obligation that we expect to lose if default occurs. lgd is net of recovery, through any means, including but not limited to the liquidation of collateral or deficiency judgments rendered from foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings.
nonaccrual loans  loans for which we do not accrue interest income. nonaccrual loans include nonperforming loans, in addition to loans accounted for under fair value option and loans accounted for as held for sale for which full collection of contractual principal and/or interest is not probable.
nondiscretionary client assets under administration  assets we hold for our customers/clients in a nondiscretionary, custodial capacity. we do not include these assets on our consolidated balance sheet.
nonperforming loans  loans accounted for at amortized cost for which we do not accrue interest income. nonperforming loans include loans to commercial, commercial real estate, equipment lease financing, home equity, residential real estate, credit card and other consumer customers as well as tdrs which have not returned to performing status. nonperforming loans exclude certain government insured or guaranteed loans for which we expect to collect substantially all principal and interest, loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and purchased impaired loans. nonperforming loans exclude purchased impaired loans as we are currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans.
notional amount  a number of currency units, shares, or other units specified in a derivative contract.
operating leverage  the period to period dollar or percentage change in total revenue (gaap basis) less the dollar or percentage change in noninterest expense. a positive variance indicates that revenue growth exceeded expense growth (i.e., positive operating leverage) while a negative variance implies expense growth exceeded revenue growth (i.e., negative operating leverage).
options  contracts that grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right, but not the obligation, to either purchase or sell the associated financial instrument at a set price during a specified period or at a specified date in the future.
other real estate owned (oreo) and foreclosed assets  assets taken in settlement of troubled loans primarily through deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or foreclosure. foreclosed assets include real and personal property, equity interests in corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies. excludes certain assets that have a government-guarantee which are classified as other receivables.
other-than-temporary impairment (otti)  when the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost basis, an assessment is performed to determine whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. if we intend to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss, an other-than-temporary impairment is considered to have occurred. in such cases, an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investments amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. further, if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security, an other-than-temporary impairment is considered to have occurred. however for debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its recovery, the other-than-temporary loss is separated into (a) the amount representing the credit loss, and (b) the amount related to all other factors. the other-than-temporary impairment related to credit losses is recognized in earnings while the amount related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax.
parent company liquidity coverage  liquid assets divided by funding obligations within a two year period.
primary client relationship  an asset management group client relationship with annual revenue generation of $10,000 or more.
probability of default (pd)  an internal risk rating that indicates the likelihood that a credit obligor will enter into default status.
98 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k purchase accounting accretion  accretion of the discounts and premiums on acquired assets and liabilities. the purchase accounting accretion is recognized in net interest income over the weighted-average life of the financial instruments using the constant effective yield method. accretion for a single purchased impaired loan not included within a pool of loans includes any cash recoveries on that loan received in excess of the recorded investment.
purchased impaired loans  acquired loans (or pools of loans) determined to be credit impaired under fasb asc 310-30 (aicpa sop 03-3). loans (or pools of loans) are determined to be impaired if there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected.
recorded investment (purchased impaired loans)  the initial investment of a purchased impaired loan plus interest accretion and less any cash payments and writedowns to date. the recorded investment excludes any valuation allowance which is included in our allowance for loan and lease losses.
recovery  cash proceeds received on a loan that we had previously charged off. we credit the amount received to the allowance for loan and lease losses.
return on average capital  annualized net income divided by average capital.
return on average common shareholders equity  annualized net income attributable to common shareholders divided by average common shareholders equity.
risk  the potential that an event or series of events could occur that would threaten pncs ability to achieve its strategic objectives, thereby negatively affecting shareholder value or reputation.
risk appetite  a dynamic, forward-looking view on the aggregate amount of risk pnc is willing and able to take in executing business strategy in light of the current business environment.
risk limits  quantitative measures based on forward looking assumptions that allocate the firms aggregate risk appetite (e.g. measure of loss or negative events) to business lines, legal entities, specific risk categories, concentrations and as appropriate, other levels.
risk profile  the risk profile is a point-in-time assessment of risk. the profile represents overall risk position in relation to the desired risk appetite. the determination of the risk profiles position is based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of reported risk limits, metrics, operating guidelines and qualitative assessments.
securitization  the process of legally transforming financial assets into securities.
servicing rights  an intangible asset or liability created by an obligation to service assets for others. typical servicing rights include the right to receive a fee for collecting and forwarding payments on loans and related taxes and insurance premiums held in escrow.
taxable-equivalent interest  the interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. as such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. to provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all interest-earning assets, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on other taxable investments. this adjustment is not permitted under gaap on the consolidated income statement.
total equity  total shareholders equity plus noncontrolling interests.
total return swap  a non-traditional swap where one party agrees to pay the other the total return of a defined underlying asset (e.g., a loan), usually in return for receiving a stream of libor-based cash flows. the total returns of the asset, including interest and any default shortfall, are passed through to the counterparty. the counterparty is, therefore, assuming the credit and economic risk of the underlying asset.
transitional basel iii common equity  common equity calculated under basel iii using phased in definitions and deductions applicable to pnc during the applicable presentation period.
watchlist  a list of criticized loans, credit exposure or other assets compiled for internal monitoring purposes. we define criticized exposure for this purpose as exposure with an internal risk rating of other assets especially mentioned, substandard, doubtful or loss.
yield curve  a graph showing the relationship between the yields on financial instruments or market indices of the same credit quality with different maturities. for example, a normal or positive yield curve exists when long-term bonds have higher yields than short-term bonds. a flat yield curve exists when yields are the same for short-term and long-term bonds. a steep yield curve exists when yields on long-term bonds are significantly higher than on short-term bonds. an inverted or negative yield curve exists when short-term bonds have higher yields than long-term bonds.

                                                    our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than we are currently expecting. these statements are based on our current view that the u.s. economy will grow moderately again in 2016, boosted by lower oil/energy prices, improving housing activity and solid job gains, and that short-term interest rates and bond yields will rise very gradually during 2016. these forward-looking statements also do not, unless otherwise indicated, take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory contingencies.
                                                    pncs ability to take certain capital actions, including paying dividends and any plans to increase common stock dividends, repurchase common stock under current or future programs, or issue or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments, is subject to the review of such proposed actions by the federal reserve as part of pncs comprehensive capital plan for the applicable period in connection with the regulators ccar process and to the acceptance of such capital plan and non-objection to such capital actions by the federal reserve.
                                              pncs regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, the companys financial performance, the scope and terms of final capital regulations then in effect (particularly those implementing the basel capital accords), and management actions affecting the composition of pncs balance sheet. in addition, pncs ability to determine, evaluate and
100 the pnc financial services group, inc.  form 10-k forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and regulatory approval of related models.
                                                      legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and ability to attract and retain management. these developments could include:
   changes to regulations governing bank capital and liquidity standards, including due to the dodd-frank act and to basel-related initiatives.
                                                     unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries. in addition to matters relating to pncs current and historical business and activities, such matters may include proceedings, claims, investigations, or inquiries relating to pre-acquisition business and activities of acquired companies, such as national city. these matters may result in monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies, including fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to pnc.
   results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental agencies.
   impact on business and operating results of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual property protection in general.
                                                    business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards. in particular, our results currently depend on our ability to manage elevated levels of impaired assets.
   business and operating results also include impacts relating to our equity interest in blackrock, inc. and rely to a significant extent on information provided to us by blackrock. risks and uncertainties that could affect blackrock are discussed in more detail by blackrock in its sec filings.
                                                       we grow our business in part by acquiring from time to time other financial services companies, financial services assets and related deposits and other liabilities. acquisition risks and uncertainties include those presented by the nature of the business acquired, including in some cases those associated with our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, and the integration of the acquired businesses into pnc after closing.
                                                    competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. industry restructuring in the current environment could also impact our business and financial performance through changes in counterparty creditworthiness and performance and in the competitive and regulatory landscape. our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.

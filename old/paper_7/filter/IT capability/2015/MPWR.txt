item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear under item 8 in this annual report on form 10-k.
overview we are a leading company in high performance power solutions. founded in 1997, we design and provide small, highly energy efficient, easy-to-use power solutions for systems found in industrial applications, telecommunication infrastructures, cloud computing, automotive, and consumer applications. our mission is to reduce total energy consumption in our customers' systems with green, practical, compact solutions. we believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated, smaller in size, more energy efficient, more accurate with respect to performance specifications and, consequently, more cost-effective than many competing solutions. we plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families, as well as in new innovative product categories.
we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain products. we are not and will not be immune from current and future industry downturns, but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance.
we work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits ("ics"). this has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs, while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths.
following the introduction of a product, our sales cycle generally takes a number of quarters after we receive an initial customer order for a new product to ramp up. typical lead time for orders is fewer than 90 days. these factors, combined with the fact that orders in the semiconductor industry can typically be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer, make the forecasting of our orders and revenue difficult.
we derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements and direct sales to customers in asia, where the products we produce are incorporated into end-user products. our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia was 91%, 91% and 90% for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter product family which serves the communications, storage and computing, consumer and industrial markets. we believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new products, enter new market segments, gain market share, manage litigation risk, diversify our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity.
in july 2014, we completed the acquisition of sensima technology sa ("sensima"), a company located in switzerland that develops magnetic sensors for angle measurements as well as three-dimensional magnetic field sensing. sensima became a subsidiary of mps and changed its name to mps tech switzerland sarl. the acquisition creates new opportunities with customers by offering enhanced solutions in power management for key industries such as automotive, industrial and cloud computing. the purchase consideration consisted of an upfront cash payment of $11.7 million and additional consideration that is contingent upon sensima achieving a new product introduction and certain revenue and direct margin goals in 2016, with a fair value of $2.5 million at the date of acquisition. in addition, key employees received $1.7 million of time-based restricted stock units and up to $8.0 million of performance-based restricted stock units in connection with the transaction. these equity awards are considered arrangements for post-acquisition services and the related compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable that the performance goals will be met. the results of operations of sensima have been included in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the acquisition date.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, inventories, income taxes, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, and contingencies. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are, by their nature, uncertain and unpredictable, and depend upon, among other things, many factors outside of our control, such as demand for our products and economic conditions.  accordingly, our estimates and judgments may prove to be incorrect and actual results may differ, perhaps significantly, from these estimates.
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fees charged for products delivered and the collectability of those fees. the application of these criteria has resulted in us generally recognizing revenue upon shipment (when title and risk of loss have transferred to customers), including distributors, original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers.
our revenue consists primarily of sales of assembled and tested finished goods. we also sell die in wafer form to our customers and value-added resellers, and we receive royalty revenue from third parties and value-added resellers.
for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, approximately 96%, 92% and 91% of our distributor sales, respectively, including sales to our value-added resellers, were made through distribution arrangements with third parties. these arrangements generally do not include any special payment terms (our normal payment terms are 30-45 days for our distributors), price protection or exchange rights. returns are limited to our standard product warranty. certain of our large distributors have contracts that include limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the previous six months' purchases.
for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, approximately 4%, 8% and 9% of our distributor sales, respectively, were made through small distributors primarily based on purchase orders. these distributors typically have no stock rotation rights.
(3)   the distributors' obligation is unchanged in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage to the products.
(5)   we do not have any obligations for future performance to directly bring about the resale of our products by the distributors.
(6)   the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated. we have the ability and the information necessary to track inventory sold to and held at our distributors. we maintain a history of returns and have the ability to estimate the stock rotation returns on a quarterly basis.
we maintain a sales reserve for stock rotation rights, which is based on historical experience of actual stock rotation returns on a per distributor basis, where available, and information related to products in the distribution channel. this reserve is recorded at the time of sale. historically, these returns were not material to our consolidated financial statements.
if we enter into arrangements that have rights of return that are not estimable, we recognize revenue under such arrangements only after the distributors have sold the products to end customers. four of our distributors have distribution agreements where revenue is recognized upon sale by these distributors to their end customers because these distributors have certain rights of return which management believes are not estimable. the deferred revenue balance from these distributors as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 was $2.8 million and $2.0 million, respectively. the deferred costs as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 were $0.2 million.
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of the standard cost (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or its current estimated market value.  we write down inventory for obsolescence or lack of demand, based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. conversely, if market conditions are more favorable, inventory may be sold that was previously reserved.
valuation of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets we evaluate intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. we perform an annual impairment assessment for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. impairment of intangible assets is recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the assets and their carrying value. impairment for goodwill occurs if the fair value of a reporting unit including goodwill is less than its carrying value and is recognized based on the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the carrying value of the goodwill. the assumptions and estimates used to determine future value of goodwill and intangible assets are complex and subjective. they can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and revenue forecasts. if there is a significant adverse change in our business in the future, including macroeconomic and market conditions, we may be required to record impairment charges on our goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets.
accounting for income taxes we recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. we also recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.
our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality or uncertainty to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting or tax laws in the u.s. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. in addition, we recognize liabilities for potential u.s. and foreign income tax for uncertain income tax positions taken on our tax returns if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements in the period such determination is made. we have calculated our uncertain tax positions which were attributable to certain estimates and judgments primarily related to transfer pricing, cost sharing and our international tax structure exposure.
as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had a valuation allowance of $18.6 million and $19.1 million, respectively, attributable to management's determination that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets in the u.s. will not be realized. should it be determined that additional amounts of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future, an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made. likewise, in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
as a result of the cost sharing arrangements with our international subsidiaries (cost share arrangements), relatively small changes in costs that are not subject to sharing under the cost share arrangements can significantly impact the overall profitability of the u.s. entity. because of the u.s. entity's inconsistent earnings history and uncertainty of future earnings, we have determined that it is more likely than not that the u.s. deferred tax benefits will not be realized.
contingencies we are a party to actions and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including litigation regarding our shareholders and our intellectual property, challenges to the enforceability or validity of our intellectual property, claims that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, and employment matters. the pending proceedings involve complex questions of fact and law and will require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend. in addition, from time to time, we become aware that we are subject to other contingent liabilities. when this occurs, we will evaluate the appropriate accounting for the potential contingent liabilities to determine whether a contingent liability should be recorded. in making this determination, management may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. based on the facts and circumstances in each matter, we use our judgment to determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss has occurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated. if we determine a loss is probable and estimable, we record a contingent loss. in determining the amount of a contingent loss, we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations, prior case history and other factors. should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. alternatively, if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted, for example, if a particular contingent loss does not occur, the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on our results of operations.
stock-based compensation we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award.  the fair value of restricted stock units with service conditions or performance conditions is based on the grant date share price. the fair value of restricted stock units with market conditions, as well as restricted stock units with both market conditions and performance conditions, is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model.  the fair value of options and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan is estimated using the black-scholes model.
we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant-date fair value for all share-based payment awards that are expected to vest. this expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the entire awards, unless the awards are subject to market conditions or performance conditions, in which case we recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche. for awards with performance conditions, as well as awards with both market conditions and performance conditions, we recognize compensation expense when it becomes probable that the performance criteria set by the board of directors will be achieved. this assessment is performed on a quarterly basis and requires significant assumptions and estimates made by management related to the projected achievement of the performance goals, which can be affected by external factors, such as macroeconomic conditions and the analog industry forecasts, and internal factors, such as our business and operations strategy, product roadmaps and revenue forecasts. changes in the probability assessment of achieving the performance conditions are accounted for in the period of change by recording a cumulative catch-up adjustment as if the new estimate had been applied since the service inception date. if the actual performance targets achieved differ significantly from those projected by management, additional compensation expense may be recorded for the performance-based awards due to the cumulative catch-up adjustment, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. furthermore, the amount of compensation expense that we recognize is based on an expected forfeiture rate. if there is a difference between the forfeiture assumptions used in determining stock-based compensation costs and the actual forfeitures which become known over time, we may change the forfeiture rate, which could have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense.
recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. the standard's core principle is that an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. in july 2015, the fasb approved a one-year deferral of the effective date. the standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. early adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016. the standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. we are evaluating the impact of the adoption on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures.
in november 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-17, balance sheet classification of deferred taxes, which requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, including related valuation allowance, be classified as non-current on the balance sheets. we have elected to early adopt the standard as of december 31, 2015 on a retrospective basis. as of december 31, 2014, we reclassified $0.2 million of current deferred tax assets to non-current deferred tax assets on the consolidated balance sheet. the adoption did not affect our operating results, comprehensive income or cash flows for the periods presented.

revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $333.1 million, an increase of $50.6 million, or 17.9%, from $282.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was due to higher sales of both dc to dc and lighting control products, as unit shipments increased 17% due to higher market demand with current customers and additional design wins with new customers, coupled with an increase of 1% in average sales prices. revenue from our dc to dc products was $299.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, an increase of $46.6 million, or 18.4%, from the same period in 2014. this increase was primarily due to higher sales of our dc to dc converters and battery chargers, which were offset in part by lower sales of our mini-monsters products. revenue from our lighting control products was $33.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, an increase of $3.9 million, or 13.2%, compared with the same period in 2014.
revenue for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $282.5 million, an increase of $44.4 million, or 18.7%, from $238.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was due to higher sales of both dc to dc and lighting control products, as unit shipments increased 37% due to higher market demand with current customers and additional design wins with new customers, which were offset in part by a 13% decrease in average sales prices. revenue from our dc to dc products was $253.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $41.7 million, or 19.8%, from the same period in 2013. this increase was primarily due to higher sales of our dc to dc converters, offset in part by lower sales of our mini-monsters products. revenue from our lighting control products was $29.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $2.7 million, or 10.1%, compared with the same period in 2013.
cost of revenue and gross margin cost of revenue primarily consists of costs incurred to manufacture, assemble and test our products, as well as warranty costs, inventory-related and other overhead costs, and stock-based compensation expenses. in addition, cost of revenue includes amortization of intangible assets from the sensima acquisition beginning in the third quarter of 2014.

gross profit                                        $180,169                $152,618                $127,901           18.1        %       19.3        %
cost of revenue was $152.9 million, or 45.9% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2015, and $129.9 million, or 46.0% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2014. the $23.0 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 17% increase in unit shipments, coupled with a 4% increase in the average direct cost of units shipped. the increase in cost of revenue was also driven by additional amortization of intangible assets of $1.1 million.
gross margin was 54.1% for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared with 54.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014. for the year ended december 31, 2015, gross margin was favorably impacted by lower labor and overhead costs as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by increased sales of lower margin products and higher amortization of intangible assets compared to the same period in 2014.
cost of revenue was $129.9 million, or 46.0% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2014, and $110.2 million, or 46.3% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2013. the $19.7 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 37% increase in unit shipments, which was partially offset by a 14% decrease in the average direct cost of units shipped. the increase in cost of revenue was also driven by an increase of $0.8 million in the provision for inventory reserve and additional amortization of intangible assets of $0.7 million.
gross margin was 54.0% for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to 53.7% for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower labor and overhead costs as a percentage of revenue compared to the same period in 2013. this increase was partially offset by an increase in the provision for inventory reserve and higher amortization of intangible assets.
research and development research and development ("r&d") expenses primarily consist of salary and benefit expenses, bonuses and stock-based compensation expenses for design and product engineers, expenses related to new product development and supplies, and facility costs.
year ended december 31,                                      change
r&d expenses were $65.8 million, or 19.8% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2015 and $58.6 million, or 20.7% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2014. the $7.2 million increase in r&d expenses was primarily due to an increase of $3.7 million in cash compensation expenses, which include salary, benefits and bonuses, an increase of $2.1 million in stock-based compensation expenses primarily associated with the performance-based equity awards, an increase of $0.5 million in new product development expenses, and an increase of $0.3 million in manufacturing and laboratory supplies. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.2 million related to the changes in the value of the employee deferred compensation plan liabilities. our r&d headcount was 506 employees as of december 31, 2015, compared with 476 employees as of december 31, 2014.
r&d expenses were $58.6 million, or 20.7% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2014 and $49.7 million, or 20.9% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2013. the $8.9 million increase in r&d expenses was primarily due to an increase of $2.8 million in stock-based compensation expenses primarily associated with the performance-based and market-based equity awards, an increase of $2.4 million in new product development expenses, an increase of $2.0 million in cash compensation expenses, which include salary, benefits and bonuses, and an increase of $0.6 million in manufacturing and laboratory supplies. our r&d headcount was 476 employees as of december 31, 2014, compared with 449 employees as of december 31, 2013.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses primarily include salary and benefit expenses, bonuses and stock-based compensation expenses for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, sales commissions, travel expenses, facilities costs, and professional service fees.
year ended december 31,                                      change
sg&a expenses were $72.3 million, or 21.7% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2015 and $66.8 million, or 23.6% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2014. the $5.5 million increase in sg&a expenses was primarily due to an increase of $5.7 million in stock-based compensation expenses primarily associated with the performance-based equity awards, an increase of $2.0 million in cash compensation expenses, which include salary, benefits and bonuses, and an increase of $0.6 million in commission expenses due to higher revenue. these increases were partially offset by a credit of $2.5 million related to the release of a contingent consideration liability (see below), a decrease of $0.6 million in professional service fees due to the transaction costs incurred in the sensima acquisition in 2014 but not in 2015, and a gain of $0.3 million from sales of certain operating equipment. our sg&a headcount was 306 employees as of december 31, 2015, compared with 274 employees as of december 31, 2014.
our acquisition of senisma in july 2014 included a contingent consideration arrangement which requires us to pay up to $8.9 million to certain former sensima shareholders if sensima achieves a new product introduction as well as certain product revenue and direct margin targets in 2016. the fair value of the contingent consideration at the acquisition date was $2.5 million, which was estimated based on a probability-weighted analysis of possible future revenue outcomes. as part of the quarterly assessment in the fourth quarter of 2015, management reviewed the sales forecast for the products and concluded that the projected product revenue in 2016 will not likely meet the minimum target required to earn the contingent consideration, primarily because the product adoption process by customers will take longer than we had originally anticipated. accordingly, the fair value of the contingent consideration was deemed to be $0 as of december 31, 2015, and we recorded the release of the liability of $2.5 million as a credit to sg&a expenses. we will continue to assess the probability of former sensima shareholders earning the contingent consideration in 2016 and may record additional adjustment to the fair value.
sg&a expenses were $66.8 million, or 23.6% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2014 and $54.6 million, or 22.9% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2013. the $12.2 million increase in sg&a expenses was primarily due to an increase of $9.7 million in stock-based compensation expenses primarily associated with the performance-based and market-based equity awards, an increase of $0.9 million in professional service fees primarily due to the transaction costs of $0.6 million incurred in the sensima acquisition, an increase of $0.5 million in cash compensation expenses, which include salary, benefits and bonuses, and an increase of $0.3 million in commission expenses due to higher revenue. our sg&a headcount was 274 employees as of december 31, 2014, compared to 249 employees as of december 31, 2013.
litigation expense (benefit), net litigation expense was $1.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared with a litigation benefit, net, of $(8.0) million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the net litigation benefit for the year ended december 31, 2014 included the recognition of a $9.5 million award from the o2 micro litigation, partially offset by $0.5 million of additional legal fees incurred in connection with the final resolution of the litigation.
litigation benefit, net, was $(8.0) million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared with a litigation benefit, net, of $(0.4) million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the net litigation benefit for the year ended december 31, 2014 included the recognition of a $9.5 million award from the o2 micro litigation, partially offset by $0.5 million of additional legal fees incurred in connection with the final resolution of the litigation. the net litigation benefit for the year ended december 31, 2013 included $0.8 million of proceeds received in connection with the legal settlement with silergy corporation. the increase in net litigation benefit for the year ended december 31, 2014 was partially offset by higher expenses we incurred in other litigation matters, compared to the same period in 2013.
for a complete description of our material litigation matters, see note 13 "litigation" of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
interest and other income, net interest and other income, net, was $1.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared with $1.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange gains and higher interest income, partially offset by higher expenses related to the changes in the value of the employee deferred compensation plan assets.
interest and other income, net, was $1.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared with $0.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange gains and higher interest income.
income tax provision the income tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $7.3 million, or 17.2% of pre-tax income. we recorded a one-time net charge of $2.7 million to the income tax provision related to the resolution of the income tax audits in the second quarter of 2015. in addition to the impact of this charge, the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because foreign income was taxed at lower rates, and because of the benefit that we realized from stock option exercises and the release of rsus, and from the release of an income tax reserve where the statute of limitations expired. in addition, the effective tax rate was impacted by changes in the valuation allowance.
the income tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $0.9 million, or 2.5% of pre-tax income. the income tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2013 was $1.1 million, or 4.6% of pre-tax income. the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate in both 2014 and 2013 primarily because our foreign income was taxed at lower rates, and because of the benefit that we realized from stock options exercises and the release of rsus, and changes in our valuation allowance during the year.

(1)   in november 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-17, balance sheet classification of deferred taxes, which requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, including related valuation allowance, be classified as non-current on the balance sheets. we early adopted this standard retrospectively and reclassified $0.2 million of the current deferred tax assets to non-current deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014.
as of december 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $90.9 million and short-term investments of $144.1 million, compared with cash and cash equivalents of $126.3 million and short-term investments of $112.5 million as of december 31, 2014. as of december 31, 2015, $55.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $36.8 million of short-term investments were held by our international subsidiaries. if these funds are needed for our operations in the u.s., we may be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes to repatriate these funds. however, our intent is to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the u.s. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund the u.s. operations.
the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, reduced by accounts payable, accrued compensation and related benefits, and other accrued liabilities. as of december 31, 2015, we had working capital of $288.6 million, compared with working capital of $271.1 million as of december 31, 2014. the $17.5 million increase in working capital was due to a $24.0 million increase in current assets, partially offset by a $6.5 million increase in current liabilities. the increase in current assets was primarily due to an increase in short-term investments, accounts receivable and inventories, partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to an increase in other accrued liabilities.

net cash provided by (used in) financing activities                       (46,652    )              (39,227    )               18,850
effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents               (1,293    )                 (486    )                  897
for the year ended december 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $69.7 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, change in fair value of contingent consideration and a net decrease of $12.6 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. the increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by increased sales. the increase in inventories was primarily due to an increase in strategic wafer and die bank inventories as well as an increase in finished goods to meet future demand. the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $74.1 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net decrease of $8.0 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to increased sales and higher shipments in the fourth quarter of 2014. the increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by increased inventory and capital asset purchases to meet future growth. the decrease in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by the release of a liability related to the o2 micro litigation, partially offset by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, net cash provided by operating activities was $60.7 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net increase of $4.5 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. the increase in accounts receivable resulted primarily from an increase in shipments. the increase in inventories was primarily due to an increase in strategic wafer and die bank inventories as well as an increase in finished goods to meet future demand. the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily due to a cash award received in connection with the o2 micro litigation that was recorded as a liability as of december 31, 2013.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $57.2 million, primarily due to net purchases of investments of $33.5 million, purchases of property and equipment of $16.0 million, and net contributions to the employee deferred compensation plan of $8.0 million.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, we spent $5.4 million to purchase three units of an office building located in shanghai, china. we also exercised the option to purchase a leased manufacturing facility in chengdu, china for approximately $1.7 million, which we expect to close in the first half of 2016. in addition, our board of directors approved a plan to spend up to $17 million to purchase additional office space in china in 2016 to accommodate future growth.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $9.4 million, primarily due to net cash of $11.6 million paid to acquire sensima, purchases of property and equipment of $9.5 million, and net contributions to the employee deferred compensation plan of $5.3 million, partially offset by net proceeds from sales of investments of $12.4 million and proceeds of $4.7 million from the redemption of auction-rate securities. for the year ended december 31, 2013, net cash used in investing activities was $54.3 million, primarily due to net purchases of investments of $40.1 million and purchases of property and equipment of $15.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from the redemption of auction-rate securities of $2.0 million.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, net cash used in financing activities was $46.7 million, primarily reflecting $32.3 million used in repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program and $30.0 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold rsus, partially offset by $10.0 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan. for the year ended december 31, 2014, net cash used in financing activities was $39.2 million, primarily reflecting $41.2 million used in repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program and $11.7 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold rsus, partially offset by $14.0 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan. for the year ended december 31, 2013, net cash provided by financing activities was $18.9 million, primarily reflecting $40.0 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $20.6 million used in repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program.
in july 2013, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to $100 million in the aggregate of our common stock through june 30, 2015. in april 2015, our board of directors approved an extension of the program through december 31, 2015. all shares were retired upon repurchase. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we repurchased a total of 0.6 million shares for $32.3 million, at an average price of $50.05 per share. for the year ended december 31, 2014, we repurchased a total of 1.1 million shares for $41.2 million, at an average price of $39.19 per share. for the year ended december 31, 2013, we repurchased a total of 0.7 million shares for $20.6 million, at an average price of $31.06 per share. in february 2016, our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes us to repurchase up to $50 million in the aggregate of our common stock through december 31, 2016.
in june 2014, our board of directors approved a dividend program pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, beginning in july 2014. in addition, outstanding rsu awards contain rights to receive dividend equivalents, which entitle employees who hold rsus to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. the dividend equivalents are accumulated quarterly during the vesting periods of the rsus and are payable to the employees when the awards vest. dividend equivalents accumulated on the rsus are forfeited if the employees do not fulfill their service requirement during the vesting periods. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling $30.0 million. for the year ended december 31, 2014, we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling $11.7 million.
although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and short-term investments, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. we anticipate the cash used for future dividends, dividend equivalents and the stock repurchase program will come from our current domestic cash and cash generated from ongoing u.s. operations. if cash held by our international subsidiaries is needed for these payments, we may be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes to repatriate these funds.
in the future, in order to strengthen our financial position, respond to unforeseen circumstances, or fund our growth in future financial periods, we may need to raise additional funds by any one or a combination of the following: issuing equity securities, issuing debt or convertible debt securities, incurring indebtedness secured by our assets, or selling certain product lines and/or portions of our business. there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
from time to time, we have engaged in discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of product lines, technologies, businesses and companies, and we continue to consider potential acquisition candidates. any such transactions could involve the issuance of a significant number of new equity securities, assumptions of debt, and/or payment of cash consideration.  we may also be required to raise additional funds to complete any such acquisitions, through either the issuance of equity and debt securities or incurring indebtedness secured by our assets. if we raise additional funds or acquire businesses or technologies through the issuance of equity securities or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution.

(2)   other long-term obligations include long-term liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, which primarily consist of employee deferred compensation plan liabilities and accrued dividend equivalents. because of the uncertainty as to the timing of distributions related to a portion of the employee deferred compensation plan liabilities, we have excluded estimated obligations of $0.7 million from the table above. in addition, because of the uncertainty as to the timing of payments related to our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, we have excluded estimated obligations of $2.9 million from the table above.
off balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2015, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303(a)(4) of the securities and exchange commission's regulation s-k.

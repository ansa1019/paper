certain measures in the section entitled "-key factors affecting our performance-billings," "-comparison of the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014" are presented on a constant currency basis. our constant currency, billings and free cash flow measures included in the sections entitled "-key factors affecting our performance-billings," "-comparison of the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014," and "-key factors affecting our performance-free cash flow" are not in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap. these non-gaap financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. these measures may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. we believe investors should consider these non-gaap financial measures in evaluating our results as they are indicative of our ongoing performance and reflect how management evaluates our operational results and trends.
overview servicenow is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions that define, structure, manage and automate services across the global enterprise. our mission is to help the modern enterprise operate faster and be more scalable by applying a service-oriented lens to the activities, tasks and processes that comprise day-to-day work life. our solutions, and the custom solutions built by our customers and partners, are empowering enterprises to change the way people work. we offer our services on an annual subscription fee basis which includes access to the ordered subscription service and related support including updates to the subscribed service during the subscription term. we provide a scaled pricing model based on the duration of the subscription term and we frequently extend discounts to our customers based on the number of users. we generate sales through our direct sales team and indirectly through channel partners and third-party referrals. we also generate revenues from professional services for implementation and training of customer personnel. we generally bill our customers annually in advance for subscription services and monthly in arrears for our professional services as the work is performed.
a majority of our revenues come from large global enterprise customers. we continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth. we increased our overall employee headcount to 3,686 as of december 31, 2015 from 2,826 as of december 31, 2014.
key factors affecting our performance renewal rate. we calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100%. our attrition rate for a period is equal to the annualized contract value, or acv, from lost customers divided by the total acv from all customers that renewed during the period, excluding changes in price or users, and total acv from all lost customers. a lost customer is a customer that did not renew a contract expiring that, in our judgment, will not be renewed. typically a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer. however, in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customer's acv, we may deem the renewal as a lost customer. our renewal rate was 98%, 97% and 96% for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
upsell rate. to grow our business it is important for us to generate additional sales from existing customers, which we refer to as our upsell rate. we calculate our upsell rate as the acv of upsells, net of losses and reductions in acv from existing customers during the period, divided by our total acv signed during the period. our upsell rate was 38%, 43% and 39% for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we expect our upsell rate to decrease in the long term as our renewal base continues to grow.
our upsells are primarily derived from an increase in the number of user seats purchased by our customers and are also derived from the addition of other subscription services. in the first quarter of 2015, we made a change to our customer count definition to better align to a global standard for business identification and tracking. refer to the "total customers" paragraph below for further details about the change. the change in customer count definition increased the upsell rate we had disclosed in the prior year from 36% to 43% for the year ended december 31, 2014, and from 31% to 39% for the year ended december 31, 2013.
total customers. we believe our total customer count is a key indicator of our market penetration, growth and future revenues. we have aggressively invested in, and intend to continue to invest in, our direct sales force and partnerships with our indirect sales channel in order to grow our customer base. based on our new definition of customer count as described below, our total enterprise customer count was approximately 3,000, 2,300 and 1,800, as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. as of december 31, 2015, we had approximately 400 customers that have purchased our express product offering ("express customers"), which is our entry-level it service management solution. our express customer count as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 was less than 100.
in the first quarter of 2015, we changed our definition of customer count to better align to a global standard for business identification and tracking. previously, we generally defined a customer as an entity with an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. in situations where a single contract applied to entities with multiple subsidiaries or divisions, universities or governmental organizations, each entity that contracted for a separate production instance of our services was counted as a separate customer. beginning on january 1, 2015, a customer is defined as an entity with a unique dunn & bradstreet global ultimate, or gult, data universal numbering system, or duns, and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. the duns number is a global standard for business identification and tracking. we will make exceptions for holding companies, government entities and other organizations for which the gult, in our judgment, does not accurately represent the servicenow customer. for example, while all u.s. government agencies roll up to "government of the united states" under the gult, we count each government agency that we contract with as a separate customer.
the change in customer count definition reduced our enterprise customer count by approximately 14% and 12% as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we did not previously disclose our express customer count. as the enterprise customer definition is a factor used in the calculation of other metrics we disclose (upsell rate, number of customers with acv greater than $1 million, number of deals with net new acv greater than $1 million and average contract term for new customers, upsells and renewals), we have revised previously disclosed numbers for the impacted metrics to ensure comparability across the periods.
number of customers with acv greater than $1 million. we count the total number of customers with acv greater than $1 million as of the end of the period. we had 230, 153 and 81 customers with acv greater than $1 million as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the change in customer count definition increased the total number of customers with acv greater than $1 million we previously disclosed in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2014 from 129 to 153 for the year ended december 31, 2014, and from 67 to 81 for the year ended december 31, 2013.
the number of deals with net new acv greater than $1 million entered into during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, were 36, 34 and 15, respectively. we define net new acv as acv from new customers and upsells to existing customers, net of losses to those customers. the change in customer count definition decreased the total number of deals with acv greater than $1 million we had disclosed in the prior year from 36 to 34 for the year ended december 31, 2014, and increased the total number of deals with acv greater than $1 million from 14 to 15 for the year ended december 31, 2013.
g2k customer count. the global 2000, or g2k, customer count is defined as the total number of g2k companies in our customer base as of the end of the period. the forbes global 2000 is an annual ranking of the top 2000 public companies in the world by forbes magazine. the ranking is based on a mix of four metrics: sales, profit, assets, and market value. the forbes global 2000 is updated annually in the second quarter of the calendar year. current and prior period g2k customer counts are based on the most recent list for comparability purposes. we adjust the g2k count for acquisitions, spin-offs, and other market activity to ensure the g2k customer count is accurately captured. for example, we add a g2k customer when a g2k company that is not our customer acquires a company in our existing customer base that is not a g2k company. when we enter into a contract with a g2k parent company, or any of its related subsidiaries, or any combination of entities within a g2k company, we count only one g2k customer. we do not count further penetration into entities within the g2k as a new customer in the g2k customer count. our g2k customer count based on the most recent forbes global 2000 and adjusted for acquisitions, spin-offs and other market activity was 638, 538 and 445 as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
average acv per g2k customer. we calculate average acv for our g2k customers by taking cumulative acv from g2k customers as of the end of the period divided by the cumulative count of g2k customers as of the end of the period. our average acv per g2k customer was approximately $868,000, $711,000 and $515,000 for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
billings. we define billings as revenue recognized plus the change in total deferred revenue as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows. the change in total deferred revenue as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows represent the change in deferred revenues in local currencies translated into u.s. dollars using an average foreign currency exchange rate, and is a better approximation of actual billings as it is more aligned with the exchange rates in effect at the time of the billings. we believe billings offers investors useful supplemental information regarding the performance of our business and will help investors better understand the sales volume and performance of our business.
year ended december 31,          % change           year ended december 31,          % change
change in deferred revenue from the consolidated statements of cash flows         195,900                   168,393               16      %                  94,405                   78      %
our international operations provide a significant portion of our total billings and revenues. as a result, the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily the euro) from the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2015 had an unfavorable impact on our billings and revenues. for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31, 2015 at the exchange rates for the year ended december 31, 2014 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our total billings would have increased by an additional $74.3 million, with $60.1 million of the increase relating to an increase in total revenues and $14.2 million of the increase relating to the change in deferred revenue from the consolidated statements of cash flows.
average contract term. we calculate the average contract term for new customers, upsells and renewals based on the term of those contracts entered into during the period weighted by their acv. the average new customer contract term was 31 months, 32 months and 34 months for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the average upsell contract term was 26 months, 25 months and 24 months for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the average renewal contract term was 24 months for the year ended december 31, 2015, and 26 months for each of the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013.
in the first quarter of 2015, we made a change to our customer count definition to better align to a global standard for business identification and tracking. refer to the "total customers" paragraph section above for further details of the change. the change in customer count definition decreased the average new customer contract term from 34 months as disclosed in the prior year to 32 months for the year ended december 31, 2014, and increased the average new customer contract term from 33 months as previously disclosed to 34 months for the year ended december 31, 2013. the change in customer count increased the average upsell contract term from 24 months as disclosed in the prior year to 25 months for the year ended december 31, 2014. the change in customer count definition had no impact to our disclosures in the annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2014 for the average upsell for the year ended december 31, 2013 and the average renewal contract term for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013.
free cash flow. we define free cash flow, a non-gaap financial measure, as gaap net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment. we believe information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to invest in our business and fund ongoing operations. however, our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. a calculation of free cash flow is provided below:
net cash provided by operating activities      $315,091                $138,900               $81,746
components of results of operations revenues subscription revenues. subscription revenues are comprised primarily of fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and upgrades, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term. pricing includes multiple instances, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future upgrades, when and if available, offered during the subscription term. we typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal. our contracts are generally non-cancelable during the subscription term, though a customer can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform.
professional services and other revenues. professional services revenues consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription service. our arrangements for professional services are primarily on a time-and-materials basis. we generally invoice our professional services monthly in arrears based on actual hours and expenses incurred. other revenues primarily include fees from customer training delivered on-site or publicly available classes, attendance and sponsorship fees for our annual knowledge user conference and other customer forums. typical payment terms require our customers to pay us within 30 days of invoice.
we generate sales directly through our sales team and, to a lesser extent, through our channel partners. revenues from our direct sales organization represented 89%, 87% and 88% for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we make sales to our channel partners at a discount and record those revenues at the discounted price when all revenue recognition criteria are met. from time to time, our channel partners also provide us referrals for which we pay a referral fee. we pay referral fees to channel partners and other third parties, which is between 5% and 15% of the customer's acv, depending on the level of activity the partner performs in the sales process. we include these fees in sales and marketing expense.
refer to "critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates" below for further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policy.
allocation of overhead costs overhead costs associated with office facilities, corporate expenses, it and certain depreciation related to infrastructure that is not dedicated for customer or research and development use are allocated to cost of revenues and operating expenses based on headcount.
cost of revenues cost of subscription revenues. cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our services and providing support to our customers. these expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs, which includes facility costs associated with our data center, depreciation related to our cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment dedicated for customer use, amortization of acquired developed technology intangibles, personnel related costs directly associated with our cloud-based infrastructure and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead.
cost of professional services and other revenues. cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, the costs of contracted third-party partners and allocated overhead.
professional services associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription services are performed directly by our services team, as well as by contracted third-party partners. fees paid to third-party partners are primarily recognized as cost of revenues as the professional services are delivered. cost of revenues associated with our professional services engagements subcontracted to third-party partners as a percentage of professional services and other revenues was 20% for the year ended december 31, 2015, and 17% for each of the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013.
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses directly associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, commissions and stock-based compensation. sales and marketing expenses also include third-party referral fees, marketing and promotional events, including our annual knowledge user conference, online marketing, product marketing and allocated overhead.
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses directly associated with our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. research and development expenses also include data center capacity costs and depreciation of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment that are used solely for research and development purposes.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, facility and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, external legal, accounting and other professional services fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead.
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. due to cumulative losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against our u.s. deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2015 and 2014. we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to earnings history, projected future outcomes, industry and market trends and the nature of each of the deferred tax assets in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our u.s. deferred tax assets.

our enterprise service management solutions include service management, business management and servicenow platform, which have similar features and functions and are generally priced on a per user basis. our it operations management solutions, which improve visibility, availability and agility of enterprise services, are generally priced on a per node basis. we expect subscription revenues for our it operations management solutions to grow in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in the year ended december 31, 2016.
professional services and other revenues increased $41.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in the services provided to our growing customer base. in addition, revenues from our annual knowledge user conference increased to $10.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $8.2 million in the prior year due to increased sponsorship and paid registrations in the current year. we expect professional services and other revenues to grow at a slower rate compared to subscription revenues as we are increasingly focused on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource and relying on our partner ecosystem to contract directly with customers for service delivery.
our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues. revenues outside north america represented 30% and 32% of total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. as a result, the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily euro) from the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2015 had an unfavorable impact on our revenues. for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31, 2015 at the exchange rates for the year ended december 31, 2014 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our subscription revenues would have increased by an additional $48.0 million and our professional services and other revenues would have increased by an additional $12.0 million.

cost of subscription revenues increased $40.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $11.2 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $8.4 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $6.0 million in depreciation expense primarily due to purchases of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment for our data centers and an increase of $6.0 million in other overhead expenses. data center capacity costs increased $1.0 million primarily due to the expansion of our data centers. amortization of intangible assets increased $4.8 million as a result of the acquisition of neebula systems, ltd., or neebula, in july 2014.
our subscription gross profit percentage increased to 78% for the year ended december 31, 2015, from 75% for the year ended december 31, 2014, due to data center density and improved economies of scale. we expect our cost of subscription revenues to increase in absolute dollar terms as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase the number of users within our customer instances, but we expect such increase to be at a slower rate than the increase in our subscription revenue, leading to a slight increase in our subscription gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31, 2016 as we continue to leverage the investments we have made in our existing data center infrastructure. to the extent future acquisitions are consummated, our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional non-cash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired. our forecast for revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses was based on foreign exchange rates as of december 31, 2015.
cost of professional services and other revenues increased $39.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $11.2 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $10.1 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $5.3 million in overhead expenses, and an increase of $13.2 million in contracted third-party party costs.
our professional services and other gross profit percentage decreased to 7% during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 8% in the prior year due to increased stock-based compensation. the decrease in gross profit percentage was partially offset by the increase in revenues from our annual knowledge user conference. costs associated with knowledge are included in sales and marketing expense. knowledge contributed $10.9 million, or 7 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31, 2015. knowledge contributed $8.2 million, or 7 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31, 2014.
the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2015 had an impact on our cost of revenues. for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31, 2015 at the exchange rates for the year ended december 31, 2014 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the year ended december 31, 2015, our cost of subscription revenues would have increased by an additional $8.0 million and our cost of professional services and other revenues would have increased by an additional $7.8 million.

sales and marketing            $498,439                  $341,119               46      %
sales and marketing expenses increased $157.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount that resulted in an increase of $57.7 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $48.3 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $19.0 million in overhead expenses, and an increase of $15.3 million in commission expense. commissions and referral fee expenses amounted to 8% and 10% of subscription revenues for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
in addition, expenses related to our annual knowledge user conference increased $5.7 million, from $15.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 to $21.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, due to a 31% increase in attendance year-over-year. all other marketing program expenses, which include events, advertising and market data, increased $10.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year.
the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2015 had an impact on our sales and marketing expenses. for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31, 2015 at the exchange rates for the year ended december 31, 2014 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our sales and marketing expenses would have increased by an additional $20.9 million.
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase for the year ended december 31, 2016 in absolute dollar terms, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to expand our direct sales force, increase our marketing activities, grow our international operations, build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events.

research and development expenses increased $69.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount which resulted in an increase of $27.8 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $25.4 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, and an increase of $10.6 million in overhead expenses. research and development expenses also increased $3.5 million due to an increase in data center capacity costs and depreciation of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment that are used solely for research and development purposes.
the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2015 had an impact on our research and development expenses. for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31, 2015 at the exchange rates for the year ended december 31, 2014 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the year ended december 31, 2015, our research and development expenses would have increased by an additional $4.2 million.
we expect research and development expenses to increase for the year ended december 31, 2016 in absolute dollar terms, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services, develop new applications to fill market needs and continue to enhance our core platform.
general and administrative year ended december 31          % change
general and administrative expenses increased $30.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase of $14.2 million in outside services primarily driven by an increase in legal fees associated with our litigation and an increase in the number of contractors to support our administrative functions. in addition, stock-based compensation increased $8.7 million, and personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation increased $7.4 million, primarily driven by the increased headcount.
the impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended december 31, 2014 to the year ended december 31, 2015 is not material to general and administrative expenses.
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase for the year ended december 31, 2016 in absolute dollar terms as we continue to hire people and incur costs associated with our litigations, but remain flat as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to grow. this includes anticipated attorney's fees and expenses for our outstanding litigations with bmc and hpe, but not any forecast related to their outcomes. the trials are currently scheduled for march 2016 and may 2017, respectively. refer to "legal proceedings" in item 3 of this filing for details on the litigation matters.

research and development               70,326                    42,535               65      %
stock-based compensation increased $103.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, primarily due to additional annual grants of equity incentive awards, increased headcount, an increase in the weighted-average grant date fair value of stock awards, and performance rsus granted to our executives in the current year. the new equity incentive awards granted in the current year, including the performance rsus, resulted in an increase of $102.1 million in stock-based compensation. the weighted-average grant date exercise price per stock option share was $75.76 and $61.40 for the year ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the weighted-average grant date fair value per restricted stock unit was $73.98 and $61.13 for the year ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
stock-based compensation is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price and the uncertainty around the achievement of performance criteria associated with our performance rsus. we expect stock-based compensation to continue to increase for the year ended december 31, 2016 in absolute dollar terms, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to grow.
interest expense year ended december 31                           % change
interest expense increased $2.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, due to the increase in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes, or the "notes" issued in november 2013. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we expect to incur approximately $33.3 million in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to the notes.
interest income and other income (expense), net year ended december 31          % change
foreign currency exchange gain (loss)                    51                   2,490              (98     )%
interest income and other expense, net, decreased $0.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a lower foreign currency gain, partially offset by increased interest income. our foreign currency exchange gain decreased $2.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other major currencies and an increase in our foreign operations. interest income increased $1.8 million due to the higher investment balances during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the prior year.
our expanding international operations will continue to increase our exposure to currency risks, though we cannot presently predict the impact of this exposure on our consolidated financial statements. while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date, we are conducting an ongoing evaluation of the costs and benefits of initiating such a program and in the future may hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar.

our effective tax rate was (3)% for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to (2)% for the prior year. our tax expense increased $1.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a higher proportion of taxable earnings in foreign jurisdictions. see note 15 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes.
we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our u.s. federal and state deferred tax assets, and the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes in various jurisdictions. the cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction's individual tax rates, laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions, and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. given the full valuation allowance, sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring, we expect our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. we consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states.
net loss year ended december 31                            % change
net loss increased $19.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the prior year as the growth in our expenses, particularly stock-based compensation, exceeded our revenue growth. we expect to continue to incur a gaap loss for the year ended december 31, 2016, due to increased costs and expenses, including increased non-cash charges associated with equity awards and amortization of intangibles and other expenses.

our professional services and other gross profit percentage decreased to 8% during the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 10% in the prior year due to increased stock-based compensation. the decrease in gross profit percentage was partially offset by the increase in revenues from our annual knowledge user conference. costs associated with knowledge are included in sales and marketing expense. knowledge contributed $8.2 million, or 7 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31, 2014. knowledge contributed $5.0 million in revenue, or 6 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31, 2013.

stock-based compensation increased $88.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount, an increase in the weighted-average grant date fair value of stock awards, and performance rsus granted to our executives in the current year. the new equity incentive awards granted in the current year, including the performance rsus, resulted in an increase of $75.1 million in stock-based compensation. the weighted-average grant date exercise price per stock option share was $61.40 and $38.07 for the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the weighted-average grant date fair value per restricted stock unit was $61.13 and $38.15 for the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

seasonality, cyclicality and quarterly trends we have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our services. we sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the quarter ended december 31. the increase in customer agreements for the quarter ended december 31 is primarily a result of the terms of our commission plans to incentivize our direct sales force to meet their quotas by december 31 and large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry. furthermore, we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of each quarter. this seasonality in our billings, is reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent, in our revenues, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues over the term of the license agreement, which is generally 12 to 36 months. although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance.
our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new customers, as well as upsells to existing customers. we have historically seen an increase in professional services and other revenues in the quarter ended june 30, and a corresponding decrease in professional services and other revenues in the quarter ended september 30 due to the revenues earned from our annual knowledge user conference that occurs in the quarter ended june 30. our operating expenses have increased over the periods presented primarily due to increases in headcount and other related expenses to support our growth. we have historically seen an increase in marketing expenses in the quarter ended june 30, and a corresponding decrease in marketing expenses in the quarter ended september 30 due to the expenses incurred for our annual knowledge user conference. marketing expenses in the quarter ended december 31 are also historically higher due to customer forums we conduct in that quarter. we anticipate operating expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the long-term growth of our business.

our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations. as of december 31, 2015, we had $801.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which $92.3 million represented cash owned by foreign subsidiaries. in addition, we had $422.7 million in long-term investments which provide additional capital resources.
in november 2013, we issued notes with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million and concurrently entered into a hedge, or note hedge, and warrant transaction, or warrants. the net proceeds of this debt issuance are being used for general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. the warrants are exercisable at a strike price of $107.46 per share. upon conversion of the notes, we may choose to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. as of december 31, 2015, the notes were not convertible.
we anticipate our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including the expansion of data centers, lease obligations, expenditures related to the growth of our headcount and the acquisition of fixed assets and investments in office facilities to accommodate our growth for at least the next 12 months. whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth, operating results, cash utilized for acquisitions, if any are consummated, and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our services. if we require additional capital resources to grow our business at any time in the future, we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek additional equity or debt financing.
operating activities cash provided by operating activities mainly consists of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, amortization of issuance cost and debt discount, stock-based compensation, tax benefits from employee stock plans and changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year.
net cash provided by operating activities was $315.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to $138.9 million for the prior year. the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to an increased net loss offset by a substantial increase in non-cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities. net cash flow from the aggregate of changes in accounts receivable, deferred commissions and deferred revenue increased due to increased sales for the year ended december 31, 2015. net cash flows from the aggregate of changes in accrued liabilities, accounts payable and prepaid expenses increased due to the growth of our business and increased headcount of 30% for the year ended december 31, 2015, as well as timing of our cash payments.
net cash provided by operating activities was $138.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $81.7 million for the prior year. the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to an increased net loss offset by a substantial increase in non-cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities. net cash flow from the aggregate of changes in accounts receivable, deferred commissions and deferred revenue increased due to increased sales for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was partially offset by a decrease in net cash flows from the aggregate of changes in accrued liabilities, accounts payable and prepaid expenses due to the growth of our business and increased headcount of 54% for the year ended december 31, 2014.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $231.7 million compared to $316.9 million for the prior year. the decrease in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to the $32.0 million decrease in the net purchases of investments and the $98.7 million decrease in cash used for acquisitions, offset by the $33.1 million increase in capital expenditures related to the purchase of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth, and the $10.5 million increase in the purchases of strategic investments.
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $316.9 million compared to $402.8 million for the prior year. the decrease in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to a decrease in the net purchases of investments of $171.3 million. the decrease was offset by an increase of $86.5 million in acquisition activity due to the neebula acquisition in 2014.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $83.0 million compared to $70.8 million for the prior year. the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the $24.0 million increase in proceeds from employee stock plans, offset by the $12.1 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards.
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $70.8 million compared to $568.6 million for the prior year. the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to net proceeds of $511.7 million from issuance of the notes and warrants and purchase of the note hedge in 2013. the decrease was offset by $13.2 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan, or espp and related tax benefit.
contractual obligations and commitments contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding.
data centers                                $39,375           $17,249                      $13,226                $5,138             $3,762
in addition to the obligations in the table above, approximately $2.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of december 31, 2015. it is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties of $0.2 million and interest of $0.3 million related to these unrecognized tax benefits.
off-balance sheet arrangements during all periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. as such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships.
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. these items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material.
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we derive our revenues from two sources: (i) subscriptions and (ii) professional services and other. subscription revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and updates, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term.
our contracts typically do not give the customer the right to take possession of the software supporting the services. professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our services. professional services and other revenues also include customer training and attendance and sponsorship fees for knowledge, our annual user conference.
we commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met:
•the service has been provided to the customer;
•the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.
we use a signed contract together with a signed order form or a purchase order, as evidence of an arrangement for a new customer. in subsequent transactions with an existing customer, including an upsell or a renewal, we consider the existing signed contract and either the new signed order form or new purchase order as evidence of an arrangement.
we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, the date we make our services available to our customers. once our services are available to customers, we record amounts due in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue. we price professional services primarily on a time-and-materials basis and recognize professional services revenues as the services are delivered using a proportional performance model. such services are delivered over a short period of time. in instances where final acceptance of the services are required before revenues are recognized, we defer professional services revenues and the associated costs until all acceptance criteria have been met.
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors such as past collection history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer. if we determine collectibility is not reasonably assured, we defer revenue recognition until collectibility becomes reasonably assured. we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. our arrangements are generally non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions.
we have multiple element arrangements comprised of subscription fees and professional services. we account for subscription and professional services revenues as separate units of accounting. to qualify as a separate unit of accounting, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis. we have concluded that our subscription service has standalone value as it is routinely sold separately by us. in addition, the applications offered through this subscription service are fully functional without any additional development, modification or customization. we provide customers access to our subscription service at the beginning of the contract term. in determining whether professional services have standalone value, we considered the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer's satisfaction with the professional services work. our professional services, including implementation and configuration services, are not so unique and complex that other vendors cannot provide them. in some instances, customers independently contract with third-party vendors to do the implementation and we regularly outsource implementation services to contracted third-party vendors. as a result, we concluded professional services, including implementation and configuration services, have standalone value.
the total arrangement consideration for a multiple element arrangement is allocated to the identifiable separate units of accounting based on a relative selling price hierarchy. we determined the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence, or vsoe, of selling price or third-party evidence, or tpe, of selling price if vsoe does not exist. if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable, the selling price is determined using the best estimate of selling price, or besp. we determine the besp for each deliverable primarily by considering the historical selling price of these deliverables in similar transactions as well as other factors, including, but not limited to, market competition, review of stand-alone sales and current pricing practices. in determining the appropriate pricing structure, we consider the available information regarding the competitive pricing of similar products and marketing analysis.
in limited circumstances, we grant certain customers the right to deploy our subscription service on the customers' own servers without significant penalty. these arrangements are subject to software revenue recognition guidance since the customer deploys our software. we have analyzed all of the elements in these particular multiple element arrangements and determined that we do not have sufficient vsoe of fair value to allocate revenue to our subscription service and professional services. consequently, we defer all revenue and related costs under the arrangement until the last element in the transaction has been delivered or started to be delivered. once the subscription service and the professional services have commenced, we recognize the entire fee and related costs from the arrangement ratably over the remaining period of the arrangement.
deferred revenue consists primarily of payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our subscriptions and professional services and other revenues and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met.
deferred commissions deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are directly associated with our customer contracts and consist of sales commissions paid to our direct sales force and referral fees paid to independent third-parties. the majority of commissions and referral fees are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related customer contracts. we include amortization of deferred commissions in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the revenue is recognized. the commission payments are paid in full the month after the customer's service commences.
goodwill, intangible assets and other long lived assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. we evaluate and test the recoverability of goodwill for impairment at least annually, during our fourth quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. we perform the impairment testing by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a two-step impairment test. the first step requires the identification of the reporting units and comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the second step of the impairment test is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. under the second step, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. we have determined that we have a single reporting unit. since the aggregate fair value of our company has consistently and materially exceeded the carrying value of our single reporting unit, we did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives ranging from 18 months to 10 years. each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of purchased intangible assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. we periodically review the carrying amounts of these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. we measure the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows we expect the asset to generate. if we consider any of these assets to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating fundamentals, competition and general economic conditions, requires significant judgment. additionally, changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly. therefore, there can be no assurance that a charge to operating expenses will not occur as a result of future goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets impairment tests.
stock-based compensation we recognize compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units, or rsus, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term of four years. for rsus granted with a performance condition, the expenses are recognized on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period, after assessing the probability of achieving requisite performance criteria. this has the impact of greater stock-based compensation expense during the initial years of the vesting period as stock-based compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were, in substance, multiple awards. we recognize compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the espp, on a straight-line basis over the offering period. we estimate the fair value of options using the black-scholes options pricing model and fair value of rsu awards using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. we recognize compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture activity, which is based on historical forfeiture rates. we evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually, or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed. this may cause a fluctuation in our stock-based compensation in the period of change.
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed. we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date. a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. in determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, carry-forward periods, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. we measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision. significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law or guidance, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.
we calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified. the amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by u.s. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. the estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management's assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. to the extent the assessment of such tax position changes, we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination.
recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board, or fasb, issued an update to asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers, or asc 606, that will supersede virtually all existing revenue guidance. under this update, an entity is required to recognize revenue upon transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. as such, an entity will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the current guidance. this update should be applied retrospectively either to each prior reporting period presented in the financial statements, or only to the most current reporting period presented in the financial statements with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded in the retained earnings. this update is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning january 1, 2018. early adoption is permitted for us on january 1, 2017. we are currently evaluating the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements.
in april 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-03, simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. to simplify presentation of debt issuance costs, this new guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. this guidance will become effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years. we elected to early adopt this accounting guidance as of december 31, 2015 on a retrospective basis. as a result of the adoption, we reclassified unamortized debt issuance costs of $0.2 million and $0.3 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, from "other assets" and reflected them as a reduction in "convertible senior notes, net "on the consolidated balance sheets. adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss or consolidated statements of cash flows.
in april 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-05, intangibles-goodwill and other-internal-use software (subtopic 350-40): customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. asu 2015-05 provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes software. if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. if a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. the new guidance does not change the customer's accounting for service contracts. this guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning january 1, 2016. we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
in september 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-16, simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments (topic 805), which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments. asu 2015-16 requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. the new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. this asu is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures as we do not have any business combinations within the measurement period.
in november 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-17, balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. to simplify presentation, the new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. as a result, each jurisdiction will now only have one net non-current deferred tax asset or liability. this guidance will become effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. early adoption is permitted. we elected to early adopt this accounting guidance during the three months ended december 31, 2015 on a prospective basis, resulting in the reclassification of current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, which decreased $15.5 million of "other current assets" and $15.2 million of "other long-term liabilities", and increased $0.3 million of "other assets". prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted.

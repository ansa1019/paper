ansys develops and globally markets engineering simulation software and services widely used by engineers, designers, researchers and students across a broad spectrum of industries and academia, including aerospace and defense, automotive, industrial equipment, electronics, biomedical, energy, materials and chemical processing, and semiconductors. headquartered south of pittsburgh, pennsylvania, the company employed approximately 2,800 people as of december 31, 2015. ansys focuses on the development of open and flexible solutions that enable users to analyze designs directly on the desktop, providing a common platform for fast, efficient and cost-conscious product development, from design concept to final-stage testing and validation. the company distributes its ansys suite of simulation technologies through a global network of independent channel partners and direct sales offices in strategic, global locations. it is the company's intention to continue to maintain this hybrid sales and distribution model.
the company licenses its technology to businesses, educational institutions and governmental agencies. growth in the company's revenue is affected by the strength of global economies, general business conditions, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer budgetary constraints and the competitive position of the company's products. please see the sub-sections entitled "global economic conditions", "decline in customers' businesses", "risks associated with international activities", "rapidly changing technology; new products; risk of product errors" and "competition" under item 1a. risk factors for a complete discussion of how these factors might impact the company's financial condition and operating results. the company believes that the features, functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of its software products are as strong as they have ever been. however, the software business is generally characterized by long sales cycles. these long sales cycles increase the difficulty of predicting sales for any particular quarter. the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short- and long-term sales forecasts that are impacted not only by these long sales cycles, but also by current global economic conditions. as a result, the company believes that its overall performance is best measured by fiscal year results rather than by quarterly results. please see the sub-section entitled "sales forecasts" under item 1a. risk factors for a complete discussion of the potential impact of the company's sales forecasts on the company's financial condition, cash flows and operating results.
the company's management considers the competition and price pressure that it faces in the short- and long-term by focusing on expanding the breadth, depth, ease of use and quality of the technologies, features, functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of its software products as compared to its competitors; investing in research and development to develop new and innovative products and increase the capabilities of its existing products; supplying new products and services; focusing on customer needs, training, consulting and support; and enhancing its distribution channels. from time to time, the company also considers acquisitions to supplement its global engineering talent, product offerings and distribution channels.
in north america, the company experienced strong performance in the electronics, high-tech, aerospace and defense, and automotive industries as companies continued to rely on ansys technology to meet the needs of energy and fuel efficiency, safety and comfort, and the cost-effective delivery of more innovative products in the face of evolving competition and customer requirements. the impact of low oil prices continued to negatively impact north american energy and energy-related customers as they held back on investments, reduced their workforce and considered consolidation and realignment. sales hiring, sales pipeline building and customer engagement activities in north america remained strong as demand for innovation continued to drive simulation investments across a broad array of industries.
europe continued to show progress, but with mixed results and pockets of lingering economic and geopolitical issues. germany continued to lead the region, which also experienced growth and steady progress in countries such as italy and the netherlands. however, the company's performance in europe continued to be adversely impacted as a result of weakness in markets such as france and russia. the company experienced comparable industry trends to those in north america, particularly within the automotive industry. sales hiring and sales pipeline building activities continued to be major areas of focus.
the results in the general international area, which primarily consists of the asia-pacific region, continued to demonstrate progress in japan and india. the growth was adversely impacted by performance in brazil. additionally, business momentum in the chinese state-owned enterprises was slower throughout 2015. throughout the region, the company experienced strength in the aerospace and defense, and high-tech industries. in the industrial equipment industry, continued focus on power generation had a positive impact. the company continued to focus on improving direct sales execution and the new business production of the channel partner network.

the company's revenue increased 0.7% during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the growth rate was adversely impacted by 7.0% due to a strengthening u.s. dollar and would have been 7.8% at currency exchange rates that were in effect for 2014. the growth rate was favorably impacted by the company's continued investment in its global sales, support and marketing organizations. annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 5.2%. this growth was primarily due to maintenance contracts sold with electronics products. perpetual license revenue, which is derived primarily from new sales, decreased 3.1% as compared to the prior year. while lease licenses, perpetual licenses and service revenue declined as compared to the prior year, all were higher in constant currency.
with respect to revenue, on average for the year ended december 31, 2015, the u.s. dollar was 12.5% stronger, when measured against the company's primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended december 31, 2014. the net overall strengthening resulted in decreased revenue of $65.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the impact on revenue was primarily driven by $42.7 million, $14.6 million, $2.9 million and $2.9 million of adverse impact due to a weakening euro, japanese yen, south korean won and british pound, respectively. the net overall strengthening of the u.s. dollar also resulted in decreased operating income of $38.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014.
a substantial portion of the company's license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts. these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal. in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts, a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts. as a result of the significant recurring revenue base, the company's license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period. to the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts is high, incremental lease contracts, and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses, will result in license and maintenance revenue growth in constant currency. conversely, if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors, the company's license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized.
the company is starting to experience an increased interest by its customers in enterprise license agreements that often include longer-term, time-based licenses involving a larger number of the company's software products. while these arrangements typically involve a higher overall transaction price, the revenue from these contracts is typically deferred and recognized over the period of the contract, resulting in increased deferred revenue and backlog. to the extent these types of contracts replace sales of perpetual licenses, there could be a near-term adverse impact on software license and maintenance revenue growth.
international and domestic revenues, as a percentage of total revenue, were 62.4% and 37.6%, respectively, during the year ended december 31, 2015, and 65.8% and 34.2%, respectively, during the year ended december 31, 2014. the company derived 24.2% and 24.9% of its total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
in valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of the company's recent acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates, the company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, resulting in a reduction of deferred revenue as compared to its historical carrying amount. as a result, the company's post-acquisition revenue will be
less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by ansys and each acquiree absent the acquisitions. the impact on reported revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $1.7 million.
cost of sales and gross profit:
the table below reflects the company's operating results as presented on the consolidated statements of income, which are inclusive of foreign currency translation impacts. amounts included in the discussion that follows are provided in constant currency. the impact, where material, of foreign exchange translation on each expense line is provided separately.

software licenses: the net decrease in costs of software licenses was primarily due to the following:
•   cost reduction from foreign exchange translation of $0.9 million.
•   increased spaceclaim-related costs of software licenses of $0.6 million, primarily as a result of twelve months of spaceclaim activity in the current year as compared to eight months of activity in the prior year.
•   increased facilities and it-related maintenance of $0.4 million.
amortization: the net increase in amortization expense was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of trade names, partially offset by a cost reduction related to foreign exchange translation.
maintenance and service: the net decrease in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following:
•   cost reduction related to foreign exchange translation of $7.6 million.
•   increased salaries and severance costs, each of $0.7 million.
•   increased third-party technical support costs of $0.6 million.
the improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue and decrease in related cost of sales.

selling, general and administrative: the net increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily due to the following:
•   increased salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount-related costs of $18.4 million, primarily due to an increase in headcount.
•   increased business travel and meals of $1.6 million.
•   increased consulting costs of $1.4 million.
•   increased office lease and utility costs of $1.0 million.
•   cost reduction due to foreign exchange translation of $13.2 million.
•   decreased severance costs of $3.1 million.
the company anticipates that it will continue to make targeted investments in its global sales and marketing organizations and its global business infrastructure to enhance and support its revenue-generating activities.
research and development: the net increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following:
•   increased salaries and other headcount-related costs of $7.5 million.
•   increased spaceclaim-related research and development costs of $1.8 million, primarily as a result of twelve months of spaceclaim activity in the current year as compared to eight months of activity in the prior year.
•   increased office lease and utility costs of $0.6 million.
•   increased facilities and it-related maintenance of $0.6 million.
•   cost reduction due to foreign exchange translation of $5.4 million.
the company has traditionally invested significant resources in research and development activities and intends to continue to make investments in expanding the ease of use and capabilities of its broad portfolio of simulation software products. more specifically, this includes the evolution of its ansys workbench platform, expansion of high-performance computing capabilities, ansys aim immersive user interface, offerings on ansys enterprise cloud, robust design and ongoing integration of acquired technology.
amortization: the decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a net decrease in the amortization of acquired customer lists and a cost reduction related to foreign exchange translation.
foreign currency gains (losses), net        $486               $(1,649     )
income tax provision: the company recorded income tax expense of $104.2 million and had income before income taxes of $356.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, representing an effective tax rate of 29.2%. during the year ended december 31, 2014, the company recorded income tax expense of $93.4 million and had income before income taxes of $348.1 million, representing an effective tax rate of 26.8%.
the increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to a decrease in benefits related to legal entity restructuring activities. when compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate, the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 were favorably impacted by the domestic manufacturing deduction, research and development credits and tax benefits associated with the merger of the company's japan subsidiaries in 2010. the quarterly benefit of approximately $3.1 million associated with the merger of the company's japan subsidiaries was fully amortized in the third quarter of 2015. there will be no additional ongoing benefit from this transaction. the rates were also favorably impacted by the recurring item of lower statutory tax rates in many of the company's foreign jurisdictions.
net income: the company's net income for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $252.5 million as compared to net income of $254.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. diluted earnings per share was $2.76 for the year ended december 31, 2015 and $2.70 for the year ended december 31, 2014. the weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 91.5 million and 94.2 million for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

•   increased third-party technical support of $1.1 million.
the improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in related cost of sales.
the table below reflects the company's operating results as presented on the consolidated statements of income, which are inclusive of foreign currency translation impacts. amounts included in the discussion that follows are provided in constant currency. the impact, where material, of foreign exchange translation on each expense line is provided separately.

selling, general and administrative: the increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily due to the following:
•   increased salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount-related costs of $11.0 million, primarily due to an increase in headcount.
•   increased selling, general and administrative costs of $4.6 million due to the acquisition of spaceclaim for the period from the acquisition date (april 30, 2014) through december 31, 2014.
•   increased severance costs of $3.3 million.
•   increased selling, general and administrative costs of $2.4 million due to the acquisition of reaction design for the period from the acquisition date (january 3, 2014) through december 31, 2014.
research and development: the increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following:
•   increased salaries and other headcount-related costs of $6.1 million.
•   increased research and development costs of $2.3 million due to the acquisition of spaceclaim for the period from the acquisition date (april 30, 2014) through december 31, 2014.
•   increased research and development costs of $2.3 million due to the acquisition of reaction design for the period from the acquisition date (january 3, 2014) through december 31, 2014.
amortization: the net increase in amortization expense was primarily due to a net increase in the amortization of customer lists, partially offset by a net decrease in the amortization of contract backlog.

income tax provision: the company recorded income tax expense of $93.4 million and had income before income taxes of $348.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, representing an effective tax rate of 26.8%. during the year ended december 31, 2013, the company recorded income tax expense of $77.2 million and had income before income taxes of $322.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 23.9%.
in december 2013, the company received notice from the irs that the joint committee on taxation took no exception to the company's tax returns that were filed for 2009 and 2010. an $11.0 million tax benefit was recognized in the company's 2013 financial results as the company had effectively settled uncertainty regarding the realization of refund claims filed in connection with the 2009 and 2010 returns.
in the u.s., which is the largest jurisdiction where the company receives such a tax credit, the availability of the research and development credit expired at the end of the 2011 tax year. in january 2013, the u.s. congress passed legislation that reinstated the research and development credit retroactive to 2012. the income tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2013 includes approximately $2.3 million related to the reinstated research and development credit for 2012 activity. the research and development credit also expired at the end of the 2013 tax year, but the u.s. congress reinstated the credit in december 2014 for the 2014 tax year.
the increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to the release of an uncertain tax position and the reinstatement of the u.s. research and development credit mentioned above impacting the prior year rate.
net income: the company's net income for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $254.7 million as compared to net income of $245.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. diluted earnings per share was $2.70 for the year ended december 31, 2014 and $2.58 for the year ended december 31, 2013. the weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 94.2 million and 95.1 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
non-gaap results the company provides non-gaap revenue, non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating profit margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to gaap regarding the company's operational performance. these financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with gaap. a detailed explanation and a reconciliation of each non-gaap financial measure to its most comparable gaap financial measure are described below.

note: the 2013 gaap and non-gaap net income and earnings per share data reflected above include $11.0 million of incremental tax benefits, or $0.12 per diluted share, related to the notification received from the irs that the joint committee on taxation took no exception to the company's tax returns that were filed for 2009 and 2010, thus effectively settling the uncertainty regarding refund claims filed in connection with those returns.
non-gaap measures management uses non-gaap financial measures (a) to evaluate the company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and spending budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, (e) to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and (f) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and its employees. in addition, many financial analysts that follow the company focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non-gaap financial measures. the company believes that it is in the best interest of its investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non-gaap financial information. moreover, investors have historically requested and the company has historically reported these non-gaap financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
while management believes that these non-gaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-gaap financial measures. these non-gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap, are not reported by all of the company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. the company compensates for these limitations by using these non-gaap financial measures as supplements to gaap financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-gaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measures.
the adjustments to these non-gaap financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
acquisition accounting for deferred revenue and its related tax impact. historically, the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support its strategic and other business objectives. in accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value. although this acquisition accounting requirement has no impact on the company's business or cash flow, it adversely impacts the company's reported gaap revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition. in order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results, the company provides non-gaap financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment. the company believes that this non-gaap financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare past and future reports of financial results of the company as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related annual lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods.
amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions and its related tax impact. the company incurs amortization of intangible assets, included in its gaap presentation of amortization expense, related to various acquisitions it has made. management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating profit margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. accordingly, management does not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating the performance of the company during the applicable time period after the acquisition, and it excludes such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources. the company believes that these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare past reports of financial results of the company as the company has historically reported these non-gaap financial measures.
stock-based compensation expense and its related tax impact. the company incurs expense related to stock-based compensation included in its gaap presentation of cost of software licenses; cost of maintenance and service; research and development expense; and selling, general and administrative expense. although stock-based compensation is an expense of the company and viewed as a form of compensation, management excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating profit margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company. specifically, the company excludes stock-based compensation during its annual budgeting process and its quarterly and annual assessments of the company's and management's performance. the annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby the company allocates resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. additionally, the annual review by the board of directors during which it compares the company's historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stock-based compensation. in evaluating the performance of senior management and department managers, charges related to stock-based compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results. in fact, the company records stock-based compensation expense into a stand-alone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable. in this way, management is able to review, on a period-to-period basis, each manager's performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stock-based compensation. the company believes that these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the company's operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the company's operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in the company's financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.
transaction costs related to business combinations. the company incurs expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, which are included in its gaap presentation of selling, general and administrative expense. these expenses are generally not tax-deductible. management excludes these acquisition-related transaction expenses for the purpose of calculating non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating profit margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company, as it generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of its continuing operations. the company believes that these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the company's operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the company's operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in the company's financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.
non-gaap financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, gaap. the company's non-gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap financial measures, and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap.
the company has provided a reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures as listed below:

cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market mutual funds and deposits held at major banks. short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held by certain foreign subsidiaries of the company with original maturities of three months to one year. the following table presents the company's foreign and domestic holdings of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments:
foreign                                  245,583                  31.3           232,450                  29.5
if the foreign balances were repatriated to the u.s., they would be subject to domestic tax, resulting in a tax obligation in the period of repatriation. in general, it is the practice and intention of the company to repatriate previously taxed earnings and to reinvest all other earnings of its non-u.s. subsidiaries. the amount of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period, the offset to which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the company's consolidated balance sheet.
cash flows from operating activities year ended december 31,   change
net cash provided by operating activities          $367,523                $385,307                $332,983        $(17,784      )             $52,324
net cash provided by operating activities decreased during the current fiscal year due to decreased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of $18.2 million, primarily due to a $26.8 million refund received in 2014 related to the company's 2009 and 2010 federal income tax years.
net cash provided by operating activities increased during the prior fiscal year due to increased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of $38.1 million, including the aforementioned $26.8 million tax refund, and increased net income (net of non-cash operating adjustments) of $14.2 million.
cash flows from investing activities year ended december 31,                                                                                change

net cash used in investing activities decreased during the current fiscal year due primarily to decreased acquisition-related net cash outlays of $56.9 million and decreased capital expenditures of $9.9 million. the company currently plans capital spending of $20 million to $25 million during fiscal year 2016 as compared to the $16.1 million that was spent in 2015. the level of spending will be dependent upon various factors, including growth of the business and general economic conditions.
net cash used in investing activities increased during the prior fiscal year due primarily to increased acquisition-related net cash outlays of $98.8 million related to the acquisitions of spaceclaim and reaction design, partially offset by decreased capital spending of $2.8 million.
cash flows from financing activities:
year ended december 31,                                            change

net cash used in financing activities increased during the current fiscal year due primarily to increased stock repurchases of $104.1 million.
net cash used in financing activities increased during the prior fiscal year due primarily to increased stock repurchases of $117.7 million, partially offset by decreased principal payments on long-term debt of $53.1 million. the company paid the outstanding balance of its term loan at maturity on july 31, 2013.
other cash flow information during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015, the company completed various acquisitions to accelerate the development of new and innovative products to the marketplace while lowering design and engineering costs for customers. the acquisitions were not individually significant. the combined purchase price of the acquisitions was approximately $49.7 million, which included cash and equity. the operating results of each acquisition have been included in the company's consolidated financial statements since each respective date of acquisition.
the company believes that existing cash and cash equivalent balances of $784.2 million, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet the company's working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the next twelve months. the company's cash requirements in the future may also be financed through additional equity or debt financings. there can be no assurance that such financings can be obtained on favorable terms, if at all.

in february 2016, the company's board of directors increased the number of shares authorized for repurchase to a total of 5.0 million shares under the stock repurchase program. as of december 31, 2015, 2.1 million shares remained available for repurchase under the program.
the company continues to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and believes that the best uses of its excess cash are to invest in the business and repurchase stock in order to both offset dilution and return capital, in excess of its requirements, to stockholders with the goal of increasing stockholder value. additionally, the company has in the past, and expects in the future, to acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, services and technologies. any future acquisitions may be funded by available cash and investments, cash generated from operations, credit facilities, or the issuance of additional securities.
off-balance-sheet arrangements the company does not have any special-purpose entities or off-balance-sheet financing.

(1)   on september 14, 2012, the company entered into a lease agreement for 186,000 square feet of rentable space located in an office facility in canonsburg, pennsylvania, which serves as the company's headquarters. the lease was effective as of september 14, 2012, but because the leased premises were under construction, the company was not obligated to pay rent until three months following the date that the leased premises were delivered to ansys, which occurred on october 1, 2014. the term of the lease is 183 months, beginning on october 1, 2014. the company has a one-time right to terminate the lease effective upon the last day of the tenth full year following the date of possession (december 31, 2024), by providing the landlord with at least 18 months' prior written notice of such termination.
(2)   other operating leases primarily include noncancellable lease commitments for the company's other domestic and international offices as well as certain operating equipment.
(3)   unconditional purchase obligations primarily include software licenses and long-term purchase contracts for network, communication and office maintenance services, which are unrecorded as of december 31, 2015.
(4)   the company has $17.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including estimated interest and penalties, that have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with income tax accounting guidance for which the company is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. as a result, such amounts are excluded from the table above.
(5)   other long-term obligations primarily include deferred compensation of $13.1 million (including estimated imputed interest of $290,000 within 1 year and $250,000 within 2-3 years) and pension obligations of $6.2 million for certain foreign locations of the company.
critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition:  revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts. revenue from perpetual licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized upon delivery of the licensed product and the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys, provided that acceptance has occurred and a signed contractual obligation has been received, the price is fixed and determinable, and collectibility of the receivable is probable. the company determines the fair value of post-contract customer support ("pcs") sold together with perpetual licenses based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately. revenue from pcs contracts is classified as maintenance and service revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
revenue for software lease licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized over the period of the lease contract. typically, the company's software leases include pcs which, due to the short term (principally one year or less) of the company's software lease licenses, cannot be separated from lease revenue for accounting purposes. as a result, both the lease licenses and pcs are recognized ratably over the lease period. due to the short-term nature of the software lease licenses and the frequency with which the company provides major product upgrades (typically every 12-18 months), the company does not believe that a significant portion of the fee paid under the arrangement is attributable to the pcs component of the arrangement and, as a result, includes the revenue for the entire arrangement within software license revenue in the consolidated statements of income.
many of the company's semiconductor products are typically licensed via longer term leases of 24-36 months. the company recognizes revenue for these licenses over the term of the lease contract. because the company does not have vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair value of these leases, the company also recognizes revenue from perpetual licenses over the term of the lease contract during the infrequent occurrence of these licenses being sold with semiconductor leases in multiple-element arrangements.
revenue from training, support and other services is recognized as the services are performed. the company applies the specific performance method to contracts in which the service consists of a single act, such as providing a training class to a customer, and the proportional performance method to other service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple acts (for example, both training and consulting). in applying the proportional performance method, the company typically utilizes output-based estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials, and estimates output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract. input-based estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials, utilizing direct labor as the input measure.
the company also executes arrangements through independent channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute the company's software products to end users of the company's products and services in specified territories. in sales facilitated by channel partners, the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the end-user customer. the company recognizes revenue from transactions with channel partners when the channel partner submits a written purchase commitment, collectibility from the channel partner is probable, a license agreement signed by the end-user customer is received and delivery has occurred, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to the company by the channel partners. this amount includes a fee for pcs that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the end user, which is based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately, and is recognized over the period that pcs is to be provided. the company does not offer right of return, product rotation or price protection to any of its channel partners.
non-income related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable and accrued expenses. the collection and payment of these amounts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and do not impact reported revenues or expenses.
the company warrants to its customers that its software will substantially perform as specified in the company's most current user manuals. the company has not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support, which the company is already obligated to provide. consequently, the company has not established reserves for warranty obligations.
the company's agreements with its customers generally require it to indemnify the customer against claims that the company's software infringes third-party patent, copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights. such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industry-standard respects, including the company's right to replace an infringing product. as of december 31, 2015, the company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding. the company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations, and, consequently, the company has not established any related reserves.
allowance for doubtful accounts:  the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices from both value and delinquency perspectives. for those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable and the geographic area of origin. in determining these percentages, the company considers its historical collection experience and current economic trends in the customer's industry and geographic region. if the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected.
income taxes: the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date.
the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. in making such determination, the company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. in the event the company determines that it will be able to realize deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was used to reduce their carrying value, the adjustment to the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes.
tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more-likely-than-not threshold. otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. the company recognizes interest and penalties related to income taxes within the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of income. accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets: the company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually by performing a quantitative assessment of whether the fair value of each reporting unit or asset exceeds its carrying amount. goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested at the individual asset level. this requires the company to assess and make judgments regarding a variety of factors which impact the fair value of the reporting unit or asset being tested, including business plans, anticipated future cash flows, economic projections and other market data. because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors, significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially impact the company's future financial results. during the first quarter of 2015, the company completed the annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and determined that these assets had not been impaired as of the test date, january 1, 2015. the company tested a previously unamortized trade name that was determined to have a finite life for impairment during the first quarter of 2015 and determined that its fair value exceeded its carrying value, so no impairment was recorded. no other events or circumstances changed during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015 that would indicate that the fair values of the company's reporting unit and indefinite lived intangible asset are below their carrying values.
contingencies: the company is involved in various investigations, claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including commercial disputes, labor and employment matters, tax audits, alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters. the company reviews the status of these matters, assesses its financial exposure and records a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation, claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. as a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates, the company may have to revise its estimates as facts and circumstances change. the revision of these estimates could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations.
stock-based compensation: the company grants options and other stock awards to employees and directors under the company's stock option and grant plan. eligible employees can also purchase shares of the company's common stock at a discount under the company's employee stock purchase plan. the benefits provided under these plans are share-based payments subject to the provisions of share-based payment accounting guidance. the company uses the fair value method to apply the provisions of share-based payment accounting guidance. stock-based compensation expense for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $34.0 million, $36.9 million and $35.3 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2015, total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to unvested stock options and awards granted prior to that date was $52.9 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years.
the value of each stock option award was estimated on the date of grant, or date of acquisition for options issued in a business combination, using the black-scholes option pricing model ("black-scholes model"). the determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards using an option pricing model is affected by the company's stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. these variables include the company's expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. the table below presents the weighted average input assumptions used and resulting fair values for options granted or issued in business combinations during each respective year. the stock-based compensation expense for options is recorded ratably over the requisite service period. the interest rate assumptions were determined by using the five-year u.s. treasury note yield on the date of grant or date of acquisition.

the company issues various restricted stock awards which contain a market condition, a performance condition, a service condition, or any combination of the three. restricted stock awards are valued based on the grant-date fair value of the award. stock compensation expense is recognized over the employee's requisite service period for awards with only a service condition. for awards with a performance condition, stock-based compensation expense is recorded from the service inception date through the conclusion of the measurement period based on management's estimates concerning the probability of vesting.
vesting of restricted stock awards with a market condition is based on the company's performance as measured by total shareholder return relative to the median percentage appreciation of a specified stock index over the measurement period, subject to each participant's continued employment with the company through the conclusion of the measurement period. the fair value of the restricted stock awards with a market condition is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model. the determination of the fair value of the awards is affected by the grant date and a number of variables, each of which has been identified in the chart below for awards granted during each respective period. share-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award is being recorded from the grant date through the conclusion of the measurement period.

the company also grants deferred stock units to non-affiliate independent directors, which are rights to receive shares of common stock upon termination of service as a director. the deferred stock units are issued in arrears and vest immediately.
to the extent the company changes the terms of its stock-based compensation programs, experiences market volatility in the pricing of its common stock that increases the implied volatility assumption used in the black-scholes model, refines different
assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from current estimates, or assumes stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than the company's stock award arrangements, among other potential impacts, the stock-based compensation expense recorded in future periods and the related tax benefits may differ significantly from what was recorded in previous reporting periods.
estimates of stock-based compensation expense are significant to the company's financial statements, but this expense is based on the aforementioned option valuation models and will never result in the payment of cash by the company. for this reason, and because the company does not view stock-based compensation as related to its operational performance, the board of directors and management exclude stock-based compensation expense when evaluating the company's underlying business performance.

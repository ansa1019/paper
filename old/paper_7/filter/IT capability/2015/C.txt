management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary citi's full year 2015 results of operations reflected a solid overall performance. as described in more detail throughout this executive summary, citi's full year 2015 net income of $17.1 billion was its highest since pre-financial crisis, when citi was a very different company in terms of footprint, mix of businesses and assets. during the year, citi was able to grow revenues by 3% and make investments in its core citicorp businesses while reducing its overall expenses, thus improving its overall efficiency ratio. loan and deposit growth in citicorp each grew by 5% while citi's overall balance sheet decreased by 3% (each excluding the impact of foreign currency translation into u.s. dollars for reporting purposes (fx translation)). citi also ended 2015 with a common equity tier 1 capital ratio, on a fully implemented basis, of 12.1%.
in addition to these accomplishments, citi made significant progress on its execution priorities during 2015, including:
•   efficient resource allocation and disciplined expense management: as described above, citi maintained disciplined expense management during 2015, even as it continued to absorb increased regulatory and compliance costs in citicorp and made ongoing business investments. citi's expense management during 2015 was further aided by lower legal and related expenses and lower repositioning expenses in citicorp as compared to the prior year, as discussed further below.
•   continued wind down of citi holdings, while maintaining profitability: citi significantly reduced the assets in citi holdings during the year. citi holdings' assets decreased $55 billion, or 43%, from 2014, ending the year at $74 billion. in addition, as of december 31, 2015, citi had executed agreements to further reduce citi holdings gaap assets by approximately $7 billion in 2016 (for additional information, see "citi holdings" below). as discussed further below, citi holdings also maintained profitability in 2015.
•   utilization of deferred tax assets (dtas): citi utilized approximately $1.5 billion in dtas during 2015 (for additional information, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates-income taxes" below and note 9 to the consolidated financial statements).
citi was able to achieve these results and make ongoing progress on its execution priorities during a year with market volatility and uncertainties, including macroeconomic uncertainties, slower global growth and market volatility resulting from, among other things, lower commodity prices as well as uncertainty regarding the timing and pace of u.s. interest rate changes.
as the year-to-date has shown, citi expects the operating environment in 2016 to remain challenging, with many of the uncertainties impacting its results of operations during 2015
continuing into 2016. for a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could impact citi's businesses, results of operations and financial condition during 2016, see each respective business' results of operations, "risk factors" and "managing global risk" below. while citi may not be able to control all aspects of its operating environment in 2016, it intends to continue to build on the progress made during 2015 by remaining focused on its execution priorities and target client strategy.
2015 summary results citigroup citigroup reported net income of $17.2 billion or $5.40 per share, compared to $7.3 billion or $2.20 per share in the prior year. results in 2015 included $254 million ($162 million after-tax) of cva/dva, compared to negative $390 million (negative $240 million after-tax) in 2014. citigroup full year 2014 results also included a charge of $3.8 billion ($3.7 billion after-tax) to settle rmbs and cdo-related claims recorded in citi holdings and a tax charge of $210 million related to corporate tax reforms recorded in corporate/other.
excluding the impact of cva/dva in both periods as well as the impact of the mortgage settlement and the tax item in 2014, citigroup reported net income of $17.1 billion in 2015, or $5.35 per share, compared to $11.5 billion, or $3.55 per share, in the prior year. (citi's results of operations excluding the impact of cva/dva as well as the impact of the mortgage settlement and the tax item in 2014 are non-gaap financial measures. citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding these impacts provides a more meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.) the 49% increase from the prior year was primarily driven by lower expenses and lower net credit losses, partially offset by lower revenues and a reduced net loan loss reserve release.
citi's revenues were $76.4 billion in 2015, a decrease of 1% from the prior year. excluding cva/dva, revenues were $76.1 billion, down 2% from the prior year, as citicorp revenues decreased by 2% and citi holdings revenues decreased 1%. excluding cva/dva and the impact of fx translation, citigroup revenues increased 3% from the prior year, driven by an increase of 3% in both citicorp and citi holdings' revenues. (citi's results of operations excluding the impact of fx translation are non-gaap financial measures. citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding the impact of fx translation provides a more meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.)
expenses citigroup expenses decreased 21% versus the prior year to $43.6 billion. excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement in the prior year, citigroup expenses declined 15% driven by significantly lower legal and related expenses ($1.5 billion compared to $5.8 billion in the prior year) and
repositioning costs ($472 million compared to $1.6 billion in the prior year), as well as the impact of fx translation (which lowered expenses by approximately $2.6 billion in 2015 compared to the prior year). excluding the impact of both the mortgage settlement in the prior year and fx translation, citigroup's expenses declined 10%, mainly driven by the lower legal and related expenses and repositioning costs.
excluding the impact of fx translation, which lowered reported expenses by approximately $2.4 billion in 2015 compared to the prior year, citicorp expenses decreased 9% also driven by significantly lower legal and related expenses and repositioning costs. citicorp expenses in 2015 included legal and related expenses of $1.1 billion, compared to $4.8 billion in the prior year, and $278 million of repositioning costs, compared to $1.5 billion in the prior year.
citi holdings' expenses were $4.6 billion, down 52% from the prior year. excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement in the prior year, citi holdings' expenses decreased 22%, primarily driven by the ongoing decline in citi holdings assets as well as lower legal and related expenses.
credit costs citi's total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims of $7.9 billion increased 6% from the prior year. excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement in the prior year, citi's total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims increased 7% as a lower net loan loss reserve release was partially offset by lower net credit losses.
net credit losses of $7.3 billion declined 19% versus the prior year. consumer net credit losses declined 19% to $7.1 billion, mostly reflecting continued improvements in north america citi-branded cards and citi retail services in citicorp as well as the north america mortgage portfolio within citi holdings. corporate net credit losses declined 19% to $234 million. as previously disclosed, corporate net credit losses in 2014 included approximately $165 million of net credit losses related to the pemex supplier program in mexico (for additional information, see "institutional clients group" below). excluding these net credit losses in the prior year, net credit losses increased by approximately $111 million, primarily related to a limited number of energy and energy-related corporate loans, predominantly incurred during the latter part of 2015 (for additional information, see "institutional clients group" and "credit risk-corporate credit" below).
the net release of allowance for loan losses and unfunded lending commitments was $120 million in 2015, compared to a $2.4 billion release in 2014, excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement in the prior year. citicorp's net reserve build was $409 million, compared to a net loan loss reserve release of $1.4 billion in 2014. the build in 2015 was primarily driven by net loan loss reserve builds in institutional clients group (icg) during the latter part of 2015, including approximately $530 million for energy and energy-related exposures. overall, citi expects its credit costs in citicorp will likely be higher in 2016 as compared to 2015 given that it believes the vast majority of its net loan loss reserve releases have occurred as credit quality has largely stabilized.
citi holdings' net reserve release, excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement in the prior year, decreased $443 million from the prior year to $529 million, primarily reflecting lower net releases related to the north america mortgage portfolio.
for additional information on citi's consumer and corporate credit costs and allowance for loan losses, see "credit risk" below.
capital citi continued to grow its regulatory capital during 2015, even as it returned approximately $5.9 billion of capital to its shareholders in the form of common stock repurchases and dividends. citigroup's tier 1 capital and common equity tier 1 capital ratios, on a fully implemented basis, were 13.5% and 12.1% as of december 31, 2015, respectively, compared to 11.5% and 10.6% as of december 31, 2014 (all based on the basel iii advanced approaches for determining risk-weighted assets). citigroup's supplementary leverage ratio as of december 31, 2015, on a fully implemented basis, was 7.1%, compared to 5.9% as of december 31, 2014. for additional information on citi's capital ratios and related components, including the impact of citi's dtas on its capital ratios, see "capital resources" below.
citicorp citicorp net income increased 50% from the prior year to $16.2 billion. cva/dva, recorded in icg, was $269 million ($172 million after-tax) in 2015, compared to negative $343 million (negative $211 million after-tax) in the prior year (for a summary of cva/dva by business within icg, see "institutional clients group" below). excluding cva/dva in both periods and the tax item in 2014, citicorp's net income was $16.0 billion, up 43% from the prior year, primarily driven by the lower expenses and net credit losses, partially offset by lower revenues and the net loan loss reserve builds.
citicorp revenues decreased 1% from the prior year to $68.5 billion. excluding cva/dva, citicorp revenues were $68.2 billion in 2015, down 2% from the prior year, reflecting largely unchanged revenues in icg and a 6% decrease in global consumer banking (gcb) revenues. as referenced above, excluding cva/dva and the impact of fx translation, citicorp's revenues grew 3%.
gcb revenues of $33.9 billion decreased 6% versus the prior year. excluding the impact of fx translation, gcb revenues decreased 1%, as decreases in north america gcb and asia gcb were partially offset by an increase in latin america gcb. north america gcb revenues decreased 1% to $19.4 billion, as lower revenues in citi-branded cards were partially offset by higher retail banking revenues. citi-branded cards revenues of $7.8 billion were down 6% versus the prior year, reflecting the continued impact of lower average loans as well as an increase in acquisition and rewards costs related to new account acquisitions, particularly during the second half of 2015. citi retail services revenues of $6.4 billion were largely unchanged versus the prior year, as the continued impact of lower fuel prices and higher contractual partner payments was offset by modest growth in average loans. retail banking revenues increased 6% from the prior
year to $5.2 billion, reflecting continued loan and deposit growth and improved deposit spreads. north america gcb average deposits of $172 billion increased 1% year-over-year and average retail loans of $50 billion grew 7%. average card loans of $107 billion decreased 2%, while purchase sales of $263 billion increased 4% versus the prior year. for additional information on the results of operations of north america gcb for 2015, see "global consumer banking- north america gcb" below.
international gcb revenues (consisting of emea gcb, latin america gcb and asia gcb) decreased 12% versus the prior year to $14.4 billion. excluding the impact of fx translation, international gcb revenues were unchanged versus the prior year. latin america gcb revenues increased 3% versus the prior year, as increases in loan and deposit balances as well as the impact of business divestitures were partially offset by the continued impact of spread compression in cards. asia gcb revenues declined 3% versus the prior year, reflecting lower investment sales revenues as well as continued high payment rates and the ongoing impact of regulatory changes in cards, partially offset by growth in lending, deposit and insurance products. for additional information on the results of operations of latin america gcb and asia gcb (which includes the results of operations of emea gcb for reporting purposes) for 2015, including the impact of fx translation, see "global consumer banking" below. year-over-year, international gcb average deposits of $129 billion increased 5%, average retail loans of $99 billion increased 3%, investment sales of $78 billion decreased 8%, average card loans of $26 billion increased 2% and card purchase sales of $101 billion increased 6%, all excluding the impact of fx translation.
icg revenues were $33.7 billion in 2015, up 2% from the prior year. excluding cva/dva, icg revenues were largely unchanged from the prior year at $33.5 billion.
banking revenues of $16.9 billion, excluding cva/dva and the impact of mark-to-market gains on hedges related to accrual loans within corporate lending (see below), were largely unchanged compared to the prior year, as lower equity underwriting activity within investment banking as well as the impact of fx translation was offset by higher advisory revenues and continued growth in the private bank. investment banking revenues of $4.5 billion decreased 3% versus the prior year. advisory revenues increased 16% to $1.1 billion with sustained wallet share gains for the year. debt underwriting revenues increased 1% to $2.5 billion, driven by wallet share gains in investment grade debt and strong performance in investment grade loans in the second half of 2015, while equity underwriting revenues decreased 28% to $902 million, largely reflecting lower industry-wide underwriting activity during the year.
private bank revenues, excluding cva/dva, increased 8% to $2.9 billion from the prior year, driven by higher loan and deposit balances as well as growth in managed investments revenue. corporate lending revenues rose 8% to $2.0 billion, including $323 million of mark-to-market gains on hedges related to accrual loans compared to a $116 million gain in the prior year. excluding the impact of fx translation and the mark-to-market impact of loan hedges, corporate lending revenues increased 3% versus the prior year, as growth in average loans was partially offset by the impact of lower spreads. treasury and trade solutions revenues of $7.8 billion were relatively unchanged versus the prior year. excluding the impact of fx translation, treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 6%, as continued growth in deposit balances and spreads was partially offset by lower trade revenues.
markets and securities services revenues of $16.3 billion, excluding cva/dva, decreased 1% from the prior year. fixed income markets revenues of $11.3 billion, excluding cva/dva, decreased 7% from the prior year, as growth in rates and currencies was more than offset by a slowdown in spread products, reflecting the volatile trading environment during the year. equity markets revenues of $3.1 billion, excluding cva/dva, increased 13% versus the prior year driven by growth across all products. securities services revenues of $2.1 billion increased 4% versus the prior year, and increased 15% excluding the impact of fx translation, reflecting increased client activity and higher client balances. for additional information on the results of operations of icg for 2015, see "institutional clients group" below.
corporate/other revenues increased to $907 million from $301 million in the prior year, driven mainly by gains on debt buybacks during the course of 2015. for additional information on the results of operations of corporate/other in 2015, see "corporate/other" below.
citicorp end-of-period loans increased 1% to $573 billion from the prior year, as a 5% increase in corporate loans was partially offset by a 2% decrease in consumer loans. excluding the impact of fx translation, citicorp loans grew 5%, with 8% growth in corporate loans and 2% growth in consumer loans.
citi holdings citi holdings' net income was $1.0 billion in 2015, compared to a net loss of $3.5 billion in the prior year. cva/dva was negative $15 million (negative $10 million after-tax) in 2015, compared to negative $47 million (negative $29 million after-tax) in the prior year. excluding the impact of cva/dva in both periods and the impact of the mortgage settlement in the prior year, citi holdings' net income was $1.1 billion, compared to $275 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting lower expenses and lower credit costs.
citi holdings' revenues were largely unchanged from the prior year at $7.8 billion. excluding cva/dva, citi holdings' revenues decreased 1% to $7.9 billion from the prior year, primarily driven by the overall wind-down of the portfolio and the impact of redemptions of high cost debt, mostly offset by the impact of higher gains on asset sales. for additional information on the results of operations of citi holdings in 2015, see "citi holdings" below.
at the end of 2015, citi holdings' assets were $74 billion, 43% below the prior year, and represented approximately 4% of citi's total gaap assets. citi holdings' risk-weighted assets were $133 billion as of december 31, 2015, a decrease of 30% from the prior year, and represented 11% of citi's risk-weighted assets under basel iii (based on the advanced approaches for determining risk-weighted assets).

citicorp citicorp is citigroup's global bank for consumers and businesses and represents citi's core franchises. citicorp is focused on providing best-in-class products and services to customers and leveraging citigroup's unparalleled global network, including many of the world's emerging economies. citicorp is physically present in approximately 100 countries, many for over 100 years, and offers services in over 160 countries and jurisdictions. citi believes this global network provides a strong foundation for servicing the broad financial services needs of its large multinational clients and for meeting the needs of retail, private banking, commercial, public sector and institutional clients around the world.
citicorp consists of the following operating businesses: global consumer banking (which consists of consumer banking businesses in north america, emea, latin america and asia) and institutional clients group (which includes banking and markets and securities services). citicorp also includes corporate/other. at december 31, 2015, citicorp had approximately $1.7 trillion of assets and $901 billion of deposits, representing approximately 96% of citi's total assets and 99% of citi's total deposits.
consistent with its strategy to continue to efficiently allocate its resources and further simplify its global consumer bank, in february 2016, citi announced that it intends to exit its consumer businesses in argentina, brazil and colombia. these consumer businesses, consisting of approximately $6 billion of assets, $5 billion of consumer loans and $3 billion of deposits as of december 31, 2015, contributed approximately $1.1 billion of revenues, $900 million of expenses and a net loss of $34 million in 2015. these businesses, which previously have been reported as part of latin america gcb, will be reported as part of citi holdings beginning in the first quarter of 2016. see also "citigroup segments" above and "citi holdings" below. while citi does not intend to exit its consumer businesses in venezuela, these businesses are not significant, lending predominantly to support icg activities, and will be reported as part of icg beginning in the first quarter of 2016. similarly, citi's remaining indirect investment in banco de chile will be reported as part of icg beginning in the first quarter of 2016.

global consumer banking global consumer banking (gcb) consists of citigroup's four geographical consumer banking businesses that provide traditional banking services to retail customers through retail banking, including commercial banking, and citi-branded cards and citi retail services (for additional information on these businesses, see "citigroup segments" above). gcb is a globally diversified business with 2,994 branches in 24 countries around the world as of december 31, 2015. at december 31, 2015, gcb had approximately $394 billion of assets and $301 billion of deposits.
gcb's overall strategy is to leverage citi's global footprint and seek to be the preeminent bank for the emerging affluent and affluent consumers in large urban centers. in credit cards and in certain retail markets, citi serves customers in a somewhat broader set of segments and geographies. consistent with its strategy, since 2012, citi has exited, or is in the process of exiting, 20 consumer markets and has reduced its branch footprint by 25% to focus its global presence.

net income decreased by 4% due to lower loan loss reserve releases and lower revenues, partially offset by lower expenses and lower net credit losses.
revenues decreased 1%, reflecting lower revenues in citi-branded cards, partially offset by higher revenues in retail banking.
retail banking revenues increased 6%. the increase was primarily driven by 7% growth in average loans, 9% growth in average checking deposits, improved deposit spreads and slightly higher mortgage origination revenues, partially offset by lower net gains on branch sales (approximately $40 million) and mortgage portfolio sales (approximately $80 million) as well as a lower mortgage repurchase reserve release (approximately $50 million) compared to 2014. this growth in retail banking revenues occurred despite the fact that, consistent with gcb's strategy, during 2015, north america gcb closed or sold 69 branches (a 9% decline from the prior year), with announced plans to sell or close an additional 50 branches in the first quarter of 2016. with these actions, over 90% of north america gcb's retail banking footprint will be concentrated in its six key metropolitan areas.
cards revenues decreased 3% due to a 2% decline in average loans, partially offset by a 4% increase in purchase sales. in citi-branded cards, revenues decreased 6%, primarily reflecting an increase in acquisition and rewards costs, particularly during the second half of 2015 as north america gcb deployed its investment spending (as discussed below) to grow its new account acquisitions in its core products. north america gcb expects the increased acquisition and rewards costs within citi-branded cards to continue to negatively impact revenues in 2016. the decrease in citi-branded cards revenues was also due to the continued impact of lower average loans (down 4%), driven primarily by continued high customer payment rates during the year, partially offset by a 6% increase in purchase sales.
citi retail services revenues were largely unchanged as the continued impact of lower fuel prices, which negatively impacts purchase sales in the fuel portfolios, and higher contractual partner payments was offset by the impact of higher spreads and volumes (1% increase in average loans). the higher contractual partner payments resulted from the business sharing the benefits of higher yields and lower net credit losses with its retail partners. purchase sales were unchanged as the continued impact of lower fuel prices was offset by volume growth. north america gcb expects the negative impact of lower fuel prices on citi retail services revenues to continue in the near term.
expenses decreased 5%, primarily due to ongoing cost reduction initiatives, including as a result of the branch rationalization strategy, and lower repositioning charges, partially offset by increased investment spending (including marketing, among other areas) in citi-branded cards, which is expected to continue into 2016.
provisions increased 15% largely due to lower net loan loss reserve releases (73%), partially offset by lower net credit losses (11%). net credit losses declined in citi-branded cards (down 14% to $1.9 billion) and in citi retail services (down 8% to $1.7 billion). the lower loan loss reserve release reflected overall credit stabilization in the cards portfolios during 2015. as a result of this stabilization, north america gcb expects to experience modest loan loss reserve builds during 2016.
in addition to the trends discussed above expected to impact north america gcb's results of operations in 2016, north america gcb expects to make additional investments in its u.s. cards businesses during 2016, including investments in connection with citi's planned acquisition of the costco portfolio, the closing of which is currently expected to occur mid-2016, as well as the expected impact of renewing certain important partnership programs in a competitive environment (see also "risk factors-operational risks" below). while north america gcb believes these investments are necessary for the growth of its u.s. cards businesses, they will reduce the pretax earnings of the businesses during 2016.
net income increased by 13% due to lower net credit losses, higher loan loss reserve releases and lower expenses, partially offset by lower revenues.
revenues decreased 1%, with lower revenues in retail banking, partially offset by higher revenues in citi-branded cards and citi retail services. retail banking revenues of $4.9 billion decreased 9% due to lower mortgage origination revenues and spread compression in the deposit portfolios, partially offset by continued volume-related growth (average loans increased 9% and average deposits increased 3%) and gains from branch sales.
cards revenues increased 2% as average loans increased 3% versus 2013. in citi-branded cards, revenues increased 1% as a 4% increase in purchase sales and higher net interest spreads, driven by the continued reduction of promotional balances in the portfolio, mostly offset lower average loans. the decline in average loans was driven primarily by the reduction in promotional balances, and to a lesser extent, increased customer payment rates during the year.
citi retail services revenues increased 4%, primarily due to a 12% increase in average loans driven by the best buy acquisition in september 2013, partially offset by continued declines in fee revenues primarily reflecting higher yields and improving credit and the resulting increase in contractual partner payments. citi retail services revenues also benefited from lower funding costs, partially offset by a decline in net interest spreads due to a higher percentage of promotional balances within the portfolio.
expenses decreased 1% as ongoing cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by higher repositioning charges, increased investment spending and an increase in citi retail services expenses due to the impact of the best buy portfolio acquisition.
provisions decreased 18% due to lower net credit losses (9%) and higher loan loss reserve releases (21%). net credit losses declined in citi-branded cards (down 14% to $2.2 billion) and in citi retail services (down 2% to $1.9 billion). the loan loss reserve release increased due to the continued improvement in citi-branded cards, partially offset by a lower loan loss reserve release in citi retail services due to reserve builds for new loans originated in the best buy portfolio.

revenues increased 3%, primarily due to the approximately $180 million gain on sale in the third quarter of 2015 related to the mexico merchant acquiring business. excluding this gain, revenues increased 1% as the impact of modest volume growth was mostly offset by the absence of gains and revenues from businesses divested in 2014, including as a result of the sale of the honduras consumer business in the second quarter and the partial sale of citi's indirect investment in banco de chile in the first quarter, as well as continued spread compression in cards. revenues were also impacted by continued slow economic growth in the region during 2015.
retail banking revenues increased 6%, excluding the gain on sale related to the merchant acquiring business and the business divestitures in 2014. this increase in retail banking revenues reflected volume growth, including an increase in average loans (4%) and average deposits (5%), partially offset by a decline in investment sales (15%). cards revenues decreased 2%, primarily due to higher payment rates in mexico resulting from the business' focus on higher credit quality customers, consistent with gcb's strategy, as well as muted volumes (low purchase sales growth and unchanged average loans). cards revenues were also negatively impacted by ongoing shifts in consumer behavior, including due to the previously-disclosed regulatory reforms enacted in 2013 in mexico. latin america gcb expects the cards payment rate in mexico to remain elevated in 2016.
expenses increased 5%, primarily due to higher regulatory and compliance costs, higher technology spending and mandatory salary increases in certain countries, partially offset by lower repositioning charges, lower legal and related costs and ongoing efficiency savings.
provisions were unchanged as higher net credit losses were partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve build. net credit losses increased 1%, largely reflecting portfolio growth as well as net credit losses incurred in the commercial banking portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2015 associated with a wind-down portfolio in brazil, most of which was offset by the release of previously-established loan loss reserves. the higher net credit losses were partially offset by the absence of a $71 million charge-off in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to citi's homebuilder exposure in mexico. the net loan loss reserve build declined 13%, primarily due to lower builds related to mexico cards, partially offset by higher builds related to brazil in the second half of 2015, as well as the absence of the releases related to the mexico homebuilder exposure in 2014.

net income increased 7% as higher revenues were partially offset by higher expenses and credit costs.
revenues increased 4%, primarily due to volume growth and spread and fee growth in mexico, partially offset by continued spread compression in the region and slower overall economic growth in certain latin america markets, including mexico and brazil during 2014. retail banking revenues increased 3% as average loans increased 6%, investment sales increased 25% and average deposits increased 6%, partially offset by lower spreads in brazil and colombia. cards revenues increased 8% as average loans increased 5% and purchase sales increased 1%, excluding the impact of credicard's results in the prior-year period (for additional information, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). the increase in cards revenues was partially offset by lower economic growth and slowing cards purchase sales in mexico due to the regulatory reforms enacted during 2013, as referenced above.
expenses increased 5%, primarily due to mandatory salary increases in certain countries, higher legal and related costs, increased repositioning charges and higher technology spending, partially offset by productivity and repositioning savings.
provisions increased 5%, primarily due to higher net credit losses, which were partially offset by a lower loan loss reserve build. net credit losses increased 22%, driven by portfolio growth and continued seasoning in the mexico cards portfolio. net credit losses were also impacted by both the slower economic growth and regulatory reforms in mexico as well as the $71 million charge-off related to citi's homebuilder exposure in mexico.

revenues decreased 3%, primarily due to an industry-wide slowdown in investment sales, particularly in the second half of 2015, as well as spread compression and higher payment rates and the ongoing impact of regulatory changes in cards, partially offset by volume growth.
retail banking revenues decreased 2%, mainly due to a decline in investment sales revenue, particularly in taiwan, singapore, india, korea and indonesia, reflecting weaker customer confidence due to slowing economic growth and volatility in the capital markets, as well as spread compression, particularly in poland. this decline in revenues was partially offset by higher volumes, driven by lending (2% increase in average loans), deposit products (5% increase in average deposits) and higher insurance fee revenues. citi expects investment sales revenues could continue to be challenged in 2016, depending upon overall consumer sentiment, economic growth and the capital markets environment in the region.
cards revenues decreased 5%, primarily due to spread compression, including continued high payment rates, and the ongoing impact of regulatory changes, particularly in singapore, taiwan, australia, malaysia and poland, partially offset by modest volume growth (a 3% increase in average loans and a 5% increase in purchase sales). cards revenues were also impacted by the weaker customer confidence, primarily in the second half of 2015. spread compression and regulatory changes will likely continue to have a negative impact on cards revenues in the near term.
expenses decreased 4%, primarily due to the absence of repositioning charges in korea in 2014 and efficiency savings, partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance costs, investment spending, volume-related growth and compensation expense.

(1)   hedges on accrual loans reflect the mark-to-market on credit derivatives used to economically hedge the corporate loan accrual portfolio. the fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection.
(2)   funding valuation adjustments (fva) is included within cva for presentation purposes. for additional information, see note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.
the discussion of the results of operations for icg below excludes the impact of cva/dva for all periods presented. presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of cva/dva and the impact of gains/(losses) on hedges on accrual loans, are non-gaap financial measures. for a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.
net income decreased 4%, primarily driven by higher credit costs, partially offset by lower expenses.
•   revenues were largely unchanged, reflecting lower revenues in markets and securities services (decrease of 1%) and a modest increase in revenues in banking (increase of 1%, but unchanged excluding the gains/(losses) on hedges on accrual loans). citi expects revenues in icg, particularly in its markets and securities services businesses, will likely continue to reflect the overall market environment.
within banking:
•   investment banking revenues decreased 3%, largely reflecting an industry-wide activity decline in underwriting activity. advisory revenues increased 16%, reflecting increased target client activity and strength in the overall m&amp;a market. equity underwriting revenues decreased 28% driven by the lower market activity and a decline in wallet share resulting from continued share fragmentation. debt underwriting revenues increased 1%, driven by increased wallet share in investment grade debt and strong performance in investment grade loans in the second half of 2015, partially offset by the lower market activity and decreased wallet share in high-yield and leveraged loans.
•   treasury and trade solutions revenues were largely unchanged. excluding the impact of fx translation, revenues increased 6%, as continued growth in deposit balances across regions and improved spreads, particularly in north america, were partially offset by continued declines in trade balances and spreads. end-of-period deposit balances increased 3% (7% excluding the impact of fx translation), largely driven by asia and latin america. average trade loans decreased 12% (9% excluding the impact of fx translation), as the business maintained origination volumes while reducing lower spread assets and increasing asset sales to optimize returns (see "managing global risk-liquidity risk" below).
•   corporate lending revenues increased 8%. excluding the impact of gains/(losses) on hedges on accrual loans, revenues decreased 3%. excluding the impact of fx translation and gains/(losses) on hedges on accrual loans, revenues increased 3% as continued growth in average loan balances, lower hedge premium costs and an improvement in mark-to-market adjustments were partially offset by lower spreads, particularly in emea.
•   private bank revenues increased 8%, reflecting strength in north america, asia and emea, primarily due to growth in loan volumes and deposit balances, improved spreads in banking and higher managed investments revenues, partially offset by continued spread compression in lending.
within markets and securities services:
•   fixed income markets revenues decreased 7%, driven by north america, primarily due to a volatile trading environment during 2015 due to macroeconomic uncertainty. the decrease in fixed income markets revenues resulted from a decline in spread products revenues (credit markets, securitized markets and municipals), partially offset by strength in rates and currencies. rates and currencies revenues increased 4% due to higher revenues in local markets and overall g10 products, partially offset by g10 foreign exchange.
•   equity markets revenues increased 13%, primarily reflecting improved performance across products, including derivatives and prime finance, with strength in asia and emea.
•   securities services revenues increased 4%. excluding the impact of fx translation, revenues increased 15%, reflecting increased client activity and higher client balances.
expenses decreased 2% as efficiency savings, the impact of fx translation and lower repositioning charges were partially offset by increased regulatory and compliance costs and compensation expense.
provisions increased $872 million to $929 million, primarily reflecting a net loan loss reserve build ($722 million), compared to a net loan loss reserve release ($219 million) in 2014. the net loan loss reserve build included approximately $530 million for energy and energy-related exposures, including $250 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, due to the significant decline in commodity prices during the second half of 2015. (for additional information on citi's energy and energy-related exposures, see "managing global risk-credit risk-corporate credit" below.) the remainder of the build during 2015 was primarily due to volume growth and overall macroeconomic conditions.
the higher net loan loss reserve build during 2015 was partially offset by lower net credit losses. net credit losses decreased 25%, primarily due to the absence of net credit losses of approximately $165 million related to the petróleos mexicanos (pemex) supplier program, which were incurred during 2014 (for additional information, see citi's form 8-k filed with the sec on february 28, 2014), partially offset by increased net credit losses related to a limited number of energy and energy-related exposures, including approximately $75 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.
looking to 2016, cost of credit in icg will largely depend on the price of oil and other commodity prices as well as macroeconomic conditions. to the extent commodity prices remain at year-end 2015 levels, or deteriorate further, icg expects to incur additional loan loss reserve builds in its energy and energy-related portfolios, which could be significant, and citi's corporate non-accrual loans could be negatively impacted. such events as well as macroeconomic conditions could also negatively impact citi's other corporate credit portfolios.
net income increased 1%, primarily driven by lower expenses, largely offset by lower revenues. excluding the impact of the net fraud loss of $360 million in mexico in the fourth quarter of 2013, net income decreased 1%, primarily driven by the lower revenues and higher expenses, largely offset by lower credit costs.
•   revenues decreased 1%, reflecting lower revenues in markets and securities services (decrease of 8%), partially offset by higher revenues in banking (increase of 7%, or 5% excluding the gains/(losses) on hedges on accrual loans).
within banking:
•   investment banking revenues increased 7%, reflecting a stronger overall market environment and improved wallet share with icg's target clients, partially offset by a modest decline in overall wallet share. the decline in overall wallet share was primarily driven by equity and debt underwriting and reflected market fragmentation. advisory revenues increased 12%, reflecting the increased target client activity and an expansion of the overall m&amp;a market. equity underwriting revenues increased 18% largely in line with overall growth in market fees. debt underwriting revenues were largely unchanged.
•   treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 1%. excluding the impact of fx translation, revenues increased 3% as continued higher deposit balances, fee growth and trade activity were partially offset by the impact of spread compression globally. end-of-period deposit balances were unchanged, but increased 3% excluding the impact of fx translation, largely driven by north america. average trade loans decreased 9% (7% excluding the impact of fx translation).
•   corporate lending revenues increased 52%. excluding the impact of gains/(losses) on hedges on accrual loans, revenues increased 15%, primarily due to continued growth in average loan balances and lower funding costs.
•   private bank revenues increased 7% due to growth in client business volumes and improved spreads in banking, higher capital markets activity and an increase in assets under management in managed investments, partially offset by continued spread compression in lending.
within markets and securities services:
•   fixed income markets revenues decreased 11%, driven by a decrease in rates and currencies revenues, partially offset by increased securitized products and commodities revenues. rates and currencies revenues declined due to historically muted levels of volatility, uncertainties around russia and greece and lower client activity in the first half of 2014. in addition, the first half of 2013 included a strong performance in rates and currencies, driven in part by the impact of quantitative easing globally. municipals and credit markets revenues declined due to challenging trading conditions resulting from macroeconomic uncertainties, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2014. these declines were partially offset by increased securitized products and commodities revenues, largely in north america.
•   equity markets revenues decreased 1%, primarily reflecting weakness in emea, particularly cash equities, driven by volatility in europe, largely offset by improved performance in prime finance due to increased customer flows.
•   securities services revenues increased 4%. excluding the impact of fx translation, revenues increased 5% due to increased volumes, assets under custody and overall client activity.
expenses decreased 1% as efficiency savings, the absence of the net fraud loss and lower performance-based compensation were partially offset by higher repositioning charges and legal and related expenses as well as increased regulatory and compliance costs. excluding the impact of the net fraud loss, expenses increased 1%, as higher repositioning charges and legal and related expenses as well as increased regulatory and compliance costs were partially offset by efficiency savings and lower performance-based compensation.
provisions decreased 27%, primarily reflecting a release for unfunded lending commitments in the corporate loan portfolio, compared to a build in 2013, partially offset by higher net credit losses and a lower loan loss reserve release driven by the overall economic environment. net credit losses increased 52%, largely related to the pemex supplier program during 2014 as well as write-offs related to a specific counterparty.
corporate/other corporate/other includes certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and compliance), other corporate expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses, corporate treasury and discontinued operations. at december 31, 2015, corporate/other had $52 billion of assets, or 3% of citigroup's total assets. for additional information, see "managing global risk-liquidity risk" below.

net income was $423 million, compared to a net loss of $5.4 billion in 2014, largely reflecting significantly lower expenses, an increased tax benefit due to legal entity restructurings and resolution of certain state and local audits in the second quarter of 2015, as well as higher revenues.
revenues increased $606 million to $907 million, primarily due to gains on debt buybacks during the course of 2015 and real estate sales in the second quarter of 2015 as well as higher revenues from sales of afs securities, partially offset by hedging activities.
expenses decreased $4.3 billion to $1.8 billion, largely driven by lower legal and related expenses ($796 million compared to $4.4 billion in 2014), a benefit from fx translation and lower repositioning charges.
during the fourth quarter of 2015, a change was enacted to the dividend rate citi is entitled to receive on the shares of capital stock it is required to hold in the federal reserve system. pursuant to current requirements, citibank, n.a. (citibank) is required to purchase stock equal to 3% of its capital stock and surplus (with an additional 3% subject to call by the federal reserve board). as a result of the recent change, effective january 1, 2016, the statutory dividend citi is to receive on these shares will decrease from a fixed 6% to the lesser of (i) the high-yield rate paid on the 10-year u.s. treasury note based on the auction immediately preceding the dividend payment, and (ii) 6%. while the actual impact to corporate/other revenues (where citi records this dividend) will be based on the number of shares of federal reserve system capital stock it holds at any given time as well as the quarter-to-quarter operational activities impacting the result of operations of corporate/other, based on year-end amounts, citi estimates this change could negatively impact revenues in corporate/other by approximately $160 million annually going forward.
revenues decreased 7%, primarily driven by lower revenues from sales of afs securities as well as hedging activities.
expenses increased $5.0 billion to $6.0 billion, largely driven by the higher legal and related expenses ($4.4 billion compared to $172 million in 2013) as well as increased regulatory and compliance costs and higher repositioning charges.
citi holdings citi holdings contains the remaining businesses and portfolios of assets that citigroup has determined are not central to its core citicorp businesses. consistent with this determination, beginning in the first quarter of 2016, citi's consumer businesses in argentina, brazil and colombia will be reported as part of citi holdings (for additional information, see "citigroup segments" and "citicorp" above).
as of december 31, 2015, citi holdings assets were approximately $74 billion, a decrease of 43% year-over-year and 33% from september 30, 2015. the decline in assets of $36 billion from september 30, 2015 primarily consisted of divestitures and run-off, including, among others, completion of the sales of citi's retail banking and credit cards businesses in japan and onemain financial. as of december 31, 2015, citi had signed agreements to reduce citi holdings gaap assets by an additional $7 billion in 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.
also as of december 31, 2015, consumer assets in citi holdings were approximately $64 billion, or approximately 86% of citi holdings assets. of the consumer assets, approximately $38 billion, or 59%, consisted of north america mortgages (residential first mortgages and home equity loans). as of december 31, 2015, citi holdings represented approximately 4% of citi's gaap assets and 11% of its risk-weighted assets under basel iii (based on the advanced approaches for determining risk-weighted assets).

the discussion of the results of operations for citi holdings below excludes the impact of cva/dva for all periods presented. presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of cva/dva, are non-gaap financial measures. citi believes the presentation of citi holdings' results excluding the impact of cva/dva is a more meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of the business. for a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.
net income was $1.1 billion, an improvement from a net loss of $3.5 billion in 2014, largely due to the impact of the mortgage settlement in 2014 (see "executive summary" above). excluding the mortgage settlement, net income increased $782 million, primarily due to lower expenses and lower net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release. while citi holdings expects to have positive net income during 2016, given the significant asset sales and declines in overall citi holdings' assets during 2015, it does not expect to generate the same level of net income in 2016 as in 2015.
revenues decreased 1%, primarily driven by the overall wind-down of the portfolio, the impact of redemptions of high cost debt and the impact of recording onemain financial net credit losses as a reduction of revenue beginning in the second quarter of 2015, mostly offset by higher gains on asset sales, including in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the sales of onemain financial and the retail banking and credit cards businesses in japan.
expenses declined 52%. excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, expenses declined 22%, primarily due to the ongoing decline in assets and lower legal and related costs ($420 million compared to $986 million in 2014).
provisions decreased 26%. excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, provisions decreased 24%, driven by lower net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net loss reserve release. net credit losses declined 42%, primarily due to the impact of the recording of onemain financial net credit losses as a reduction in revenue, continued improvements in north america mortgages and overall lower asset levels. the net reserve release decreased 42%. excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, the net reserve release decreased 46% to $529 million, primarily due to lower releases related to the north america mortgage portfolio as the portfolio has been reduced and credit has improved.
the net loss increased by $1.6 billion to $3.5 billion, largely due to the impact of the mortgage settlement, partially offset by higher revenues and lower cost of credit. excluding the mortgage settlement, net income increased by $2.2 billion to $275 million, primarily due to lower expenses, lower net credit losses and higher revenues, partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release.
revenues increased 17%, primarily driven by gains on asset sales, including the sales of the consumer operations in greece and spain in the third quarter of 2014, lower funding costs and the absence of residential mortgage repurchase reserve builds for representation and warranty claims as compared to 2013, partially offset by losses on the redemption of debt associated with funding citi holdings assets.

the selling of ppi by financial institutions in the u.k. has been the subject of intense review and focus by u.k. regulators and, more recently, the u.k. supreme court. for additional information on ppi, see "citi holdings" in citi's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2013 filed with the sec on march 3, 2014.
ppi is designed to cover a customer's loan repayments if certain events occur, such as long-term illness or unemployment. the u.k. financial conduct authority (fca) found certain problems across the industry with how these products were sold, including customers not realizing that the cost of ppi premiums was being added to their loan or ppi being unsuitable for the customer. redress generally involves the repayment of premiums and the refund of all applicable contractual interest together with compensatory interest of 8%. in addition, during the fourth quarter of 2014, the u.k. supreme court issued a ruling in a case (plevin) involving ppi pursuant to which the court ruled, independent of the sale of the ppi contract, the ppi contract at issue in the case was "unfair" due to the high sales commissions earned and the lack of disclosure to the customer thereof.
during the fourth quarter of 2015, the fca issued a consultation paper that proposed (1) a deadline for ppi complaints (both non-plevin and plevin complaints) of two years after the effective date of the final rules; (2) an fca-led customer communications campaign in advance of the deadline, with bank funding of the campaign; and (3) a failure to disclose a sales commission of 50% or more would be deemed unfair when assessing a new ppi complaint and require a customer refund of the difference between the commission paid and 50%, plus interest. final rules are expected from the fca in spring 2016.
during 2015, citi increased its ppi reserves by approximately $153 million ($65 million of which was recorded in citi holdings and $88 million of which was recorded in discontinued operations), including a $106 million reserve increase in the fourth quarter of 2015 ($39 million of which was recorded in citi holdings and $67 million of which was recorded in discontinued operations). the increase for full year 2015 compared to an increase of $118 million during 2014. while the overall level of claims generally remained
unchanged in 2015, the increase in the reserves during 2015, including in the fourth quarter of 2015, was due in part to the plevin case and the guidelines set forth in the fca's consultation paper, including the proposed customer communications campaign.
citi's year-end 2015 ppi reserve was $262 million (compared to $225 million as of december 31, 2014).
additional reserving actions, if any, in 2016 will largely depend on the timing of and response to the fca's final rules, including the level of customer response to any communications campaign.
off-balance sheet arrangements citigroup enters into various types of off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business. citi's involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including without limitation:
•   purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in unconsolidated special purpose entities, such as credit card receivables and mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization entities;
•   holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships and equity interests in other unconsolidated special purpose entities;
•   providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties; and
•   entering into operating leases for property and equipment.
citi enters into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes. for example, securitization arrangements offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. securitization arrangements also assist citi and citi's customers in monetizing their financial assets and securing financing at more favorable rates than citi or the customers could otherwise obtain.
the table below shows where a discussion of citi's various off-balance sheet arrangements may be found in this form 10-k. in addition, see notes 1, 22 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements.

(2)   contractual obligations related to interest payments on long-term debt for 2016-2020 are calculated by applying the december 31, 2015 weighted-average interest rate (3.32%) on average outstanding long-term debt to the average remaining contractual obligations on long-term debt for each of those years. the "thereafter" interest payments on long-term debt for the remaining years to maturity (2021-2098) are calculated by applying current interest rates on the remaining contractual obligations on long-term debt for each of those years.
(3)   purchase obligations consist of obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on citi. for presentation purposes, purchase obligations are included in the table above through the termination date of the respective agreements, even if the contract is renewable. many of the purchase agreements for goods or services include clauses that would allow citi to cancel the agreement with specified notice; however, that impact is not included in the table above (unless citi has already notified the counterparty of its intention to terminate the agreement).
(4)   other liabilities reflected on citigroup's consolidated balance sheet includes accounts payable, accrued expenses, uncertain tax positions and other liabilities that have been incurred and will ultimately be paid in cash; legal reserve accruals are not included in the table above. also includes discretionary contributions in 2016 for citi's employee-defined benefit obligations for the pension, postretirement and postemployment plans and defined contribution plans.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary fiscal 2015 included the following notable items:
•   comparable sales grew 2.1 percent. digital channel sales growth of more than 30 percent contributed 0.8 percentage points to 2015 comparable sales growth.
•   we returned cash through share repurchase for the first time since second quarter 2013, with purchases of $3,441 million of common stock at an average price of $77.07 per share.
sales were $73,785 million for 2015, an increase of $1,167 million or 1.6 percent from the prior year. earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes in 2015 increased by $995 million or 22.0 percent from 2014 to $5,530 million. operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $5,140 million, $5,131 million, and $7,519 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. proceeds from the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses to cvs are included in investing cash flows provided by continuing operations. in 2013, operating cash flow provided by continuing operations includes $2.7 billion of proceeds from the sale of our u.s. credit card receivables.
we report after-tax return on invested capital (roic) from continuing operations as we believe roic provides a meaningful measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time. for the trailing twelve months ended january 30, 2016, roic was 16.0 percent, compared with 12.4 percent for the trailing twelve months ended january 31, 2015. excluding the net gain on the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses, roic was 13.9 percent for the trailing twelve months ended january 30, 2016. a reconciliation of roic is provided on page 24.
pharmacies and clinics transaction in december 2015, we closed the previously announced sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses to cvs for cash consideration of $1.9 billion. cvs now operates the pharmacy and clinic businesses in our stores under a perpetual operating agreement, subject to termination in limited circumstances. no profit-sharing arrangement exists, but cvs will make an annual, inflation-adjusted occupancy-related payment to us, starting at $20 million to $25 million in the first year of the agreement. we also entered into a development agreement with cvs through which we may jointly develop small-format stores.
in connection with the sale, we recognized a pretax gain of $620 million, which we recorded outside of segment results and excluded from adjusted eps. we also recorded deferred income of $694 million, which we will amortize into income evenly over the 23-year weighted average remaining accounting useful life of our stores.
during 2015, we used a portion of the $1.9 billion cash consideration to repurchase shares of our common stock and settle approximately $200 million of retained pharmacy and clinic net liabilities. we expect to use the remaining proceeds to pay approximately $500 million of related taxes and repurchase shares.
had this transaction closed prior to this year, our 2015 reported sales and cost of goods sold would have been lower by approximately $3.8 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, with no notable effect on ebitda or ebit.
this transaction is expected to be accretive to eps in every period following the closing, and should add 50 basis points or more to roic over time. in addition, due to the lower sales base without a significant effect on profits, we expect the transaction to have a favorable impact on our ebitda and ebit margin rates.
refer to note 6 of the financial statements for additional information about the transaction.
ebitda                              7,340           6,837           6,857             7.4              (0.3   )

note: effective january 15, 2015, we operate as a single segment which includes all of our continuing operations, excluding net interest expense, data breach related costs, and certain other expenses which are discretely managed. our segment operations are designed to enable guests to purchase products seamlessly in stores or through our digital sales channels. beginning with the first quarter of 2015, segment ebit includes the impact of the reduction of the beneficial interest asset. for comparison purposes, prior years' segment ebit has been revised. see note 30 of our financial statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to earnings before income taxes.
(a)   sg&amp;a includes credit card revenues and expenses for all periods presented prior to the march 2013 sale of our u.s. consumer credit card portfolio to td. for 2015, 2014, and 2013, sg&amp;a also includes $641 million, $629 million, and $555 million, respectively, of net profit-sharing income from the arrangement with td.

sales sales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, and gift card breakage. refer to note 2 of the financial statements for a definition of gift card breakage. the increase in 2015 and 2014 sales reflects an increase in comparable sales of 2.1 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, and the contribution from new stores, partially offset by a decrease in 2015 of approximately $550 million due to the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses. inflation did not materially affect sales in any period presented.

comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. comparable sales include all sales, except sales from stores open less than 13 months, digital acquisitions operating less than one year, stores that have been closed, and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate. pharmacy and clinic sales for the comparable period following the sale to cvs are excluded from the calculation. comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry. as a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

(e)   includes furniture, lighting, kitchenware, small appliances, home décor, bed and bath, home improvement, automotive, and seasonal merchandise such as patio furniture and holiday décor.
further analysis of sales metrics is infeasible due to the collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive, and consumer behavioral factors, as well as sales mix and transfer of sales to new stores.
td offers credit to qualified guests through target-branded credit cards: the target credit card and the target mastercard credit card (target credit cards). additionally, we offer a branded proprietary target debit card. collectively, we refer to these products as redcards®. guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases and free shipping at target.com when they use a redcard. we monitor the percentage of sales that are paid for using redcards (redcard penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our redcards are also incremental sales for target.
target debit card           12.1   %    11.2   %     9.9   %
target credit cards         10.1   9.7         9.3
note: excluding pharmacy and clinic sales, total redcard penetration would have been 23.2 percent, 21.9 percent, and 20.1 percent for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. the sum of target credit cards and target debit card penetration may not equal total redcard penetration due to rounding.
gross margin rate our gross margin rate was 29.5 percent in 2015, 29.4 percent in 2014, and 29.8 percent in 2013. the 2015 increase was primarily due to favorable category sales mix and lower promotional activity relative to the highly promotional period in 2014 following the 2013 data breach, partially offset by the impact of increased digital channel sales.
the 2014 decrease was primarily due to promotional activity.
selling, general and administrative expense rate our sg&a expense rate was 19.6 percent in 2015, 20.0 percent in 2014, and 20.2 percent in 2013. the decrease in 2015 primarily resulted from cost saving initiatives and reduced marketing expense, partially offset by investments in other initiatives, none of which were individually significant. we will continue to seek efficiency savings to reinvest in our business; however, we do not expect the sg&a rate to continue to decline at the pace realized during 2014 and 2015.
the decrease in 2014 was primarily related to cost savings initiatives, partially offset by investments in technology and other initiatives, none of which were individually significant.
other performance factors other selling, general and administrative expenses we recorded $216 million, $174 million, and $81 million of selling, general and administrative expenses outside of the segment during 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. additional information about these items is provided within the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to gaap measures on page 23 and note 30 of the financial statements.
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate from continuing operations decreased to 32.5 percent in 2015, from 33.0 percent in 2014, driven primarily by the $112 million tax benefit that resulted from releasing the valuation allowance on a capital loss related to our canada exit. this benefit is recorded in continuing operations as the release of the valuation allowance is attributable to a capital gain generated by the cvs transaction. the tax rate benefit from this valuation allowance release was partially offset by a year-over-year decrease in the favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the rate impact of higher pretax earnings. the resolution of various income tax matters reduced tax expense by $8 million and $35 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. note 23 of the financial statements provides a tax rate reconciliation.
discontinued operations on january 15, 2015, target canada co. and certain other wholly owned subsidiaries of target (collectively canada subsidiaries), comprising substantially all of our former canadian operations and our former canadian segment, filed for protection (the filing) under the companies' creditors arrangement act (ccaa) with the ontario superior court of justice in toronto (the court) and were deconsolidated. as a result, we recorded a pretax impairment loss on deconsolidation and other charges, collectively totaling $5.1 billion. the canada subsidiaries are executing a liquidation through the ccaa process.
in the fourth quarter of 2015, we reached settlements with two entities that controlled guaranteed leases representing approximately 46 percent of the recorded accrual at that time. under the settlement terms, these entities have subrogated to us their claims against the canada subsidiaries. the settlement amounts were materially consistent with our previously recorded accruals.
as part of a march 2016 settlement between the canada subsidiaries and all of their former landlords, we have agreed to subordinate a portion of our intercompany claims and make certain cash contributions to the estate in exchange for a full release from obligations under guarantees of certain leases. this agreement remains subject to creditor and court approval. the financial impact of this agreement is materially consistent with amounts recorded in our financial statements.
for more information about our canada exit, see note 7 of the financial statements.
reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to gaap measures to provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-gaap adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (adjusted eps). this metric excludes the impact of the 2015 sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses, the 2013 sale of our u.s. consumer credit card receivables portfolio, losses on early retirement of debt, net expenses related to the 2013 data breach, and other matters presented below. we believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our continuing operations. this measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the united states (gaap). the most comparable gaap measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. adjusted eps from continuing operations should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under gaap. other companies may calculate non-gaap adjusted eps from continuing operations differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies. prior year amounts have been revised to present adjusted eps on a continuing operations basis.
(d)   for 2015, represents impairments related to our decision to wind down certain noncore operations. refer to note 16 of the financial statements for more information. 2014 includes impairments of $16 million related to undeveloped land in the u.s. and $13 million of expense related to converting co-branded card program to mastercard. 2013 includes a $23 million workforce-reduction charge primarily related to severance and benefits costs, a $22 million charge related to part-time team member health benefit changes, and $19 million in impairment charges related to certain parcels of undeveloped land.
we have also disclosed after-tax return on invested capital for continuing operations (roic), which is a ratio based on gaap information, with the exception of adjustments made to capitalize operating leases. operating leases are capitalized as part of the roic calculation to control for differences in capital structure between us and our competitors. we believe this metric provides a meaningful measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time. other companies may calculate roic differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources our period-end cash and cash equivalents balance increased to $4,046 million from $2,210 million in 2014, primarily reflecting the proceeds from the sale of the pharmacy and clinic businesses. due to the timing of the sale late in 2015, we did not fully deploy the net proceeds by the end of 2015. short-term investments of $3,008 million and $1,520 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2015 and 2014, respectively. our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. this policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. we also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments.
cash flows our 2015 operations were funded by internally generated funds. operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $5,140 million in 2015 compared with $5,131 million in 2014. proceeds from the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses to cvs are included in investing cash flows provided by continuing operations. these cash flows, combined with period year-end cash position, allowed us to invest in the business, pay dividends and repurchase shares under our share repurchase program.
inventory year-end inventory was $8,601 million, compared with $8,282 million in 2014. the increase was due to investments to drive growth in certain merchandise categories, improve in-stocks, and earlier receipts of certain merchandise.
dividends we paid dividends totaling $1,362 million in 2015 and $1,205 million in 2014, an increase of 13.0 percent. we declared dividends totaling $1,378 million ($2.20 per share) in 2015, a per share increase of 10.6 percent over 2014. we declared dividends totaling $1,271 million ($1.99 per share) in 2014, a per share increase of 20.6 percent over 2013. we have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.
short-term and long-term financing our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility, and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities. within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. as of january 30, 2016, our credit ratings were as follows:
credit ratings     moody's   standard and poor's   fitch long-term debt     a2        a                     a-
if our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above.
in 2015, we funded our peak holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds. in 2014, we funded our peak holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper.
we have additional liquidity through a committed $2.25 billion revolving credit facility that expires in october 2018. no balances were outstanding at any time during 2015, 2014, or 2013 under this facility.
most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. in addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. we are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. additionally, at january 30, 2016, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control and (ii) our long-term credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.
we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund obligations incurred as a result of our exit from canada, pay dividends, and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future. our exit from canada increased our after-tax cash flows beginning in 2015. we continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and long-term financing.
capital expenditures capital expenditures                                      2015                2014                2013
capital expenditures decreased in 2015 from the prior year as we opened fewer large-format stores and realized efficiency gains in technology, partially offset by increased guest experience and supply chain investments. capital expenditures were less than our initial expectations reflecting efficiency gains in technology combined with the impact of project timing shifts as we aligned investments against specific initiatives to drive growth, invest in our supply chain, and build out our omnichannel capabilities. capital expenditures decreased in 2014 from the prior year due to fewer remodels and new stores, partially offset by increased technology investments to support our omnichannel efforts and security enhancements.
we expect capital expenditures in 2016 to return to a level comparable with 2013 and 2014.
commitments and contingencies contractual obligations as of                                                                           payments due by period january 30, 2016                                                 less than             1-3             3-5       after 5

(b)   these payments also include $311 million and $90 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores that are expected to open in 2016 or later for capital and operating leases, respectively. capital lease obligations include interest. see note 22 of the financial statements for further information.
(c)   deferred compensation obligations include commitments related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. the timing of deferred compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees, forecasted investment returns, and the projected timing of future retirements.
(d)   real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities.
(f)   estimated loss contingencies, including those related to the canada exit and the 2013 data breach, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. see note 7 and note 19 of the financial statements for further information.
(g)   purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments, and service contracts. we issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. we do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. if we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. we also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met.
(h)   real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction, or remodeling of real estate and facilities.
(i)   we have not included obligations under our pension plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of january 30, 2016. our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate.
off balance sheet arrangements:    other than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above, we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements.
critical accounting estimates our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap. preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. in the notes to consolidated financial statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ under other assumptions or conditions. however, except as discussed below regarding canada exit-related costs, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future
estimates or assumptions. our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit & finance committee of our board of directors. the following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment:
inventory and cost of sales:    we use the retail inventory method to account for the majority of our inventory and the related cost of sales. under this method, inventory is stated at cost using the last-in, first-out (lifo) method as determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's ending retail value. the cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory, freight costs incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution centers and stores, and import costs, reduced by vendor income and cash discounts. the majority of our distribution center operating costs, including compensation and benefits, are expensed to cost of sales in the period incurred. since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market. we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts. historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change, including changing consumer demand, guest preferences, changing consumer credit markets, or increasing competition. we believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. inventory was $8,601 million and $8,282 million at january 30, 2016 and january 31, 2015, respectively, and is further described in note 12 of the financial statements.
vendor income receivable:    cost of sales and sg&a expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors (vendor income). vendor income is earned for a variety of programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, advertising allowances, and compliance programs. we establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received. based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned. the majority of year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. excluding pharmacy-related receivables, which were insignificant at period-end, vendor income receivable was $379 million and $426 million at january 30, 2016 and january 31, 2015, respectively. the vendor income receivable balance is described further in note 4 of the financial statements.
long-lived assets:    long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount. measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value, as appropriate. we recorded impairments of $54 million, $124 million, and $77 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, which are described further in note 14. as of january 30, 2016, a 10 percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell or close would result in additional impairment of $7 million in 2015. historically, we have not realized material losses upon sale of long-lived assets.
investments in and receivables from canada subsidiaries:    we determined the fair value and recoverability of our canadian investments by comparing the estimated fair value of the underlying assets of the canada subsidiaries to estimated liabilities. we estimated the fair value of the major asset classes using estimated selling price less cost to sell, the income approach based on estimated market rents and capitalization rates, and discounted cash flow analysis of the differential between estimated market rent and contractual rent payments, as appropriate. we also applied an estimated liquidation discount to reflect the ccaa filing.
outstanding liabilities include accounts payable and other liabilities, forward commitments, unsubordinated related party payables, lease liabilities, and other potential claims. potential claims include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to claims that may be asserted against the canada subsidiaries under certain contracts. based on our estimates, the fair value of liabilities exceeds the fair value of assets.
to assess the fair value and recoverability of amounts receivable from the canada subsidiaries, we estimated the fair value of the underlying net assets of the canada subsidiaries available for distribution to their creditors in relation to the estimated creditor claims and the priority of those claims.
our estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information, an assessment of the validity of certain claims, and estimated payments by the canada subsidiaries. our ultimate recovery is subject to the final liquidation value of the canada subsidiaries and may vary significantly from our current estimates. see note 7 of the financial statements for further information.
insurance/self-insurance:    we retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss, and team member medical and dental claims. however, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. we use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. general liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $498 million and $566 million at january 30, 2016 and january 31, 2015, respectively. we believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. for example, a five percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our self-insurance expense by $25 million in 2015. historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. refer to item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. we maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events, including network security matters.
income taxes:    we pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations, and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. we periodically reassess these probabilities, and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, were $215 million and $195 million at january 30, 2016 and january 31, 2015, respectively, and primarily relate to continuing operations. we believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. income taxes are described further in note 23 of the financial statements.
pension accounting:    we maintain a funded qualified, defined benefit pension plan, as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans for certain current and retired team members. the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire, and/or length of service. the benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long-term rate of return, the discount rate, and compensation growth rates. the assumptions, with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes, are used to determine the period-end benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year.
our 2015 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.5 percent is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance, and current market conditions. our compound annual rate of return on qualified plans' assets was 8.4 percent, 7.2 percent, 6.8 percent, and 8.5 percent for the 5-year, 10-year, 15-year, and 20-year periods, respectively. a one percentage point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase annual expense by $35 million. based on a change in our asset allocation policy in late 2015, our expected long-term rate of return is 6.8 percent for 2016.
the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. a 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $32 million.
based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.
pension benefits are further described in note 28 of the financial statements.
legal and other contingencies:    we are exposed to other claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents. when a loss is probable, we record an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss. when no point of loss is more likely than another, we record the lowest amount in the estimated
range of loss and disclose the estimated range. we do not record liabilities for reasonably possible loss contingencies, but do disclose a range of reasonably possible losses if they are material and we are able to estimate such a range. if we cannot provide a range of reasonably possible losses, we explain the factors that prevent us from determining such a range. historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material.
we believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable. with the exception of canada exit-related loss exposures, we do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation may materially affect our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. however, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. if an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. refer to note 7 of the financial statements for further information on the canada exit-related contingencies, respectively.
new accounting pronouncements in february 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02, leases, to require organizations that lease assets to recognize the rights and obligations created by those leases on the balance sheet. the new standard is effective in 2019, with early adoption permitted.  we are currently evaluating the effect the new standard will have on our financial statements.

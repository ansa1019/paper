our common equity tier 1 capital ratio, as calculated under the basel iii standardized approach, including transition provisions, was 11.1% and 12.5% as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we formally entered parallel run for basel iii advanced approaches on january 1, 2015. see "md&a-capital management" below for additional information.
on march 11, 2015, we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.125 billion of shares of our common stock ("2015 stock repurchase program"). through the end of 2015, we repurchased approximately $1.875 billion of shares of common stock as part of this program and expect to complete the 2015 stock repurchase program by the end of the second quarter of 2016. on february 17, 2016, we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $300 million of shares of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2016 under the 2015 stock repurchase program. see "md&a-capital management" below for additional information.
below are additional highlights of our performance in 2015. these highlights are generally based on a comparison between the results of 2015 and 2014, except as otherwise noted. the changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of december 31, 2015, compared to our financial condition and credit performance as of december 31, 2014. we provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this "executive summary and business outlook."

•   earnings: our net income decreased by $378 million to $4.1 billion in 2015, compared to 2014. the decrease in net income from continuing operations in 2015 was driven by (i) an increase in the provision for credit losses in our domestic credit card loan portfolio due to a larger allowance build in 2015 due to continued loan growth coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rates, and higher charge-offs as new loan balances season; (ii) an increase in the provision for credit losses in our commercial loan portfolio due to a larger build in both the allowance and reserve for unfunded lending commitments resulting from adverse market conditions impacting our oil and gas portfolio and taxi medallion lending portfolio; and (iii) an increase in non-interest expense driven by higher operating and marketing expenses associated with loan growth and continued technology and infrastructure investments. in 2015, we recorded charges totaling $150 million for severance and related benefits pursuant to our ongoing benefit programs and certain site closures, as a result of the realignment of our workforce. we also recorded a build in the u.k. payment protection insurance customer refund reserve ("u.k. ppi reserve") of $147 million in 2015, reflecting recent u.k. regulatory developments and updated estimates of future complaint levels. these expenses were partially offset by (i) higher interest income due to growth in our credit card, commercial and auto loan portfolios, partially offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio; and (ii) an increase in non-interest income primarily attributable to higher net interchange fees, partially offset by lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily driven by the continued run-off of our payment protection products in our domestic card business. the increase in net income from discontinued operations in 2015 was primarily driven by a reduction in our mortgage representation and warranty reserve in 2015 resulting from favorable industry legal developments.
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment increased by $21.5 billion to $229.9 billion as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014 and average loans held for investment increased by $12.8 billion to $210.7 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. the increases were primarily driven by continued growth in our credit card, auto and commercial loan portfolios, including loans acquired from the ge healthcare acquisition, partially offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.
•   net charge-off and delinquency statistics: our net charge-off rate increased by 3 basis points to 1.75% in 2015 compared to 2014. net charge-off rates remained low compared to our long-term trends, while we experienced rising losses in our taxi medallion lending portfolio and oil and gas portfolio within our commercial banking business. our 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 9 basis points to 3.00% as of december 31, 2015, from december 31, 2014, primarily due to the seasoning of recent credit card loan originations and adverse market conditions impacting our taxi medallion lending portfolio. we provide additional information on our credit quality metrics below under "business segment financial performance" and "credit risk profile."
•   allowance for loan and lease losses: our allowance for loan and lease losses increased by $747 million to $5.1 billion as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014. the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by continued loan growth, coupled with our expectations of rising charge-off rates in our domestic credit card portfolio driven by growth, as well as adverse market conditions impacting our oil and gas portfolio and taxi medallion lending portfolio in our commercial banking business. these factors also contributed to a higher allowance coverage ratio, which increased by 13 basis points to 2.23% as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014.

(3)   some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our commercial banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications within the other category.
(4)   includes the residual impact of the allocation of our centralized corporate treasury group activities, unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments and other items as described in "note 20-business segments."
credit card: our credit card business generated net income from continuing operations of $2.4 billion in 2015, compared to net income from continuing operations of $2.5 billion in 2014. the decrease in net income in 2015 was primarily attributable to (i) higher provision for credit losses driven by a larger allowance build in our domestic credit card loan portfolio in 2015 due to continued loan growth coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rates, as well as higher charge-offs as new loan balances season; and (ii) higher non-interest expense due to higher operating and marketing expenses associated with loan growth. these drivers were partially offset by (i) higher net interest income primarily driven by loan growth; and (ii) higher non-interest income attributable to an increase in net interchange fees, partially offset by a decline in service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the continued run-off of our payment protection products in our domestic card business. period-end loans held for investment increased by $10.2 billion to $96.1 billion as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014, primarily due to loan growth in our domestic card business.
consumer banking: our consumer banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $1.0 billion in 2015, compared to net income from continuing operations of $1.2 billion in 2014. the decrease in net income in 2015 was primarily attributable to higher non-interest expense largely driven by increased operating expenses due to growth in our auto loan portfolio and continued technology and infrastructure investments in our retail banking business, as well as higher provision for credit losses due to a higher build in the allowance build for loan and lease losses in our consumer banking business, coupled with higher net charge-offs driven by growth in our auto loan portfolio. period-end loans held for investment decreased by $1.1 billion to $70.4
commercial banking: our commercial banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $570 million in 2015, compared to net income from continuing operations of $659 million in 2014. the decrease in net income in 2015 was primarily attributable to (i) higher provision for credit losses due to a larger build in both the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments resulting from adverse market conditions impacting our oil and gas portfolio and taxi medallion lending portfolio, and (ii) higher non-interest expense largely driven by higher operating expenses due to costs associated with the ge healthcare acquisition and continued growth in our commercial banking business. these expenses were partially offset by higher net interest income driven by growth in commercial and multifamily real estate and commercial and industrial average loans and higher non-interest income driven by increased revenue from products and services provided to our commercial customers. period-end loans held for investment increased by $12.4 billion to $63.3 billion as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014, driven by the ge healthcare acquisition, as well as loan growth in our commercial and multifamily real estate and commercial and industrial loan portfolios.
business outlook we discuss below our current expectations regarding our total company performance and the performance of each of our business segments over the near-term based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and our business strategies as of the time we filed this annual report on form 10-k. the statements contained in this section are based on our current expectations regarding our outlook for our financial results and business strategies. our expectations take into account, and should be read in conjunction with, our expectations regarding economic trends and analysis of our business as discussed in "part i-item 1. business" and "part ii-item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of this report. certain statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. actual results could differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. except as otherwise disclosed, forward-looking statements do not reflect: (i) any change in current dividend or repurchase strategies; (ii) the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that have not been previously disclosed; or (iii) any changes in laws, regulations or regulatory interpretations, in each case after the date as of which such statements are made. see "part i-item 1. business-forward-looking statements" in this report for more information on the forward-looking statements included in this report and "part i-item 1a. risk factors" in this report for factors that could materially influence our results.
total company expectations our strategies and actions are designed to deliver and sustain strong returns and capital generation through the acquisition and retention of franchise-enhancing customer relationships across our businesses. we believe that franchise-enhancing customer relationships create and sustain significant long-term value through long and loyal customer relationships and a gradual build in loan balances and revenues over time. examples of franchise-enhancing customer relationships include rewards customers in our credit card business, retail deposit customers in our consumer banking business and primary banking relationships with commercial customers in our commercial banking business. we intend to grow these customer relationships by continuing to invest in scalable infrastructure and operating platforms, so that we can meet the heightened risk management expectations facing all banks and deliver a "brand-defining" customer experience that builds and sustains a valuable, long-term customer franchise.
we delivered revenue growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns in 2015, highlighted by strong growth in our domestic card business. in 2016, we expect full year growth in revenues, driven by loan growth. we expect some improvement in the full year 2016 efficiency ratio compared to 2015, with continuing improvement in 2017, excluding adjusting items.
we believe our actions have created a balance sheet with strong capital and liquidity. pursuant to our approved 2015 capital plan, we increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.30 per share to $0.40 per share starting in the second quarter of 2015. we also expect to complete the repurchase of up to $3.125 billion of shares of our common stock pursuant to the 2015 stock repurchase program through the second quarter of 2016. the timing and exact amount of any common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, opportunities for growth, and our capital position and amount of retained earnings. the 2015 stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. see "md&a-capital management-dividend policy and stock purchases" for more information.

business segment expectations credit card: in our domestic card business, we expect the upward pressure on delinquencies and charge-offs as new loan balances season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio will continue through 2016 and begin to moderate in 2017. we continue to expect the full-year 2016 charge-off rate to be around four percent, with quarterly seasonal variability. based on current information and assuming relative stability in consumer behavior, the domestic economy, and competitive conditions, we expect the full-year 2017 charge-off rate in the low four percent range, with quarterly seasonal variability. loan growth coupled with our expectations for a rising charge-off rate drove an allowance build in the fourth quarter, and we expect loan growth to drive allowance additions going forward.
consumer banking: in our consumer banking business, we expect persistently low interest rates will continue to pressure returns in our deposit businesses in 2016. we expect planned run-off from our acquired home loan portfolio to continue in 2016. we also expect continued pressure on margins in our auto business due to the mix shift toward prime and continuing competitive pressure. we expect these trends will negatively affect revenues in 2016.
commercial banking: organic growth in our commercial banking business is slowing compared to prior years because of actions we are taking in response to market conditions. while competition in the commercial banking business remains intense, pressuring margin and returns, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty industry verticals. credit performance remains strong for the majority of our commercial businesses, but credit pressures continue in our oil and gas portfolio and taxi medallion lending portfolio. unless oil prices rebound it is likely that energy loans will drive increases in our criticized and non-performing loans, further allowance additions, and possibly increasing charge-offs in 2016.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on the consolidated financial statements. understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. we provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies."
we have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. these critical accounting policies govern:
•   customer rewards reserves we evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them, as necessary, based on changing conditions. management has discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors.
loan loss reserves we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses that represents management's estimate of incurred loan and lease losses inherent in our held-for-investment credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking loan portfolios as of each balance sheet date. we also separately reserve for binding unfunded lending commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees.
we build our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments through the provision for credit losses. our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by charge-offs, changes to allowance for loan and lease losses, and
39      capital one financial corporation (cof)
changes to unfunded lending commitments. we recorded a provision for credit losses of $4.5 billion in 2015 and $3.5 billion in both 2014 and 2013.
we have an established process, using analytical tools and management judgment, to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses. losses are inherent in our loan portfolio and we calculate the allowance for loan and lease losses by estimating incurred losses for segments of our loan portfolio with similar risk characteristics and record a provision for credit losses. the allowance totaled $5.1 billion as of december 31, 2015, compared to $4.4 billion as of december 31, 2014.
we review and assess our allowance methodologies and adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses on a quarterly basis. our assessment involves evaluating many factors including, but not limited to, historical loss and recovery experience, recent trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, risk ratings, the impact of bankruptcy filings, the value of collateral underlying secured loans, account seasoning, changes in our credit evaluation, underwriting and collection management policies, seasonality, general economic conditions, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance for loan and lease losses. key factors that have a significant impact on our allowance for loan and lease losses include assumptions about unemployment rates, home prices, and the valuation of commercial properties and other collateral, consumer real estate, and automobiles.
in addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we review and assess our estimate of probable losses related to binding unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit and financial guarantees, and unfunded loan commitments on a quarterly basis. the factors impacting our assessment generally align with those considered in our evaluation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial banking business. changes to the reserve for losses on unfunded lending commitments are recorded through the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income and to other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
although we examine a variety of externally available data, as well as our internal loan performance data, to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments, our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties, including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance. accordingly, our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations. we provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses for each of our loan portfolio segments in "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies." we provide information on the components of our allowance, disaggregated by impairment methodology, and changes in our allowance in "note 6-allowance for loan and lease losses."
finance charge and fee reserves finance charges and fees on credit card loans, net of amounts that we consider uncollectible, are included in loan receivables and revenue when the finance charges and fees are earned. we continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is charged-off; however, when we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees, we reduce the balance of our credit card loan receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue. total net revenue was reduced by $732 million, $645 million and $796 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees. the finance charge and fee reserve totaled $262 million as of december 31, 2015, compared to $216 million as of december 31, 2014.
we review and assess the adequacy of the uncollectible finance charge and fee reserve on a quarterly basis. our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for incurred losses on the principal portion of our credit card loan receivables.
asset impairment in addition to our loan portfolio, we review other assets for impairment on a regular basis in accordance with applicable impairment accounting guidance. this process requires significant management judgment and involves various estimates and assumptions. our investment securities, goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets excluding loans. accordingly, below we describe our process for assessing impairment of these assets and the key estimates and assumptions involved in this process.
40      capital one financial corporation (cof)
investment securities we regularly review our investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment ("otti") using both quantitative and qualitative criteria. if we intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value is recognized in income. if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate other quantitative and qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists. our evaluation requires significant management judgment and a consideration of many factors, including, but not limited to, the extent and duration of the impairment; the health of and specific prospects for the issuer, including whether the issuer has failed to make scheduled interest or principal payments; recent events specific to the issuer and/or industry to which the issuer belongs; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings; the value of underlying collateral and current market conditions. quantitative criteria include assessing whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows. see "note 4-investment securities" for additional information.
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to january 1, 2009 represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired. goodwill resulting from business combinations after january 1, 2009, is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date.
goodwill totaled $14.5 billion and $14.0 billion as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increase was primarily attributable to $500 million of goodwill recognized as part of the ge healthcare acquisition. see "note 2-business developments" for additional information. intangible assets, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets, consist primarily of purchased credit card relationships ("pccr") and core deposit intangibles. the net carrying amount of intangible assets decreased to $1.0 billion as of december 31, 2015, from $1.3 billion as of december 31, 2014. goodwill and intangible assets together represented 5% of our total assets as of both december 31, 2015 and 2014. we did not recognize material impairment on goodwill or intangible assets in 2015, 2014 or 2013.
goodwill goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, on an annual basis or in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below. the goodwill impairment test, performed as of october 1 of each year, is a two-step test. the first step identifies whether there is potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the second step of the impairment test is required to measure the amount of any potential impairment loss.
estimating the fair value of reporting units and the assets, liabilities and intangible assets of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments. the fair value of reporting units is calculated using a discounted cash flow calculation, a form of the income approach. the calculation uses projected cash flows based on each reporting unit's internal forecast and the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. these cash flows and terminal values are then discounted using discount rates based on our external cost of equity with adjustments for risk inherent in each reporting unit. cash flows are adjusted, as necessary, in order to maintain each reporting unit's equity capital requirements. our discounted cash flow analysis requires management to make judgments about future loan and deposit growth, revenue growth, credit losses, and capital rates. discount rates used in 2015 for the reporting units ranged from 8% to 13%. the key inputs into the discounted cash flow analysis were consistent with market data, where available, indicating that assumptions used were within a reasonable range of observable market data.
we calculate the carrying amounts of our reporting units using an allocated capital approach based on each reporting unit's specific regulatory capital, economic capital requirements, and underlying risks. the total of the reporting unit carrying amount for the october 1, 2015 annual goodwill impairment test was $35.1 billion, compared to consolidated equity of $47.7 billion as of september 30, 2015. of the $12.6 billion remaining equity, $8.2 billion was primarily attributable to the following items: capital allocated to our other category, preferred stock, and capital that was reserved for dividends and share buy-backs that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2015. the remaining unallocated equity of approximately $4.4 billion, which represented approximately 9% of our total equity, has been reserved for potential future capital needs.
41      capital one financial corporation (cof)
we compare the total reporting unit carrying amounts to our total consolidated stockholders' equity to assess the appropriateness of our methodology. if the second step of goodwill impairment testing is required for a reporting unit, we would undertake an extensive effort to build the specific reporting unit's balance sheet for the test based on applicable accounting guidance. based on our analysis, the current fair value exceeded the carrying amount of all reporting units as of our annual testing date; therefore, the second step of impairment testing was unnecessary.
intangible assets intangible assets with definitive useful lives are amortized over their estimated lives and evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's or asset group's carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. an impairment loss, generally calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying amount. see "note 8-goodwill and intangible assets" for additional information.
fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date (also referred to as an exit price). the fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. this hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2: observable market-based inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 3: unobservable inputs the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices in active markets or observable market parameters. when quoted prices and observable data in active markets are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. changes in market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value.
we have developed policies and procedures to determine when markets for our financial assets and liabilities are inactive if the level and volume of activity has declined significantly relative to normal conditions. if markets are determined to be inactive, it may be appropriate to adjust price quotes received. when significant adjustments are required to price quotes or inputs, it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs.
significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain financial instruments measured at fair value are classified as level 2 or level 3. in making this determination, we consider all available information that market participants use to measure the fair value of the financial instrument, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the level 3 inputs to the instruments' fair value measurement in its entirety. if level 3 inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as level 3. the process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions.
42      capital one financial corporation (cof)
we have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties. our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types, price verification and review of valuation judgments, methods, models, process controls and results. groups independent from our trading and investing functions, including our corporate valuations group ("cvg"), fair value committee ("fvc") and model validation group, participate in the review and validation process. the fair valuation governance process is set up in a manner that allows the chairperson of the fvc to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved at the fvc to a more senior committee called the valuations advisory committee ("vac") for resolution. the vac is chaired by the chief financial officer and includes other senior management. the vac is only required to convene to review escalated valuation disputes; however, it met once during 2015 for a general update on the valuation process.
the cvg performs periodic verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable. for example, in cases where we rely on third party pricing services to obtain fair value measures, we analyze pricing variances among different pricing sources and validate the final price used by comparing the information to additional sources, including dealer pricing indications in transaction results and other internal sources, where necessary. additional validation procedures performed by the cvg include reviewing (either directly or indirectly through the reasonableness of assigned fair values) valuation inputs and assumptions, and monitoring acceptable variances between recommended prices and validation prices. the cvg and the trade analytics and valuation team ("tav") perform due diligence reviews of the third party pricing services by comparing their prices with prices from other sources and reviewing other control documentation. additionally, when necessary, the cvg and tav challenge prices from third-party vendors to ensure reasonableness of prices through a pricing challenge process. this may include a request for a transparency of the assumptions used by the third party.
the fvc, which includes representation from business areas, our risk management division and our finance division, is a forum for discussing fair market valuations, inputs, assumptions, methodologies, variance thresholds, valuation control environment and material risks or concerns related to fair market valuations. additionally, the fvc is empowered to resolve valuation disputes between the primary valuation providers and the cvg. it provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment. the fvc regularly reviews and approves our valuation methodologies to ensure that our methodologies and practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance. the chief financial officer determines when material issues or concerns regarding valuations shall be raised to the audit committee or other delegated committee of the board of directors.
we have a model policy, established by an independent model risk office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing. the model validation group is part of the model risk office and validates all models and provides ongoing monitoring of their performance, including the validation and monitoring of the performance of all valuation models.
representation and warranty reserve in connection with the sales of mortgage loans, certain subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the loan's compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser, including underwriting guidelines and the ongoing existence of mortgage insurance, and the loan's compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. we may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan, indemnify the investor or insurer, or reimburse the investor for losses incurred on the loan in the event of a material breach of contractual representations or warranties.
we have established representation and warranty reserves for losses that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary, including both litigation and non-litigation liabilities. the reserve-setting process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires the application of judgment. in establishing the representation and warranty reserves, we rely on historical data and consider a variety of factors, depending on the category of purchaser. these factors include, but are not limited to, the historical relationship between loan losses and repurchase outcomes; the percentage of current and future loan defaults that we anticipate will result in repurchase requests over the lifetime of the loans; the percentage of those repurchase requests that we anticipate will result in actual repurchases; and estimated collateral valuations. we evaluate these factors and update our loss forecast models on a quarterly basis to estimate our lifetime liability.
our aggregate representation and warranty mortgage reserve, which we report as a component of other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $610 million and $731 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by us or one of our subsidiaries will depend on, among other things, actual future mortgage loan performance, the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests, the actual success rates of claimants,
43      capital one financial corporation (cof)
developments in litigation, actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices).
as part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the potential future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental accrual under applicable accounting standards. our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond what was in our reserve as of december 31, 2015 is approximately $1.6 billion, a decline from our estimate of $2.1 billion as of december 31, 2014. notwithstanding our ongoing attempts to estimate a reasonably possible amount of future losses beyond our current accrual levels based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and our current estimate of the amount of reasonably possible losses. this estimate involves considerable judgment, and reflects that there is still significant uncertainty regarding the numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels, including, but not limited to, anticipated litigation outcomes, future repurchase and indemnification claim levels, ultimate repurchase and indemnification rates, future mortgage loan performance levels, actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices). in light of the significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability our subsidiaries may incur from these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. see "note 21-commitments, contingencies, guarantees and others" for additional information.
customer rewards reserve we offer products, primarily credit cards, which include programs that allow members to earn rewards, in the form of points, that can be redeemed for cash (primarily in the form of statement credits), gift cards, airline tickets or merchandise, based on account activity. the amount of rewards that a customer earns varies based on the terms and conditions of the rewards program and product. the majority of our rewards do not expire and there is no limit on the number of rewards points an eligible card member can earn. customer rewards costs, which we generally record as an offset to interchange income, are driven by various factors, such as card member purchase volume, the terms and conditions of the rewards program and rewards redemption cost. we establish a customer rewards reserve that reflects management's judgment regarding rewards earned that are expected to be redeemed and the estimated redemption cost.
we use financial models to estimate ultimate redemption rates of rewards earned to date by current card members based on historical redemption trends, current enrollee redemption behavior, card product type, year of program enrollment, enrollment tenure and card spend levels. our current assumption is that the vast majority of all rewards earned will eventually be redeemed. we use a weighted-average cost per reward redeemed during the previous twelve months, adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption costs, including mix of rewards redeemed, to estimate future redemption costs. we continually evaluate our reserve and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, changes to the terms and conditions of the rewards program and other factors. changes in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted-average cost per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the reserve through the current period provision by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by card members as of the end of the reporting period. we recognized customer rewards expense of $2.7 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.6 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. our customer rewards liability, which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $3.2 billion and $2.7 billion as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
accounting changes and developments accounting for derivative assets and liabilities as of january 1, 2015, we changed our accounting principle to move from a gross basis of presentation to a net basis, for presenting qualifying derivative assets and liabilities, as well as the related fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable), for instruments executed with the same counterparty where a right of setoff exists. this newly adopted policy is preferable as it more accurately reflects the company's counterparty credit risk as well as our contractual rights and obligations under these arrangements. further, this change will align our presentation with that of the majority of our peer institutions. we retrospectively adopted this change in accounting principle and our consolidated balance sheet has been recast for all prior periods presented.

consolidated results of operations the section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for 2015, 2014 and 2013. following this section, we provide a discussion of our business segment results. you should read this section together with our "executive summary and business outlook," where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations.
net interest income net interest income represents the difference between the interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense on our interest-bearing liabilities. interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and other borrowings. generally, we include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem collectible. our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest bearing funding. we expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

(1)   as of january 1, 2015, we changed our accounting principle to move from a gross basis of presentation to a net basis, for presenting qualifying derivative assets and liabilities, as well as the related right to reclaim cash collateral or obligation to return cash collateral. see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for additional information. prior period results have been recast to conform to this presentation.
(3)   interest income and interest expense and the calculation of average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities include the impact of hedge accounting.
net interest income increased by $1.0 billion to $18.8 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase was primarily driven by growth in our credit card and commercial loan portfolios, as well as our auto loan portfolio in our consumer banking business.
46      capital one financial corporation (cof)
net interest margin decreased by 1 basis point to 6.66% in 2015 compared to 2014. the relatively consistent net interest margin reflected continued growth in our domestic card loan portfolio and the planned run-off of the acquired home loan portfolio in our consumer banking business, as well as lower wholesale funding costs; offset by the impact of declining yields in our auto, commercial, credit card and investment securities portfolios. the lower yield in the international credit card loan portfolio also reflected the impact from the build in the u.k. ppi reserve in the second and third quarters of 2015.
net interest income decreased by $288 million to $17.8 billion in 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease was primarily driven by the portfolio sale in 2013, partially offset by growth in commercial, auto and credit card loan portfolios, lower funding costs and higher yielding investment securities in 2014. net interest margin decreased by 13 basis points to 6.67% in 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease was primarily due to lower average loan yields driven by the portfolio sale in 2013 and a shift in the mix of the loan portfolio to lower yielding commercial and auto loans, partially offset by a reduction in our cost of funds and higher yielding investment securities.
table 3 displays the change in our net interest income between periods and the extent to which the variance is attributable to (i) changes in the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; or (ii) changes in the interest rates related to these assets and liabilities.

(1)   we calculate the change in interest income and interest expense separately for each item. the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. when the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive.
non-interest income non-interest income primarily consists of interchange income net of rewards expense, service charges and other customer-related fees, and other non-interest income. other non-interest income includes the pre-tax net benefit for mortgage representation and warranty losses related to continuing operations, gains and losses from the sale of investment securities, gains and losses on derivatives not accounted for in hedge accounting relationships, and hedge ineffectiveness.

non-interest income increased by $107 million to $4.6 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily driven by an increase in interchange fees due to higher purchase volume in our credit card business, partially offset by (i) increased rewards expense due to a greater proportion of customers with rewards coupled with increased spend on products with higher rewards; and (ii) lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the continued run-off of our payment protection products in our domestic card business.
non-interest income increased by $194 million to $4.5 billion in 2014 compared to 2013. the main drivers included an increase in net interchange fees due to strong purchase volume in our credit card loan portfolio, partially offset by a decline in our service charges and other customer-related fees due to strategic choices we made related to our domestic card business.
provision for credit losses our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs, changes to the allowance for loan and lease losses and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. we recorded a provision for credit losses of $4.5 billion in 2015 and $3.5 billion in both 2014 and 2013. the provision for credit losses as a percentage of net interest income was 24.1%, 19.9% and 19.1% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
our provision for credit losses increased by $995 million in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase was primarily driven by (i) a larger allowance build in our domestic credit card loan portfolio in 2015 due to continued loan growth coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rates, as well as higher charge-offs as new loan balances season; and (ii) a larger build in both the allowance and reserve for unfunded lending commitments resulting from adverse market conditions impacting our oil and gas portfolio and taxi medallion lending portfolio in our commercial banking business.
the increase in the provision for credit losses of $88 million in 2014 compared to 2013, was primarily driven by a small allowance build of $68 million in 2014 due to loan growth in our domestic card, auto and commercial portfolios, as compared to a release of $552 million in 2013 due to an improved credit outlook coupled with improvements in delinquency inventories in our domestic card portfolio, which were observed in 2014; partially offset by lower net charge-offs of $520 million in 2014 compared to 2013, mainly due to continued economic improvement and portfolio seasoning in our credit card loan portfolio.
we provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses within "credit risk profile-summary of allowance for loan and lease losses," "note 5-loans" and "note 6-allowance for loan and lease losses." for information on the allowance methodology for each of our loan categories, see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies."

non-interest expense non-interest expense consists of ongoing operating expenses, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional services, communications and data processing expenses and other non-interest expenses, as well as marketing costs and amortization of intangibles.

non-interest expense increased by $816 million to $13.0 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase was primarily due to (i) higher personnel expenses and charges for severance and related benefits pursuant to our ongoing benefit programs and certain site closures, as a result of the realignment of our workforce; (ii) higher operating and marketing expenses associated with loan growth, as well as acquisition and operating expenses related to the ge healthcare acquisition; and (iii) continued technology and infrastructure investments. these increases were partially offset by a decline in the amortization of intangibles.
non-interest expense decreased by $173 million, to $12.2 billion in 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease reflects a decline in the amortization of intangibles and a reduction in acquisition-related costs and provision for litigation matters. these were partially offset by (i) higher marketing expenses associated with loan growth; (ii) higher operating expenses attributable to growth in our commercial and auto loan portfolios; and (iii) the change to include auto repossession-related expenses as a component of operating expenses (prior to january 1, 2014 these costs were reported as a component of net charge-offs), partially offset by lower bankcard, regulatory and other fee assessments and communications and data processing expenses.
income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax income (loss) from discontinued operations reflects ongoing costs, which primarily consist of mortgage loan repurchase representation and warranty charges, related to the mortgage origination operations of our former wholesale mortgage banking unit, greenpoint mortgage funding, inc. ("greenpoint"), which was closed in 2007. income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $38 million in 2015, compared to income from discontinued operations of $5 million in 2014 and a loss from discontinued operations of $233 million in 2013. we recorded a benefit net of tax for mortgage representation and warranty reserve of $41 million ($64 million before tax) in 2015, compared to a $4 million benefit net of tax ($7 million before tax) and a provision net of tax of $210 million ($333 million before tax) in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
we provide additional information on the net provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses and the related reserve for representation and warranty claims in "consolidated balance sheets analysis-mortgage representation and warranty reserve" and "note 21-commitments, contingencies, guarantees and others."

income taxes we recorded income tax provisions of $1.9 billion (31.8% effective income tax rate), $2.1 billion (32.7% effective income tax rate), $2.2 billion (33.8% effective income tax rate) in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations varies between periods due, in part, to fluctuations in our pre-tax earnings, which affects the relative tax benefit of tax-exempt income, tax credits and other permanent tax items.
the decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2015, from 2014, was primarily due to lower income before taxes, higher discrete tax benefits and increased net tax credits. this decrease was partially offset by a reduced benefit of lower taxed foreign earnings.
the decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2014, from 2013, was primarily attributable to increased net tax credits and tax exempt income, and reductions in state rates, partially offset by increased discrete tax expenses.
we recorded net discrete tax benefits of $15 million in 2015, and net discrete tax expenses of $33 million and $16 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. our effective income tax rate, excluding the impact of discrete tax items discussed above, was 32.0%, 32.2% and 33.6% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
we provide additional information on items affecting our income taxes and effective tax rate under "note 18-income taxes."
business segment financial performance our principal operations are currently organized into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking. the operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized corporate treasury group, are included in the other category.
the results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. we may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. we use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results. our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. total interest income and net fees are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. the net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds transfer pricing process, which is primarily based on a matched maturity method that takes into consideration market rates. our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our consumer banking and commercial banking businesses, and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment. the allocation process is unique to each business segment and acquired businesses. we regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods.
we refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our "managed" presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on u.s. gaap. there is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to u.s. gaap; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. in addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with u.s. gaap.
below we summarize our business segment results for 2015, 2014 and 2013 and provide a comparative discussion of these results. we also discuss changes in our financial condition and credit performance statistics as of december 31, 2015, compared to december 31, 2014. we provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in "note 20-business segments." additionally, we provide information on the outlook for each of our business segments as described above under "executive summary and business outlook."

credit card business the primary sources of revenue for our credit card business are interest income, net interchange income and fees collected from customers. expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment, professional services, communications and data processing expenses and marketing expenses.
our credit card business generated net income from continuing operations of $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

key factors affecting the results of our credit card business for 2015, compared to 2014, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 include the following:
•   non-interest income: non-interest income increased by $110 million to $3.4 billion in 2015. the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume, partially offset by (i) increased rewards expense due to a greater proportion of customers with rewards coupled with increased spend on products with higher rewards; and (ii) lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the continued run-off of our payment protection products in our domestic card business.
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses increased by $667 million to $3.4 billion in 2015, primarily driven by a larger allowance build in our domestic credit card loan portfolio in 2015 due to continued loan growth coupled with our expectations for rising charge-off rates, as well as higher charge-offs as new loan balances season.
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense increased by $439 million to $7.5 billion in 2015. the increase was due to higher operating and marketing expenses associated with loan growth, partially offset by operating efficiencies and lower intangibles amortization expense.
•   net charge-off and delinquency statistics: the net charge-off rate decreased by 10 basis points to 3.36% in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by our international card loan portfolio which benefited from the ramp up of our international partnership portfolio in canada. the 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 10 basis points to 3.40% as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014 due to the seasoning of our domestic card portfolio growth which has begun to put upward pressure on delinquencies.
key factors affecting the results of our credit card business for 2014, compared to 2013, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013 include the following:
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses decreased by $74 million to $2.8 billion in 2014. the decrease was due to lower net charge-offs, partially offset by an absence of a release in the allowance for loan and lease losses that was incurred in 2013 related to the domestic card loan portfolio.
52      capital one financial corporation (cof)
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense decreased by $376 million to $7.1 billion in 2014. the decrease was largely due to (i) lower acquisition-related costs; (ii) lower operating expenses driven by the portfolio sale; (iii) operating efficiencies; and (iv) lower provision for litigation matters; partially offset by higher marketing expenses. non-interest expense also included pccr intangible amortization of $369 million in 2014.
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment increased by $4.6 billion to $85.9 billion as of december 31, 2014 from december 31, 2013. this increase was primarily driven by growth in the domestic card loan portfolio. average loans held for investment decreased by $261 million to $78.9 billion in 2014 compared to 2013, due to the run-off of certain loans acquired in the 2012 u.s. card acquisition, as well as the portfolio sale in 2013, partially offset by growth in the second half of 2014.
domestic card business domestic card generated net income from continuing operations of $2.2 billion in both 2015 and 2014, and $2.4 billion in 2013. domestic card accounted for 91% of total net revenues of our credit card business in 2015, compared to 90% in both 2014 and 2013. income attributable to domestic card represented 95% of net income of our credit card business in 2015, compared to 90% and 91% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the higher portion of total net revenue attributable to domestic card was primarily due to strong loan growth in our domestic business, the impact of foreign exchange rates driven by the strengthening of the u.s. dollar, as well as the build in our u.k. ppi reserve in our international card business.table 6.1 summarizes the financial results for domestic card and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.

(1)   we recognize billed finance charges and fee income on open-ended loans in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements and estimate the uncollectible amount on a quarterly basis. the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees is reflected as a reduction in revenue and is not included in our net charge-offs.

(5)   represents the net reduction in interest income attributable to the amortization of premiums on purchased loans accounted for based on contractual cash flows and the accretion of other intangibles associated with the 2012 u.s. card acquisition.
because our domestic card business accounts for the substantial majority of our credit card business, the key factors driving the results discussed above are similar to the key factors affecting our total credit card business. net income for our domestic card business remained flat in 2015, compared to 2014 as continued loan growth drove increases in both revenue and expenses, including provision for credit losses, and operating and marketing expenses.
the primary driver of the decline in net income for our domestic card business in 2014, compared to 2013, was a decrease in revenue primarily driven by the portfolio sale and higher marketing expenses, partially offset by lower acquisition-related costs and provision for litigation matters, as well as lower operating expenses attributable to the portfolio sale in 2013 and operating efficiencies.
the increase of net income in 2014, compared to 2013, was primarily due to a lower provision for credit losses, attributable to lower net charge-offs resulting from credit improvement, partially offset by lower non-interest income due to a decrease in service charges and other customer-related fees.

key factors affecting the results of our consumer banking business for 2015, compared to 2014, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 include the following:
consumer banking loan yield remained flat at 6.3% in 2015, as the decrease in average loan yield in our auto loan portfolio was offset by changes in the product mix in consumer banking as a result of growth in our auto loan portfolio and the planned run-off of the acquired home loan portfolio. the increase in our auto loan portfolio in relation to our total consumer banking loan portfolio drove an increase in the total consumer banking yield, even as the average yield on auto loans decreased by 65 basis points to 8.0% in 2015. this decrease was primarily attributable to two factors: (i) a shift to a higher proportion of prime auto loans; and (ii) continued competition across the auto business. the average yield on the home loan portfolio increased by 6 basis points to 3.9% in 2015, as a result of higher yield on our acquired home loan portfolio.
•   non-interest income: non-interest income increased by $26 million to $710 million in 2015, primarily due to the gain recognized on loans originated and sold within our home loan portfolio.
57      capital one financial corporation (cof)
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses increased by $116 million to $819 million in 2015, driven by an allowance build across our consumer banking loan portfolios, coupled with higher net charge-offs due to continued growth in our auto loan portfolio.
•   deposits: period-end deposits increased by $4.6 billion to $172.7 billion as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014, primarily driven by our continued focus on deposit relationships with existing customers and attracting new customers.
•   net charge-off and delinquency statistics: the net charge-off rate increased by 8 basis points to 1.03% in 2015 compared to 2014. the 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 44 basis points to 4.67% as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014. the increase in the net charge-off rate and 30+ day delinquency rate reflected the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio, which generally does not have charge-offs or delinquencies since these loans were recorded at fair value at acquisition, and a greater portion of auto loans in our portfolio, which have a higher charge-off and delinquency rate than other products within the total consumer banking loan portfolio.
key factors affecting the results of our consumer banking business for 2014, compared to 2013, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013 include the following:
•   net interest income: net interest income decreased by $157 million to $5.7 billion in 2014. the decrease in net interest income was primarily attributable to compression in deposit spreads in retail banking due to the lower interest rate environment, declining home loan portfolio balances, and margin compression in our auto loan portfolio. the decreases were partially offset by higher net interest income generated by growth in our auto loan portfolio.
consumer banking loan yields increased by 16 basis points to 6.3% in 2014. the increase in 2014 was driven by changes in the product mix in consumer banking as a result of growth in our auto loan portfolio and the run-off of the acquired home loan portfolio. the increase in our auto loans in relation to our total consumer banking loan portfolio drove an increase in the total consumer banking yield, even as the average yield on auto loans decreased by 109 basis points to 8.7% in 2014. this decrease was primarily attributable to a shift to a higher portion of prime auto loans and increased competition in the auto business. the average yield on home loans portfolio increased by 38 basis points to 3.8% in 2014. the higher yield in the home loan portfolio was driven by an increase in expected cash flows as a result of credit improvement on the acquired home loan portfolio.
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses increased by $47 million to $703 million in 2014. the increase in 2014, as compared to 2013, was driven by higher net charge-offs due to the growth in our auto loan portfolio and a smaller release of the allowance for loan and lease losses in the retail banking and home loan portfolios, offset by a smaller allowance build in the auto loan portfolio.
58      capital one financial corporation (cof)
•   deposits: period-end deposits increased by $426 million to $168.1 billion as of december 31, 2014, from december 31, 2013.
commercial banking business the primary sources of revenue for our commercial banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from customer fees and other transactions. because we have some investments that generate tax-exempt income or tax credits, we make certain reclassifications to our commercial banking business results to present revenues on a taxable-equivalent basis. expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy, equipment, professional services, communications and data processing expenses, as well as marketing expenses.

(1)   the average yield on loans held for investment is calculated by dividing interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. interest income excludes various allocations including funds transfer pricing that assigns certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses attributable to each business segment. some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our commercial banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35%.
(2)   the provision for unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. we recorded a reserve for unfunded lending commitments of $161 million, $106 million and $80 million as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
(3)   the period-end commercial banking loans held for investment include acquired loans with carrying value of $958 million and $191 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the average balance of commercial banking loans held for investment includes acquired loans of $215 million, $217 million and $303 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. see "md&amp;a-glossary and acronyms" for the definition of "acquired loans."
key factors affecting the results of our commercial banking business for 2015, compared to 2014, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 include the following:
•   net interest income: net interest income increased by $114 million to $1.9 billion in 2015. the increase was due to growth in commercial and industrial and commercial and multifamily real estate average loans, partially offset by lower loan yields driven by market and competitive pressures.
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses increased by $209 million to $302 million in 2015. the increase was primarily driven by a larger build in both the allowance and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments resulting from adverse market conditions impacting our oil and gas portfolio and taxi medallion lending portfolio. see "md&amp;a-table 17-commercial loans by industry" for additional information about the composition of our commercial banking loan portfolio, and "note 5-loans" for additional information about credit metrics for our commercial banking loan portfolio.
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense increased by $73 million to $1.2 billion in 2015, driven by higher operating expenses due to costs associated with the ge healthcare acquisition and continued growth in our commercial banking business.
•   loans held for investment: period-end loans held for investment increased by $12.4 billion to $63.3 billion as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014 driven by the ge healthcare acquisition as well as growth in our commercial
60      capital one financial corporation (cof)
•   deposits: period-end deposits increased by $2.3 billion to $34.3 billion as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014, driven by our strategy to strengthen existing relationships with and increase liquidity from our commercial customers.
•   net charge-off and nonperforming statistics: the net charge-off rate increased by 7 basis points to 0.09% in 2015 compared to 2014. the nonperforming loans rate increased by 53 basis points to 0.87% as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014. the increases in these rates reflect losses and credit risk rating downgrades in our oil and gas portfolio and taxi medallion lending portfolio.
key factors affecting the results of our commercial banking business for 2014, compared to 2013, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013 include the following:
•   net interest income: net interest income increased by $77 million to $1.8 billion in 2014. the increase was driven by growth in commercial and multifamily real estate and commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by lower loan yields driven by market and competitive pressures.
•   provision for credit losses: the provision for credit losses increased by $117 million to $93 million in 2014, primarily due to the change from an allowance release in 2013 driven by credit improvements, to an allowance build in 2014 attributable to loan growth and portfolio specific risks. the above impact was partially offset by a smaller reserve build due to lower growth in unfunded lending commitments.
•   non-interest expense: non-interest expense increased by $125 million to $1.1 billion in 2014, driven by operating expenses associated with continued investments in business growth.
•   deposits: period-end deposits increased by $1.4 billion to $32.0 billion as of december 31, 2014 from december 31, 2013, driven by our strategy to deepen and expand relationships with commercial customers.
•   net charge-off statistics: the net charge-off rate decreased by 1 basis point to 0.02% in 2014. the nonperforming loans rate increased by 1 basis point to 0.34% as of december 31, 2014 from december 31, 2013. the continued strength in the credit metrics in our commercial banking business reflects stable credit trends.
other category other includes unallocated amounts related to our centralized corporate treasury group activities, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management, and certain capital management activities. other also includes foreign exchange-rate fluctuations on foreign currency-denominated balances; unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain acquisition and restructuring charges; a portion of the net provision (benefit) for representation and warranty losses related to continuing operations; and offsets related to certain line-item reclassifications.

(1)   some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits, accordingly we make certain reclassifications within our commercial banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35%, with offsetting reclassifications within the other category.
net income from continuing operations recorded in the other category was $54 million in 2015, compared to $90 million in 2014. the reduction in net income in 2015 was primarily due to charges associated with (i) severance and related benefits pursuant to our ongoing benefit program as a result of the realignment of our workforce; and (ii) certain planned site closures, partially offset by higher discrete tax benefits and net tax credits.
net income from continuing operations recorded in the other category was $90 million in 2014, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $443 million in 2013. the shift to a net profit from a net loss was primarily due to lower funding costs, as well as the absence of the one-time charge associated with our redemption of trust preferred securities in january 2013.

consolidated balance sheets analysis total assets increased by $25.9 billion to $334.0 billion as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014 primarily attributable to (i) an increase of $21.5 billion in loans held for investment due to growth in our credit card, auto and commercial portfolios, including loans acquired from the ge healthcare acquisition, partially offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio; and (ii) an increase of $1.7 billion in investment securities due to purchases outpacing sales, maturities and paydowns. total liabilities increased by $23.7 billion to $286.8 billion as of december 31, 2015, primarily driven by higher deposit and outstanding debt due to new issuances outpacing maturities. stockholders' equity increased by $2.2 billion to $47.3 billion as of december 31, 2015, primarily due to our net income of $4.1 billion in 2015 and $1.5 billion of proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock, partially offset by $2.4 billion of share repurchases under our 2014 and 2015 stock repurchase programs and dividend payments.
the following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during 2015. period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to ensure the adequacy of capital while managing our liquidity requirements for the company and our customers and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite.
investment securities our investment portfolio consists primarily of the following: u.s. treasury securities; corporate debt securities guaranteed by u.s. government agencies; u.s. government-sponsored enterprise or agency ("agency") and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities ("rmbs") and commercial mortgage-backed securities ("cmbs"); other asset-backed securities ("abs"); and other securities. the carrying value of our investments in u.s. treasury, agency securities and other securities guaranteed by the u.s. government or agencies of the u.s. government represented 90% and 86% of our total investment securities portfolio as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the fair value of our securities available for sale portfolio was $39.1 billion as of december 31, 2015, a decrease of $447 million from $39.5 billion as of december 31, 2014. the decrease was primarily due to higher interest rates. the fair value of our securities held to maturity portfolio was $25.3 billion as of december 31, 2015, an increase of $1.7 billion from $23.6 billion as of december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily due to growth in this portfolio as purchases outpaced maturities and paydowns, slightly offset by decreases in fair value due to higher interest rates.
gross unrealized gains on available for sale investment securities decreased to $578 million as of december 31, 2015 compared to $886 million as of december 31, 2014 primarily driven by an increase in interest rates. gross unrealized losses on available for sale investment securities increased to $321 million as of december 31, 2015 compared to $237 million as of december 31, 2014. of the $321 million as of december 31, 2015, $165 million was related to securities that had been in a loss position for 12 months or longer. we provide information on otti recognized in earnings on our investment securities above in "consolidated results of operations-non-interest income."

(3)   includes foreign government bonds, corporate securities, municipal securities and equity investments.
credit ratings our portfolio of investment securities continues to be concentrated in securities that generally have high credit ratings and low credit risk, such as securities issued and guaranteed by the u.s. treasury and agencies. approximately 95% and 93% of our total investment securities portfolio was rated aa+ or its equivalent, or better, as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, while approximately 5% and 6% was below investment grade as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we categorize the credit ratings of our investment securities based on the lowest credit rating as issued by the following rating agencies: standard & poor's ratings services, moody's investors service ("moody's") and fitch ratings ("fitch").
table 11 provides information on the credit ratings of our non-agency rmbs, non-agency cmbs, other abs and other securities in our portfolio as of december 31, 2015 and 2014.

loans held for investment total loans held for investment ("hfi") consists of both unrestricted loans and loans restricted in our consolidated securitization trusts. table 12 summarizes our portfolio of loans held for investment by portfolio segment, net of the allowance for loan and lease losses, as of december 31, 2015 and 2014.

period-end loans held for investment increased by $21.5 billion to $229.9 billion as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014, primarily driven by continued growth in our credit card, auto and commercial loan portfolios, including loans acquired from the ge healthcare acquisition, partially offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.
we provide additional information on the composition of our loan portfolio and credit quality below in "credit risk profile," "md&a-consolidated results of operations" and "note 5-loans."
loans held for sale loans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value, increased by $278 million to $904 million as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily due to certain loan portfolios acquired as part of the ge healthcare acquisition that we intend to sell, as well as the transfer of certain domestic credit card loans from loans held for investment to loans held for sale.
deposits our deposits represent our largest source of funding for our operations, providing a consistent source of low-cost funds. total deposits increased by $12.2 billion to $217.7 billion as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014. the increase in deposits was primarily driven by the issuance of brokered deposits and growth in our consumer banking and commercial banking businesses as a result of our continued focus on deposit relationships with existing customers and our ongoing marketing strategy to attract new business from our commercial customers. we provide information on the composition of our deposits, average outstanding balances, interest expense and yield below in "liquidity risk profile."
65      capital one financial corporation (cof)
securitized debt obligations securitized debt obligations increased by $4.5 billion to $16.2 billion as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014 primarily driven by debt issuances of approximately $5.1 billion, offset by debt maturities of $500 million during 2015. we provide additional information on our borrowings below in "liquidity risk profile."
other debt other debt, which consists primarily of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes, and federal home loan banks ("fhlb") advances, totaled $42.9 billion as of december 31, 2015, of which $42.0 billion represented long-term debt and the remainder represented short-term borrowings. other debt totaled $36.8 billion as of december 31, 2014, of which $17.1 billion represented short-term borrowings and $19.7 billion represented long-term debt. during 2015, we extended the maturity of our fhlb advances which resulted in a decrease in our short-term borrowings and a corresponding increase in our long-term debt.
the increase in other debt of $6.1 billion in 2015 was primarily attributable to a net increase of $2.8 billion in fhlb advances, $3.2 billion in unsecured senior notes and $101 million in federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. we provide additional information on our borrowings below in "liquidity risk profile" and in "note 10-deposits and borrowings."
mortgage representation and warranty reserve we acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. these subsidiaries are capital one home loans, llc, which was acquired in february 2005; greenpoint, which was acquired in december 2006 as part of the north fork bancorporation, inc. ("north fork") acquisition; and ccb, which was acquired in february 2009 and subsequently merged into cona.
we have established representation and warranty reserves for losses associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable, including both litigation and non-litigation liabilities. these reserves are reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities. the reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires judgment. we evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis. we build our representation and warranty reserves through the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses, which we report in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non-interest income for loans originated and sold by ccb and capital one home loans, llc and as a component of discontinued operations for loans originated and sold by greenpoint. the aggregate reserve for all three entities totaled $610 million as of december 31, 2015, compared to $731 million as of december 31, 2014.
benefit for mortgage representation and warranty losses:
total benefit for mortgage representation and warranty losses             (80     )               (33     )
as part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental reserve under applicable accounting standards. our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond what was in our reserve as of december 31, 2015, is approximately $1.6 billion, a decline from our estimate of $2.1 billion as of december 31, 2014. the decrease in the reasonably possible estimate for representation and warranty claims was primarily driven by favorable industry legal developments.
66      capital one financial corporation (cof)
we provide additional information related to the representation and warranty reserve, including factors that may impact the adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by our subsidiaries, in "note 21-commitments, contingencies, guarantees and others."
deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management's judgment that realization is more likely than not. we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. these sources of income rely heavily on estimates. we use our historical experience and our short and long-range business forecasts to provide insight.
as of december 31, 2015, we have recorded deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowances, of approximately $3.7 billion, which is an increase of $330 million from december 31, 2014. we have recorded a valuation allowance of $166 million and $148 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we expect to fully realize the 2015 net deferred tax asset amounts in future periods. if changes in circumstances lead us to change our judgment about our ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years, we will adjust our valuation allowances in the period that our change in judgment occurs and record a corresponding increase or charge to income.
we provide additional information on income taxes in "consolidated results of operations" and in "note 18-income taxes."
off-balance sheet arrangements and variable interest entities in the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various types of arrangements with limited liability companies, partnerships or trusts that often involve special purpose entities and variable interest entities ("vies"). some of these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or may be recorded in amounts different from the full contract or notional amount of the arrangements, depending on the nature or structure of, and the accounting standards required to be applied to, the arrangement. these arrangements may expose us to potential losses in excess of the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. our involvement in these arrangements can take many forms, including securitization and servicing activities, the purchase or sale of mortgage-backed or other asset-backed securities in connection with our home loan portfolio and loans to vies that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets.
our continuing involvement in unconsolidated vies primarily consists of certain mortgage loan trusts and community reinvestment and development entities. we provide a discussion of our activities related to these vies in "note 7-variable interest entities and securitizations."
capital management the level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing and economic capital. the level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments.
capital standards and prompt corrective action we are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the federal banking agencies, including the final basel iii capital rule. moreover, the banks, as insured depository institutions, are subject to pca capital regulations.
in july 2013, the federal banking agencies finalized new capital rules that implemented the basel iii capital framework ("final basel iii capital rule") developed by the basel committee on banking supervision and certain dodd-frank act and other capital provisions, and that updated the pca capital framework to reflect the new regulatory capital minimums. the final basel iii capital rule amended both the basel i and basel ii advanced approaches frameworks, establishing a new common equity tier 1 capital
67      capital one financial corporation (cof)
requirement and setting higher minimum capital ratio requirements. we refer to the amended basel i framework as the "basel iii standardized approach," and the amended advanced approaches framework as the "basel iii advanced approaches."
at the end of 2012, we met one of the two independent eligibility criteria set by banking regulators for becoming subject to the advanced approaches capital rules. as a result, we have undertaken a multi-year process of implementing the advanced approaches regime for calculating risk-weighted assets and regulatory capital levels. we entered parallel run under advanced approaches on january 1, 2015, during which we will calculate capital ratios under both the basel iii standardized approach and the basel iii advanced approaches, though we will continue to use the standardized approach for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements.
in addition, beginning in the first quarter of 2015, as an advanced approaches banking organization, we are required to calculate and publicly disclose our supplementary leverage ratio.
for additional information about the capital adequacy guidelines we are subject to, see "part 1-item 1. business-supervision and regulation."
separately, we also disclose a non-gaap tce ratio in "part ii-item 6. summary of selected financial data." while the tce ratio is a capital measure widely used by investors, analysts, rating agencies, and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies, it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. we provide information on the calculation of this ratio in "md&a-table f-reconciliation of non-gaap measures and calculation of regulatory capital measures."
table 14 provides a comparison of our regulatory capital ratios under the basel iii standardized approach subject to transition provisions, the regulatory minimum capital adequacy ratios and the pca well-capitalized targets as of december 31, 2015 and 2014.

capital one financial corporation exceeded federal banking agencies' minimum capital requirements and each of the banks exceeded minimum regulatory requirements and were "well-capitalized" under pca requirements as of both december 31, 2015 and 2014. our common equity tier 1 capital ratio, as calculated under the basel iii standardized approach, subject to transition provisions, was 11.1% and 12.5% as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the calculation of our basel iii standardized approach common equity tier 1 capital under the final basel iii capital rule includes adjustments and deductions which are subject to transition provisions, such as the inclusion of the unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investment securities included in aoci and adjustments related to intangible assets other than goodwill. the inclusion of aoci and the adjustments related to intangible assets are phased-in at 20% for 2014, 40% for 2015, 60% for 2016, 80% for 2017 and 100% for 2018.
the following table compares our common equity tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as of december 31, 2015, calculated based on the final basel iii capital rule, subject to applicable transition provisions, to our estimated common equity tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as of december 31, 2015, calculated under the basel iii standardized approach, as it applies when fully phased-in for advanced approaches banks like us that have not yet exited parallel run. our estimated common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the fully phased-in basel iii standardized approach is based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and is subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. as we continue to engage with our regulators during our parallel run, there could be further changes to the calculation.

(3)   adjustments include higher risk weights for items that are included in capital based on the threshold deduction approach, such as mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets. the adjustments also include removal of risk weights for items that are deducted from common equity tier 1 capital.
(4)   calculated by dividing estimated common equity tier 1 capital by estimated risk-weighted assets, which are both calculated under the basel iii standardized approach, as it applies when fully phased-in for advanced approaches banks that have not yet exited parallel run.
under the final basel iii capital rule, when we complete our parallel run for the advanced approaches, our minimum risk-based capital requirement will be the greater of the basel iii standardized approach and the basel iii advanced approaches. see "part i-item 1. business-supervision and regulation" for additional information. once we exit parallel run, based on clarification of the final basel iii capital rule from our regulators, any difference between the final basel iii capital rule definitions of expected credit losses and our eligible credit reserves will be deducted from our basel iii standardized approach numerator, subject to transition provisions. inclusive of this impact, based on current rules and our business mix, we estimate that our basel iii advanced approaches ratios will be lower than our standardized approach ratios.

capital planning and regulatory stress testing in compliance with the applicable regulatory capital planning rules, on january 5, 2015 we submitted our capital plan to the federal reserve as part of the 2015 ccar cycle. on march 11, 2015, the federal reserve publicly disclosed its non-objection to our proposed capital distribution plans submitted pursuant to ccar. as a result of this non-objection to our capital plan, the board of directors authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common stock from the previous level of $0.30 per share to $0.40 per share. in addition, our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $3.125 billion of shares of our common stock beginning in the second quarter of 2015 through the end of the second quarter of 2016, in addition to share repurchases related to employee compensation. on february 17, 2016, we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $300 million of shares of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2016 under the 2015 stock repurchase program. for the description of the regulatory capital planning rules we are subject to, see "part i-item 1. business-supervision and regulation."
equity offerings and transactions on may 14, 2015, we issued and sold one million shares of fixed-to-floating rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series e, $0.01 par value, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (the "series e preferred stock"). the net proceeds of the offering of series e preferred stock were approximately $988 million, after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses. dividends are payable semi-annually in arrears in the second quarter and fourth quarter, at a rate of 5.55% per annum through may 31, 2020. subsequent to may 31, 2020, dividends will be calculated as three month libor plus a spread of 3.80%, payable quarterly in arrears.
on august 24, 2015, we issued and sold 20,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of 6.20% fixed rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series f, $0.01 par value, with a liquidation preference of $25 per depositary share (the "series f preferred stock"). the net proceeds of the offering of series f preferred stock were approximately $484 million, after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses. dividends on the series f preferred stock are payable quarterly in arrears.
dividend policy and stock purchases on february 3, 2016, our board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.40 per share, payable on february 26, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of the business on february 16, 2016. our board of directors also approved quarterly dividends on our 6.00% fixed-rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series b (the "series b preferred stock"), our 6.25% fixed-rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series c (the "series c preferred stock"), our 6.70% fixed-rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series d (the "series d preferred stock") and our series f preferred stock, payable on march 1, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on february 16, 2016. based on these declarations, we will pay approximately $211 million in common equity dividends and approximately $37 million in total preferred dividends in the first quarter of 2016. under the terms of our outstanding preferred stock, our ability to pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or to repurchase, redeem or acquire its common stock or any preferred stock ranking on parity with or junior to the preferred stock, is subject to restrictions in the event that we do not declare and either pay or set aside a sum sufficient for payment of dividends on the preferred stock for the immediately preceding dividend period.
the declaration and payment of dividends to our stockholders, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors. as a bhc, our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the banks to transfer funds to our bhc. as of december 31, 2015, funds available for dividend payments from cobna and cona were $2.9 billion and $359 million, respectively. there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders.
70      capital one financial corporation (cof)
in addition, consistent with our 2015 capital plan, our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $3.125 billion of shares of common stock beginning in the second quarter of 2015 through the end of the second quarter of 2016. on february 17, 2016, we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $300 million of shares of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2016 under the 2015 stock repurchase program. we notified the federal reserve of our intention to engage in additional share repurchases and the federal reserve did not object. through the end of 2015, we repurchased approximately $1.875 billion of common stock as part of the 2015 stock repurchase program.
the timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position and amount of retained earnings. our stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. for additional information on dividends and stock repurchases, see "part i-item 1. business-supervision and regulation-dividends, stock repurchases and transfer of funds."
risk management risk framework we use a risk framework to provide an overall enterprise-wide approach for effectively managing risk. we execute against our risk framework with the "three lines of defense" risk management model to demonstrate and structure the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk.
the "first line of defense" is comprised of the business areas that through their day-to-day business activities take risk on our behalf. as the business owner, the first line is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing and controlling that risk, and for mitigating our overall risk exposure. the first line formulates strategy and operates within the risk appetite and framework. the "second line of defense," which includes the risk management organization, provides oversight of first line risk taking and management. the second line assists in determining risk capacity, risk appetite, and the strategies, policies and structure for managing risks. the second line owns the risk framework. the second line is both an 'expert advisor' to the first line and an 'effective challenger' of first line risk activities. the "third line of defense" is comprised of our internal audit and credit review functions. the third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the board of directors that first and second line risk management and internal control systems and its governance processes are well-designed and working as intended.
establish governance processes, accountabilities, and risk appetites the starting point of our risk framework is the establishment of governance processes, accountabilities, and risk appetites. our board of directors and senior management establish the tone at the top regarding the importance of internal control, including standards of conduct and the integrity and ethical values of the company. management reinforces expectations at the various levels of the organization. this portion of the framework sets the foundation for the methods for governing risk taking, the interactions within and among the lines of defense, and the risk appetites and tolerances.
identify and assess risks and ownership identifying and assessing risks and ownership is the beginning of the more detailed day-to-day process of managing risk. this portion of the framework clarifies the importance of strong first-line management and accountability for identifying and assessing risk while specifying the role of the second line to identify and assess risk, particularly when taking on new initiatives.
develop and operate controls, monitoring and mitigation plans we develop, operate, and monitor controls to manage risk within tolerance levels. the first line develops controls to oversee and manage identified risks. controls may prevent risks from occurring (e.g., ensuring compliance with a law or regulation) or measure the amount of risk being taken so that the amount may be proactively managed. whenever possible, plans are implemented to mitigate risks or reduce them in order to reduce exposure. the first line leads mitigation, control, and monitoring actions. the second line is a consultant on control design when needed.
71      capital one financial corporation (cof)
test and detect control gaps and perform corrective action while the first line is principally accountable for taking, controlling, and monitoring risk, the second line oversees and monitors first line risk taking, including the effectiveness of first line controls, and the third line independently tests and oversees first and second line risk taking. these activities provide the second and third lines of defense with the ability to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized or unplanned risk taking within the organization. control gaps are closed by first line corrective action.
escalate key risks and gaps to executive management and when appropriate, the board of directors escalation is an important component of our risk framework. use of escalation is encouraged and does not necessarily indicate a failure on the part of first, second, or third line risk management. through escalation in the first line, decisions requiring judgment can be raised to executives who have the broadest possible context and experience to make challenging decisions. escalation in the second and third lines of defense can also demonstrate part of their core responsibilities of effective challenge. if appropriate, risks are escalated to the board of directors to ensure their alignment with material risk decisions and/or transparency to the largest risks facing the organization.
calculate and allocate capital in alignment with risk management and measurement processes (including stress testing)
capital is held to protect the company from unforeseen risks or unexpected risk severity. as such, it is important that capital planning processes be well linked with risk management practices to ensure the appropriate capital protections are in place for the safety and soundness of the company. stress testing and economic capital measurement, both of which incorporate inputs from across the risk spectrum, are key tools for evaluating our capital position and risk adjusted returns.
support with the right culture, talent, and skills the right culture, talent, and skills are critical to effective risk management. our risk framework is supported with the right culture that promotes the foundation and values of the risk management organization. skills necessary to effectively manage risk are reinforced through performance management systems. when needed, risk talent is augmented through recruitment of industry experts as well as training and development of internal associates.
enabled by the right data, infrastructure, and programs data, infrastructure, and programs are key enablers of our risk management processes and practices. these core requirements enable effective risk modeling, efficient first, second, and third line risk activity performance, and cross-line interaction. in addition, effective program design of each risk category is regularly assessed to ensure risk practices continue to evolve with leading industry practices, and continue to interact across categories as desired for a strong overall risk management program.
risk appetite risk appetite refers to the level of risk our business is willing to take in pursuit of our corporate business objectives. the board of directors approves our risk appetite including specific risk limits where applicable. while first line executives manage risk on a day-to-day basis, the chief risk officer provides effective challenge and independent oversight to ensure that risks are within the appetite and specific limits established by the board of directors. the chief risk officer reports to the board of directors regularly on the nature and level of risk across all eight risk categories. in addition to his broader management responsibilities, our chief executive officer is responsible for developing the strategy and mission of our organization, determining and leading our culture, and reviewing and providing input into our risk appetite.
we have a defined risk appetite for each of our eight risk categories that is approved by our board of directors. stated risk appetites define the parameters for taking and accepting risks and are used by management and our board of directors to make business decisions. we communicate risk appetite statements, limits and thresholds to the appropriate levels in the organization and monitor adherence.
risk categories we apply our risk framework to protect our company from the eight major categories of risk that we are exposed to through our business activities. our eight major categories of risk are:
72      capital one financial corporation (cof)
•   compliance risk: compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations. compliance risk can also arise from nonconformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, contractual obligations, or ethical standards that reinforce those laws, rules, or regulations;
•   credit risk: credit risk is the risk of loss from an obligor's failure to meet the terms of any contract or otherwise fail to perform as agreed;
•   legal risk: legal risk is the risk of material adverse impact due to: new and changed laws and regulations; interpretations of law; drafting, interpretation and enforceability of contracts; adverse decisions/consequences arising from litigation or regulatory scrutiny; the establishment, management and governance of our legal entity structure; and the failure to seek/follow appropriate legal counsel when needed;
•   liquidity risk: liquidity risk is the risk that the company will not be able to meet its future financial obligations as they come due, or invest in future asset growth because of an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time period;
•   market risk: market risk is the risk that an institution's earnings or the economic value of equity could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or other market factors;
•   operational risk: operational risk is the risk of loss, capital impairment, adverse customer experience, or reputational impact resulting from failure to comply with policies and procedures, failed internal processes or systems, or from external events;
•   reputation risk: reputation risk is the risk to market value, recruitment and retention of talented associates and maintenance of a loyal customer base due to the negative perceptions of our internal and external constituents regarding our business strategies and activities; and
•   strategic risk: strategic risk is the risk of a material impact on current or anticipated earnings, capital, franchise or enterprise value arising from: (i) the company's competitive and market position and evolving forces in the industry that can affect that position; (ii) lack of responsiveness to these conditions; (iii) strategic decisions to change the company's scale, market position or operating model; or (iv) failure to appropriately consider implementation risks inherent in the company's strategy.
compliance risk management we recognize that compliance requirements for financial institutions are increasingly complex and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers. in response, we continuously evaluate the regulatory environment and proactively adjust our compliance risk program to fully address these expectations.
our compliance management program establishes expectations for determining compliance requirements, assessing the risk of new product offerings, creating appropriate controls and training to address requirements, monitoring for control performance, and independently testing for adherence to compliance requirements. the program also establishes regular compliance reporting to senior business leaders, the executive committee and the board of directors.
the chief compliance officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our compliance risk management program. business areas incorporate compliance requirements and controls into their business policies, standards, processes and procedures. they regularly monitor and report on the efficacy of their compliance controls and corporate compliance periodically independently tests to validate the effectiveness of business controls.
credit risk management we recognize that we are exposed to cyclical changes in credit quality. consequently, we try to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns. our most important tool in this endeavor is sound underwriting. in unsecured consumer loan underwriting, we generally assume that loans will be subject to an environment in which losses are higher than those prevailing at the time of underwriting. in commercial underwriting, we generally require strong cash flow, collateral and covenants and guarantees. in addition to sound underwriting, we continually monitor our portfolio and take steps to collect or work out distressed loans.
73      capital one financial corporation (cof)
the chief risk officer, in conjunction with the consumer and commercial chief credit officers, is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures, including underwriting and hold guidelines and credit approval authority, and monitoring credit exposure and performance of our lending-related transactions. these responsibilities are fulfilled by the chief consumer credit officer and the chief commercial credit officer who are responsible for evaluating the risk implications of credit strategy and for oversight of credit for both the existing portfolio and any new credit investments. the chief consumer credit officer and the chief commercial credit officer have formal approval authority for various types and levels of credit decisions, including individual commercial loan transactions. division presidents within each segment are responsible for managing the credit risk within their divisions and maintaining processes to control credit risk and comply with credit policies and guidelines. in addition, the chief risk officer establishes policies, delegates approval authority and monitors performance for non-loan credit exposure entered into with financial counterparties or through the purchase of credit sensitive securities in our investment portfolio.
our credit policies establish standards in five areas: customer selection, underwriting, monitoring, remediation, and portfolio management. the standards in each area provide a framework comprising specific objectives and control processes. these standards are supported by detailed policies and procedures for each component of the credit process. starting with customer selection, our goal is to generally provide credit on terms that generate above hurdle returns. we use a number of quantitative and qualitative factors to manage credit risk, including setting credit risk limits and guidelines for each of our lines of business. we monitor performance relative to these guidelines and report results and any required mitigating actions to appropriate senior management committees and our board of directors.
legal risk management the general counsel provides legal evaluation and guidance to the enterprise and business areas and partners with other risk management functions such as compliance and internal audit. this evaluation and guidance is based on an assessment of the type and degree of legal risk associated with the internal business area practices and activities and of the controls the business has in place to mitigate legal risks.
liquidity risk management we seek to mitigate liquidity risk strategically and tactically. from a strategic perspective, we have acquired and built deposit gathering businesses and significantly reduced our loan to deposit ratio. from a tactical perspective, we have accumulated a sizable liquidity reserve comprised of cash, high-quality, unencumbered securities, and committed collateralized credit lines. we also continue to maintain access to the secured and unsecured markets through ongoing issuance. this combination of stable and diversified funding sources and our stockpile of liquidity reserves enables us to maintain confidence in our liquidity position.
the chief risk officer, in conjunction with the chief market and liquidity risk officer, is responsible for the establishment of liquidity risk management policies and standards for governance and monitoring of liquidity risk at a corporate level. the chief financial officer is accountable for the management of liquidity risk. we assess liquidity strength by evaluating several different balance sheet metrics under severe stress scenarios to ensure we can withstand significant funding degradation in both idiosyncratic, and market wide and combined liquidity stress scenarios. management reports liquidity metrics to appropriate senior management committees and our board of directors no less than quarterly. we continuously monitor market and economic conditions to evaluate emerging stress conditions with assessment and appropriate action plans in accordance with our contingency funding plan.
market risk management we recognize that interest rate and foreign exchange risk is inherent in the business of banking due to the nature of the assets and liabilities of banks. banks typically manage the trade-off between near-term earnings volatility and market value volatility by targeting moderate levels of each. in addition to using industry accepted techniques to analyze and measure interest rate and foreign exchange risk, we perform sensitivity analysis to identify our risk exposures under a broad range of scenarios. investment securities and derivatives are the main levers for the management of interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
the chief risk officer, in conjunction with the chief market and liquidity risk officer, is responsible for the establishment of market risk management policies and standards and for governance and monitoring of market risk at a corporate level. the chief financial officer is accountable for the management of market risk. we manage market risk exposure, which is principally driven by balance sheet interest rate risk, centrally and establish quantitative limits to control our exposure. market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our business operations and activities, including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives.
74      capital one financial corporation (cof)
the market risk positions of our banking entities and our total company are calculated separately and in total and are reported in comparison to pre-established limits to the asset liability committee monthly and to the risk committee of the board of directors no less than quarterly. management is authorized to utilize financial instruments as outlined in our policy to actively manage market risk exposure.
operational risk management we recognize the criticality of managing operational risk on a day-to-day basis and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers. we have implemented appropriate operational risk management policies, standards, processes and tools to enable the delivery of high quality and consistent customer experiences.
the chief operational risk officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our operational risk management program. the program establishes and enforces requirements and practices for assessing the operational risk profile, executing key control processes for select operational risks, and reporting of operational risk results. these activities are executed in accordance with basel ii advanced approaches requirements.
reputation risk management we recognize that reputation risk is of particular concern for financial institutions as a result of the aftermath of the financial crisis and economic downturn, which has resulted in increased scrutiny and widespread regulatory changes. we manage both strategic and tactical reputation issues and build our relationships with the government, media, consumer advocates, and other constituencies to help strengthen the reputations of both our company and industry. our actions include implementing pro-consumer practices in our business and taking public positions in support of better consumer practices in our industry. the general counsel is responsible for managing our overall reputation risk program. day-to-day activities are controlled by the frameworks set forth in our reputation risk management policy and other risk management policies.
strategic risk management we monitor external market and industry developments to identify potential areas of strategic opportunity or risk. these items provide input for development of the company's strategy led by the chief executive officer and other senior executives. through the ongoing development and vetting of the corporate strategy, the chief risk officer identifies and assesses risks associated with the strategy across all risk categories and monitors them throughout the year.
credit risk profile our loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure. our lending activities are governed under our credit policy and are subject to independent review and approval. below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics.
we also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to credit and counterparty settlement risk, including the purchase of securities for our investment securities portfolio, entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers, short-term advances on syndication activity, certain operational cash balances in other financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions, and customer overdrafts. we provide additional information on credit risk related to our investment securities portfolio under "consolidated balance sheets analysis-investment securities" and credit risk related to derivative transactions in "note 11-derivative instruments and hedging activities."
primary loan products we provide a variety of lending products. our primary loan products include credit cards, auto, home loans and commercial.
•   credit cards: we originate both prime and subprime credit cards through a variety of channels. our credit cards generally have variable interest rates. the majority of our credit card accounts are underwritten using an automated underwriting system based on predictive models that we have developed. the underwriting criteria, which are customized for individual products and marketing programs, are established based on an analysis of the net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to a further analysis using a variety of stress conditions. underwriting decisions are generally based on credit bureau information, including payment history, debt burden and credit scores, such as fair isaac corporation
75      capital one financial corporation (cof)
(credit rating) ("fico"), and on other factors, such as applicant income. we also maintain a credit card securitization program and selectively sell charged-off credit card loans.
•   auto: we originate both prime and subprime auto loans. customers are acquired through a network of auto dealers and direct marketing. our auto loans generally have fixed interest rates. loan terms are generally 75 months or less and can go up to 84 months. loan sizes are customized by program and are generally less than $75,000. the underwriting criteria are customized for individual products and marketing programs and based on analysis of net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to maintaining resilience under a variety of stress conditions. underwriting decisions are generally based on application information and credit bureau information, along with collateral characteristics such as loan-to-value ("ltv") ratio. we generally retain all of our auto loans, though we have securitized and sold auto loans in the past and may do so in the future.
•   home loans: most of the existing home loans in our loan portfolio were originated by banks we acquired. currently, we originate residential mortgage and home equity loans through our branches, direct marketing, and dedicated home loan officers. our home loan products include conforming and non-conforming fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans, as well as first and second lien home equity loans and lines of credit. in general, our underwriting policy limits for these loans include: (i) a maximum ltv ratio of 80% for loans without mortgage insurance; (ii) a maximum ltv ratio of 95% for loans with mortgage insurance or for home equity products; (iii) a maximum debt-to-income ratio of 50%; and (iv) a maximum loan amount of $3 million. our underwriting procedures are intended to verify the income of applicants and obtain appraisals to determine home values. we may, in limited instances, use automated valuation models to determine home values. our underwriting standards for conforming loans are designed to meet the underwriting standards required by the agencies at a minimum, and we sell most of our conforming loans to the agencies. we generally retain non-conforming mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit.
•   commercial: we offer a range of commercial lending products, including loans secured by commercial real estate and loans to middle market commercial and industrial companies. our commercial loans may have a fixed or variable interest rate; however, the majority of our commercial loans have variable rates. our underwriting standards require an analysis of the borrower's financial condition and prospects, as well as an assessment of the industry in which the borrower operates. where relevant, we evaluate and appraise underlying collateral and guarantees. we maintain underwriting guidelines and limits for major types of borrowers and loan products that specify, where applicable, guidelines for debt service coverage, leverage, ltv ratio and standard covenants and conditions. we assign a risk rating and establish a monitoring schedule for loans based on the risk profile of the borrower, industry segment, source of repayment, the underlying collateral and guarantees (if any) and current market conditions. although we generally retain commercial loans, we may syndicate positions for risk mitigation purposes (including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten). in addition, we originate and service multifamily commercial real estate loans which are sold to the gses.
loans held for investment portfolio composition our loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including restricted loans underlying our consolidated securitization trusts and loans held for sale. table 16 presents the composition of our portfolio of loans held for investment, including acquired loans, by portfolio segment, as of december 31, 2015 and 2014. table 16 and the credit metrics presented in this section exclude loans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value and totaled $904 million and $626 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

we market our credit card products throughout the united states, canada and the united kingdom. our credit card loan portfolio is geographically diversified due to our product and marketing approach, with higher concentrations in california, new york, texas, florida, illinois, pennsylvania and ohio.
our auto loan portfolio is originated in most regions of the united states with a concentration in texas, california, florida, georgia, louisiana, illinois and ohio. our home loan portfolio is concentrated in california, new york, maryland, illinois, virginia, new jersey and florida, which reflects the characteristics of the ing direct portfolio that comprises the majority of our home loans. retail banking includes small business loans and other consumer lending products originated through our branch network with a concentration in louisiana, new york, texas, new jersey, maryland and virginia.
our commercial banking loan portfolio is originated in most regions of the united states with a concentration in the tri-state area of new york, new jersey and connecticut, texas, california and louisiana. our small ticket commercial real estate portfolio, which was originated on a national basis through a broker network, is in a run-off mode.
we provide additional information on the geographic concentration, by loan category, of our loan portfolio in "note 5-loans."

(2)   in addition to loans outstanding, we also have unfunded lending commitments of approximately $3.4 billion to oil and gas companies as of december 31, 2015, which is included in our total unfunded lending commitments to extend credit disclosed in "note 5-loans."
acquired loans our portfolio of loans includes certain of our consumer and commercial loans acquired in business acquisitions that were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for using the guidance for accounting for purchased credit-impaired ("pci") loans and debt securities, which is based upon expected cash flows to be collected. these loans are referred to as "acquired loans" or "pci loans," totaling $19.5 billion as of december 31, 2015 compared to $23.5 billion as of december 31, 2014. see "md&a-glossary and acronyms" for the definition of "acquired loans."
the difference between the fair value at acquisition and expected cash flows represents the accretable yield, which is recognized in interest income over the life of the loans. the difference between the contractual payments on the loans and expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans. we regularly update our estimate of expected principal and interest to be collected from these loans and evaluate the results for each accounting pool that was established at acquisition based on loans with common risk characteristics. probable decreases in expected cash flows would trigger the recognition of an allowance for loan and lease losses through our provision for credit losses. probable and significant increases in expected cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses established subsequent to acquisition, with any remaining increase in expected cash flows recognized prospectively in interest income over the remaining estimated life of the underlying loans. see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for additional information on acquired loans that are accounted for based on expected cash flows.
home loans the majority of our home loan portfolio was acquired from the ing direct and ccb acquisitions. these acquired loans represented 73.4% and 77.4% of our total home loan portfolio as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. see "md&a-glossary and acronyms" for the definition of ing direct and ccb acquisitions. the expected cash flows for our acquired loans in our home loan portfolio are significantly impacted by future expectations of home prices and interest rates. decreases in expected cash flows that result from declining conditions, particularly associated with these variables, could result in an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses and reduction in accretable yield. charge-offs on these loans are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference are depleted. in addition, acquired loans are not classified as delinquent or nonperforming
78      capital one financial corporation (cof)
as we expect to collect our net investment in these loans and the nonaccretable difference is expected to absorb the majority of the losses associated with these loans.
table 18 presents our total home loan portfolio, and the break out of the acquired home loans and remaining loans within our home loan portfolio, by lien priority.

(1)   due to the revolving nature of credit card loans, we report the majority of our variable-rate credit card loans as due in one year or less. we report fixed-rate credit card loans with introductory rates that expire after a certain period of time as due in one year or less. we assume that the rest of our remaining fixed-rate credit card loans will mature within one to three years.
(2)   we report the maturity period for the home loans portfolio included in the consumer banking business based on the earlier of the next re-pricing or contractual maturity date of the loan.
credit risk measurement we closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. key metrics we track in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance commercial loans. trends in delinquency rates are a primary indicator of credit risk within our consumer loan portfolios, as changes in delinquency rates provide an early warning of changes in credit quality. the primary indicator of credit risk in our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings. because we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming, the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. in addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of our loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on regional economic conditions.
we underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which are typically based on credit bureau data, including borrower credit scores, along with application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. we continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. we also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions.
the following table provides details on the credit scores of our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios as of december 31, 2015 and 2014.

domestic credit card - refreshed fico scores:(1)
(1)   credit scores generally represent fico scores. these scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. we approximate non-fico credit scores to comparable fico scores for consistency purposes. balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category.
(2)   credit scores represent fico scores. these scores are obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. the fico score distribution is based on the average scores. balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category.
we present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio.
see "note 5-loans" in this report for additional credit quality information. also, see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for information on our accounting policies for delinquent and nonperforming loans, net charge-offs and tdrs for each of our loan categories.
delinquency rates we consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the customer's due date, measured at the reporting date. our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include loans that are 30 or more days past due but are currently classified as performing and accruing interest. the 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are the same for domestic credit card loans, as we continue to classify the substantial majority of domestic credit card loans as performing until the account is charged-off, typically when the account is 180 days past due. see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories. we provide additional information on our credit quality metrics above under "business segment financial performance."

troubled debt restructurings as part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide short-term (three to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral.
table 27 presents our recorded investment of loans modified in tdrs as of december 31, 2015 and 2014. it excludes loan modifications that do not meet the definition of a tdr and acquired loans accounted for based on expected cash flows, which we track and report separately.

the majority of our credit card tdrs involve reducing the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. the interest rate in effect immediately prior to the loan modification is used as the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment using the present value of expected cash flows. in some cases, the interest rate on a credit card account is automatically increased due to non-payment, late payment or similar events. in all cases, we cancel the customer's available line of credit on the credit card. if the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, likely resulting in any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency category, and charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy.
in the consumer banking business, the majority of our loans modified in tdrs receive an extension, an interest rate reduction or principal reduction, or a combination of both. in addition, tdrs also occur in connection with bankruptcy of the borrower. in certain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is written down to the collateral value and the charged off amount is reported as principal reduction. their impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows or a collateral evaluation for certain auto and home loans where the collateral value is lower than the recorded investment. in the commercial banking business, the majority of loans modified in tdrs receive an extension, with a portion of these loans receiving an interest rate reduction. the impairment on modified commercial loans is generally determined based on the underlying collateral value. we provide additional information on modified loans accounted for as tdrs, including the performance of those loans subsequent to modification, in "note 5-loans."
impaired loans a loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. generally, we report loans as impaired based on the method for measuring impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. loans defined as individually impaired include larger balance commercial nonperforming loans and tdrs. loans held for sale are not reported as impaired, as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value. impaired loans also exclude acquired loans accounted for based on expected cash flows because this accounting methodology takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred.
86      capital one financial corporation (cof)
impaired loans, including tdrs, totaled $2.5 billion and $1.9 billion as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. loans modified in tdrs accounted for $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion of impaired loans as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we provide additional information on our impaired loans, including the allowance for loan and lease losses established for these loans, in "note 5-loans" and "note 6-allowance for loan and lease losses."
allowance for loan and lease losses our allowance for loan and lease losses represents management's best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent in our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. the allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for credit losses and reduced by net charge-offs. we provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses in "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies."
our allowance for loan and lease losses increased by $747 million to $5.1 billion as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014. the allowance coverage ratio increased by 13 basis points to 2.23% as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014. the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by continued loan growth, coupled with our expectations of rising charge-off rates in our domestic credit card portfolio driven by growth, as well as adverse market conditions impacting our oil and gas portfolio and taxi medallion lending portfolio in our commercial banking business.

liquidity risk profile we have established liquidity practices that are intended to ensure that we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to withstand the potential impact of deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets. our practices are intended to maintain adequate liquidity reserves to cover our funding requirements as well as any potential deposit run-off and maintain access to diversified funding sources to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. our liquidity reserves consist of readily-marketable or pledgable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity, if needed.
table 30 below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of december 31, 2015 and 2014.

(1)   the weighted-average life of our securities was approximately 5.8 years and 5.7 years as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
(2)   as part of our liquidity management strategy, we pledge securities to secure borrowings from counterparties and to secure trust and public deposits and other purposes as required or permitted by law. we pledged securities available for sale with a fair value of $1.7 billion and $3.5 billion as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we also pledged securities held to maturity with a carrying value of $8.7 billion and $9.0 billion as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
our liquidity reserves increased by $366 million to $71.9 billion as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014. this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio, partially offset by an increase in our fhlb advances. see "md&a-risk management" for additional information on our management of liquidity risk.
we are subject to the final lcr rules as discussed in "part i-item 1. business-supervision and regulation." at december 31, 2015, we exceeded the fully phased-in lcr requirement. the calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations.

borrowing capacity we filed a new shelf registration statement with the sec on march 31, 2015, which expires in march 2018. under this shelf registration, we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. there is no limit under this shelf registration to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. we also filed a new shelf registration statement with the sec on july 30, 2015, which does not expire and allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $20 billion of securitized debt obligations.
in addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statements, we also have access to fhlb advances with a maximum borrowing capacity of $30.7 billion as of december 31, 2015, of which $10.2 billion was still available to us to borrow as of december 31, 2015. we pledged loan collateral with an outstanding balance of $36.9 billion to secure this borrowing capacity. the ability to draw down funding is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the banks' ability to post collateral. our fhlb membership is secured by our investment in fhlb stock of $884 million and $807 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which was determined in part based on our outstanding advances. we also have access to the federal reserve discount window through which we had a borrowing capacity of $13.2 billion as of december 31, 2015. on an annual basis, we process immaterial overnight test trades to ensure continued system functionality and borrowing capabilities. although available, we do not view this borrowing capacity as a primary source of liquidity and did not utilize it during 2015 or 2014.
funding the company's primary source of funding comes from deposits, which provide us with a stable and relatively low cost of funds. in addition to deposits, the company raises funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, fhlb advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios, the issuance of securitized debt obligations, the issuance of brokered deposits, the purchase of federal funds and other borrowings. a key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources.

the fdic limits the acceptance of brokered deposits by "well-capitalized" insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the fdic, by "adequately capitalized" institutions. cobna and cona were "well-capitalized," as defined under the federal banking regulatory guidelines, as of both december 31, 2015 and 2014. see "part i-item 1. business-supervision and regulation" for additional information.

table 32 presents the contractual maturities of large-denomination domestic time deposits of $100,000 or more as of december 31, 2015 and 2014. our funding and liquidity management activities factor into the expected maturities of these deposits. based on past activity, we expect to retain a portion of these deposits as they mature. accordingly, we expect the actual net cash outflows will be less than the contractual maturity amounts.

short-term borrowings and long-term debt we access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligation transactions, and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. in addition, we may utilize short-term and long-term fhlb advances secured by our investment securities, residential home loans, multifamily real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and home equity lines of credit. a portion of our long-term fhlbs are structured with a three-month call option at our discretion.
our short-term borrowings include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. the short-term borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and short-term fhlb advances, decreased by $16.1 billion to $981 million as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014 as we extended the maturity of our fhlb advances during 2015.
our long-term debt, which primarily consists of securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and long-term fhlb advances, increased by $26.8 billion to $58.1 billion as of december 31, 2015 from december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily attributable to net increases of $19.0 billion in long-term callable fhlb advances, $4.5 billion in securitized debt obligations and $3.2 billion in unsecured notes.

credit ratings our credit ratings impact our ability to access capital markets and our non-deposit borrowing costs. rating agencies base their ratings on numerous factors, including liquidity, capital adequacy, asset quality, quality of earnings and the probability of systemic support. significant changes in these factors could result in different ratings. such ratings help to support our cost effective unsecured funding as part of our overall financing programs. table 34 provides a summary of the credit ratings for the senior unsecured debt of capital one financial corporation, cobna and cona as of december 31, 2015 and 2014.

as of february 23, 2016, moody's, s&p and fitch have us on a stable outlook. on march 17, 2015, moody's announced that they would be adopting a new bank rating methodology that could potentially result in changes in the ratings of the securities of many banks, including capital one. as a result of this adoption, on may 14, 2015, capital one financial corporation's subordinated debt and preferred stock ratings received upgrades, while on june 19, 2015, cobna and cona's senior unsecured debt ratings received a downgrade of one level.
contractual obligations in the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments that affect our short- and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. our future cash outflows primarily relate to deposits, borrowings and operating leases. table 35 summarizes, by remaining contractual maturity, our significant contractual cash obligations based on the undiscounted future cash payments as of december 31, 2015. the actual timing and amounts of future cash payments may differ from the amounts presented below due to a number of factors, such as discretionary debt repurchases. table 35 excludes certain obligations where the obligation is short-term or subject to valuation based on market factors, such as trade payables and trading liabilities. the table also excludes the representation and warranty reserve of $610 million as of december 31, 2015 and obligations for pension and post-retirement benefit plans, which are discussed in more detail in "note 17-employee benefit plans."

market risk profile market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities, including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. below we provide additional information about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures we use to evaluate our market risk exposure.
interest rate risk interest rate risk, which represents exposure to instruments whose yield or price varies with the volatility of interest rates, is our most significant source of market risk exposure. banks are inevitably exposed to interest rate risk due to differences in the timing between the maturities or re-pricing of assets and liabilities.
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. our primary exposure is related to the funding of our non-dollar net investments in our international card business in the u.k. and canada. changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of non-dollar denominated equity invested in our foreign operations and impact our aoci and related capital ratios. our intercompany funding exposes our consolidated statements of income to foreign exchange transaction risk, while our equity investments in our foreign operations results in translation risk in aoci. we manage our transaction risk by entering into forward foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to foreign currency denominated intercompany borrowings. in the third quarter of 2014, we began entering into net investment hedges to manage our aoci exposure. we apply hedge accounting to both intercompany funding hedges and net investment hedges.
we measure our total exposure by regularly tracking the equity value of our net equity invested in our u.k. and canadian operations as well as their funding requirements. we apply a 30% u.s. dollar appreciation shock against each of our great british pound ("gbp") and canadian dollar ("cad") net investment exposures, which we believe approximates a significant adverse foreign exchange movement over a one-year time horizon. our gross equity exposures were 1.4 billion gbp and 1.3 billion gbp as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and 686 million cad and 581 million cad as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. as a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal.
market risk management we employ several techniques to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk, which include, but are not limited to, altering the duration and re-pricing characteristics of our various assets and liabilities through interest rate derivatives or mitigating the foreign exchange exposure of certain non-dollar denominated equity or transactions through derivatives. derivatives are one of the primary tools we use in managing interest rate and foreign exchange risk. our current market risk management policies include the use of derivatives. we execute our derivative contracts in both over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative markets. although the majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps, we also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage both our interest rate and foreign currency risk. the outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts totaled $105.9 billion as of december 31, 2015, compared to $88.6 billion as of december 31, 2014, driven by an increase in our hedging activities.

market risk measurement we have risk management policies and limits established by our market risk management policies and approved by the board of directors. our objective is to manage our asset and liability risk position and exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and prescribed limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analysis to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar denominated earnings and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. we provide additional information below in "economic value of equity."
we consider the impact on both net interest income and economic value of equity in measuring and managing our interest rate risk. because the federal funds rate was lowered to near zero in december 2008, remained in a target range of 0% to 0.25% until december 2015, and then increased to a range of 0.25% to 0.50%, we use a 50 basis points decrease as our declining interest rate scenario, since a scenario where interest rates would decline by 200 basis points is unlikely. in scenarios where a 50 basis points decline would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0%. below we discuss the assumptions used in calculating each of these measures.
net interest income sensitivity this sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month base-line interest rate sensitive revenue resulting from movements in interest rates. interest rate sensitive revenue consists of net interest income and certain components of other non-interest income significantly impacted by movements in interest rates, including changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and free-standing interest rate swaps. adjusted net interest income consists of net interest income and changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, including related derivative hedging activity, and changes in the fair value of free-standing interest rate swaps. in addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected interest rate sensitive revenue, we assume an instantaneous +200 basis points and -50 basis points shock, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above.
economic value of equity our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative hedging activity, resulting from movements in interest rates. our economic value of equity sensitivity measures are calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and do not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected plans for funding mix changes. in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points and -50 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above.
table 36 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected base-line net interest income and economic value of equity, calculated under the methodology described above, as of december 31, 2015 and 2014.
table 36: interest rate sensitivity analysis december 31,     december 31, 2014
estimated impact on economic value of equity
our projected net interest income and economic value of equity sensitivity measures were within our policy limits as of december 31, 2015 and 2014. in addition to these industry standard measures, we will continue to factor into our internal interest rate risk management decisions the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios.

limitations of market risk measures the interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. we regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities.
there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. the sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. the strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis.

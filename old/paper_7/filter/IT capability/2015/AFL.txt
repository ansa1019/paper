•   catastrophic events including, but not necessarily limited to, epidemics, pandemics, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, acts of terrorism and damage incidental to such events
•   ability to effectively manage key executive succession
•   level and outcome of litigation
•   increased expenses and reduced profitability resulting from changes in assumptions for pension and other postretirement benefit plans
md&a overview management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of aflac incorporated and its subsidiaries for the three-year period ended december 31, 2015. as a result, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements and notes. this md&a is divided into the following sections:
•   critical accounting estimates
•   analysis of financial condition, including discussion of market risks of financial instruments
•   capital resources and liquidity, including discussion of availability of capital and the sources and uses of cash our business aflac incorporated (the parent company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the company) primarily sell supplemental health and life insurance in the united states and japan. the company's insurance business is marketed and administered through american family life assurance company of columbus (aflac), which operates in the united states (aflac u.s.) and as a branch in japan (aflac japan). most of aflac's policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. aflac u.s. also markets and administers group products through continental american insurance company (caic), branded as aflac group insurance. our insurance operations in the united states and our branch in japan service the two markets for our insurance business.
reflecting the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate, total revenues decreased 8.2% to $20.9 billion in 2015, compared with $22.7 billion in 2014. net earnings in 2015 were $2.5 billion, or $5.85 per diluted share, compared with $3.0 billion, or $6.50 per diluted share, in 2014.
results for 2015 included pretax net realized investment gains of $140 million ($91 million after-tax), compared with net realized investment gains of $215 million ($140 million after-tax) in 2014. net investment gains in 2015 consisted of $303 million of net gains ($197 million after-tax) from the sale or redemption of securities; $153 million ($100 million after-tax) of other-than-temporary impairment losses; and $10 million of net losses ($7 million after-tax) from valuing derivatives.
shareholders' equity included a net unrealized gain on investment securities and derivatives of $3.0 billion at december 31, 2015, compared with a net unrealized gain of $4.7 billion at december 31, 2014.
in august 2015, we paid off $300 million of 3.45% fixed-rate senior notes upon their maturity. in august 2015, we paid off a 5.0 billion yen loan at its maturity date (a total of approximately $41 million using the exchange rate at the maturity date). in july 2015, we paid off a 10.0 billion yen loan at its maturity date (a total of approximately $81 million using the exchange rate at the maturity date). in march 2015, the parent company issued $1.0 billion of senior notes through a u.s. public debt offering. we entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps to economically convert the u.s. dollar denominated principal and interest on the senior notes we issued into yen-denominated obligations. in april 2015, the parent company used the proceeds from the march 2015 issuance of our fixed-rate senior notes to redeem all of its $850 million 8.50% fixed-rate senior notes due may 2019 and to pay a portion of the corresponding $230 million make-whole premium due to the investors of these notes.
in october 2015, the parent company and aflac jointly entered into a 364-day uncommitted bilateral line of credit that provides for borrowings in the amount of $100 million. in september 2015, the parent company and aflac amended a 50 billion yen revolving credit facility, resulting in jointly entering into an unsecured revolving credit facility agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that provides for borrowings in the amount of 55 billion yen. in february 2015, the parent company and aflac jointly entered into an uncommitted bilateral line of credit with a third party that provides for borrowings in the amount of $50 million. for further information regarding these transactions, see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the capital resources and liquidity section of this md&a.
we repurchased 21.2 million shares of our common stock in the open market for $1.3 billion under our share repurchase program in 2015, compared with 19.7 million shares repurchased in 2014.
critical accounting estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). these principles are established primarily by the financial accounting standards board (fasb). in this md&a, references to u.s. gaap issued by the fasb are derived from the fasb accounting standards codificationtm (asc). the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires us to make estimates based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. the estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of aflac's results of operations and financial condition are those related to the valuation of investments and derivatives, deferred policy acquisition costs (dac), liabilities for future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, and income taxes. the preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from management's analyses and judgments. the application of these critical accounting estimates determines the values at which 93% of our assets and 77% of our liabilities are reported as of december 31, 2015, and thus has a direct effect on net earnings and shareholders' equity. subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could produce significantly different results.
investments and derivatives aflac's investments, primarily consisting of debt, perpetual and equity securities, include both publicly issued and privately issued securities. for publicly issued securities, we determine the fair values from quoted market prices readily available from public exchange markets and price quotes and valuations from third party pricing vendors. for the majority of privately issued securities within our investment portfolio, a third party pricing vendor has developed valuation models to determine fair values. for the remaining privately issued securities, we use non-binding price quotes from outside brokers. we also routinely review our investments that have experienced declines in fair value to determine if the decline is other than temporary. the identification of distressed investments, the determination of fair value if not publicly traded and the assessment of whether a decline is other than temporary involve significant management judgment.
we must apply considerable judgment in determining the likelihood of the security recovering in value while we own it. factors that may influence this include our assessment of the issuer's ability to continue making timely payments of interest and principal, the overall level of interest rates and credit spreads, and other factors. this process requires consideration of risks which can be controlled to a certain extent, such as credit risk, and risks which cannot be controlled, such as interest rate risk. management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects impairment losses in the company's net earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on the nature of the loss, as such evaluations are revised.
our derivative activities include foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps in vies that are consolidated; foreign currency swaps associated with certain senior notes and our subordinated debentures; foreign currency forwards and options used in hedging foreign exchange risk and options on interest rate swaps (or interest rate swaptions) used in hedging interest rate risk on u.s. dollar-denominated securities in aflac japan's portfolio; and foreign currency forwards and options used to economically hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in yen. inputs used to value derivatives include, but are not limited to, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign currency forward and spot rates, and interest volatility. with the exception of the derivatives associated with our vie investments, the fair values of the derivatives referenced above are based on the amounts we would expect to receive or pay to terminate the derivatives. for derivatives associated with vies where we are the primary beneficiary, we receive valuations from a third party pricing vendor.
see notes 1, 3, 4 and 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
deferred policy acquisition costs and policy liabilities aflac's products are generally long-duration fixed-benefit indemnity contracts. we make estimates of certain factors that affect the profitability of our business to match expected policy benefits and deferrable acquisition costs with expected policy premiums. these factors include persistency, morbidity, mortality, investment yields and expenses. if actual results match the assumptions used in establishing policy liabilities and the deferral and amortization of acquisition costs, profits are expected to emerge ratably over the life of the policy. however, because actual results will vary from the assumptions, profits as a percentage of earned premiums will vary from year to year.
we measure the adequacy of our policy reserves and recoverability of dac annually by performing gross premium valuations on our business. our testing indicates that our insurance liabilities are adequate and that our dac is recoverable.
deferred policy acquisition costs certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and amortized over the policy's premium payment period in proportion to anticipated premium income. future amortization of dac is based upon our estimates of persistency, interest and future premium revenue generally established at the time of policy issuance. however, the unamortized balance of dac reflects actual persistency. see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detail of the dac activity for the past two years.
policy liabilities the following table provides details of policy liabilities by segment and in total as of december 31.

other policy liabilities                   14,142                14,657
total consolidated policy liabilities     $87,631       (1)     $83,933
(1) the sum of the japan and u.s. segments exceeds the total due to reinsurance and retrocession activity.
our policy liabilities, which are determined in accordance with applicable guidelines as defined under u.s. gaap and actuarial standards of practice, include two components that involve analysis and judgment: future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, which accounted for 80% and 4% of total policy liabilities as of december 31, 2015, respectively.
future policy benefits provide for claims that will occur in the future and are generally calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be incurred less the present value of future expected net benefit premiums. we calculate future policy benefits based on assumptions of morbidity, mortality, persistency and interest. these assumptions are generally established at the time a policy is issued. the assumptions used in the calculations are closely related to those used in developing the gross premiums for a policy. as required by u.s. gaap, we also include a provision for adverse deviation, which is intended to accommodate adverse fluctuations in actual experience.
unpaid policy claims include those claims that have been incurred and are in the process of payment as well as an estimate of those claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported to us. we compute unpaid policy claims on a non-discounted basis using statistical analyses of historical claims payments, adjusted for current trends and changed conditions. we update the assumptions underlying the estimate of unpaid policy claims regularly and incorporate our historical experience as well as other data that provides information regarding our outstanding liability.
our insurance products provide fixed-benefit amounts per occurrence that are not subject to medical-cost inflation. furthermore, our business is widely dispersed in both the united states and japan. this geographic dispersion and the nature of our benefit structure mitigate the risk of a significant unexpected increase in claims payments due to epidemics and events of a catastrophic nature. claims incurred under aflac's policies are generally reported and paid in a relatively short time frame. the unpaid claims liability is sensitive to morbidity assumptions, in particular, severity and frequency of claims. severity is the ultimate size of a claim, and frequency is the number of claims incurred. our claims experience is primarily related to the demographics of our policyholders.
as a part of our established financial reporting and accounting practices and controls, we perform detailed annual actuarial reviews of our policyholder liabilities (gross premium valuation analysis) and reflect the results of those reviews in our results of operations and financial condition as required by u.s. gaap. for aflac japan, our annual review in 2015 indicated that we needed to strengthen the liability associated with a block of care policies, primarily due to low investment yields. we strengthened our future policy benefits liability by $18 million in 2015 as a result of this review. our review in 2014 and 2013 indicated no need to strengthen liabilities associated with policies in japan. for aflac u.s., our annual reviews in 2015 and 2014 indicated no need to strengthen liabilities associated with policies in the united states. our review in 2013 indicated that we needed to strengthen the liability associated primarily with long-term care in the united states. we strengthened our future policy benefits liability by $20 million in 2013 as a result of this review.
the table below reflects the growth of the future policy benefits liability for the years ended december 31.
future policy benefits
the growth of the future policy benefits liability in yen for aflac japan and in dollars for aflac u.s. has been due to the aging of our in-force block of business and the addition of new business.
in computing the estimate of unpaid policy claims, we consider many factors, including the benefits and amounts available under the policy; the volume and demographics of the policies exposed to claims; and internal business practices, such as incurred date assignment and current claim administrative practices. we monitor these conditions closely and make adjustments to the liability as actual experience emerges. claim levels are generally stable from period to period; however, fluctuations in claim levels may occur. in calculating the unpaid policy claim liability, we do not calculate a range of estimates. the following table shows the expected sensitivity of the unpaid policy claims liability as of december 31, 2015, to changes in severity and frequency of claims.
sensitivity of unpaid policy claims liability
(in millions)                                                                                                total severity total frequency   decrease               decrease               unchanged                       increase               increase by 2%                  by 1%                                                     by 1%                  by 2%
other policy liabilities, which accounted for 16% of total policy liabilities as of december 31, 2015, consisted primarily of discounted advance premiums on deposit from policyholders in conjunction with their purchase of certain aflac japan insurance products. these advanced premiums are deferred upon collection and recognized as premium revenue over the contractual premium payment period. advanced premiums represented 43% and 47% of the december 31, 2015 and 2014 other policy liabilities balances, respectively. see the aflac japan segment subsection of this md&a for further information.
income taxes income tax provisions are generally based on pretax earnings reported for financial statement purposes, which differ from those amounts used in preparing our income tax returns. deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with u.s. gaap is a two-step process. under the first step, the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. the second step is measurement, whereby a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that an amount will not be realized. the determination of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions.
in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our management considers all available evidence, including taxable income in open carry back years, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, forecasted earnings, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, future taxable temporary difference reversals, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. in the event we determine it is not more likely than not that we will be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. likewise, if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. future economic conditions and market volatility, including increases in interest rates or widening credit spreads, can adversely impact the company's tax planning strategies and in particular the company's ability to utilize tax benefits on previously recognized capital losses. our judgments and assumptions are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future performance and specific industry and investment market conditions.
interest rates and credit spreads in both the united states and japan are not the only factors that impact the company's unrealized gain/loss position and the evaluation of a need for a valuation allowance on the company's deferred tax asset, but they do have a direct and significant effect on both. based on our methodology described above for evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we have determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future, therefore we have not recorded a valuation allowance as of december 31, 2015.
see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
new accounting pronouncements during the last three years, various accounting standard-setting bodies have been active in soliciting comments and issuing statements, interpretations and exposure drafts. for information on new accounting pronouncements and the impact, if any, on our financial position or results of operations, see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
results of operations the following discussion includes references to our performance measures, operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share, that are not based on u.s. gaap. operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. consistent with u.s. gaap accounting guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is our measure of segment performance. aflac believes that an analysis of operating earnings is vitally important to an understanding of our underlying profitability drivers and trends of our insurance business. furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is conducted in japan, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact of translating japanese yen into u.s. dollars.
aflac defines operating earnings (a non-u.s. gaap financial measure) as the profits derived from operations. operating earnings includes interest cash flows associated with notes payable but excludes items that cannot be predicted or that are outside of management's control, such as realized investment gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities; nonrecurring items; and other non-operating income (loss) from net earnings. aflac's derivative activities are primarily used to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risk in our investment portfolio as well as manage foreign exchange risk for certain notes payable and forecasted cash flows denominated in yen. our management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities, as well as other and nonrecurring items, tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events or related to infrequent activities not directly associated with the company's insurance operations, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in aflac's insurance operations.
the following table is a reconciliation of items impacting operating and net earnings and operating and net earnings per diluted share for the years ended december 31.
items impacting net earnings, net of tax:
securities transactions and impairments               97                   119                    41                 .23       .26               .09
impact of derivative and hedging activities:
investments other derivative and hedging activities               27       (1)          16       (1)         229       (1)   .06           .03               .49
(2) includes a loss of $13, after tax, in 2015 related to the change in value of yen repatriation received in advance of settlement of certain foreign currency derivatives. this loss was offset by derivative gains included in other derivative and hedging activities.
realized investment gains and losses our investment strategy is to invest in fixed-maturity securities to provide a reliable stream of investment income, which is one of the drivers of the company's growth and profitability. this investment strategy incorporates asset-liability matching (alm) to align the expected cash flows of the portfolio to the needs of the company's liability structure. we do not purchase securities with the intent of generating capital gains or losses. however, investment gains and losses may be realized as a result of changes in the financial markets and the creditworthiness of specific issuers, tax planning strategies, and/or general portfolio management and rebalancing. the realization of investment gains and losses is independent of the underwriting and administration of our insurance products, which are the principal drivers of our profitability.
securities transactions and impairments during 2015, we realized pretax investment gains, net of losses, of $303 million ($197 million after-tax) from sales and redemptions of securities. these net gains primarily resulted from sales of japanese government bonds (jgbs) as part of a portfolio repositioning exercise. we realized pretax investment losses of $153 million ($100 million after-tax) as a result of the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment losses on certain securities. investment losses were primarily related to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment loss on a single holding.
during 2014, we realized pretax investment gains, net of losses, of $215 million ($140 million after-tax) from sales and redemptions of securities. these net gains primarily resulted from gains on sales of jgbs and our u.s. treasury holdings, currency gains from transactions by our externally managed portfolio of u.s. dollar-denominated bank loans, and assorted other bond sales and calls. we realized pretax investment losses of $31 million ($20 million after-tax) as a result of the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment losses on certain securities.
during 2013, we realized pretax investment gains, net of losses, of $262 million ($170 million after-tax) from sales and redemptions of securities. these net gains primarily resulted from sales of jgbs as part of a portfolio repositioning exercise. we also realized modest gains from bond tender offers of several of our holdings. we realized pretax investment losses of $199 million ($129 million after-tax) as a result of the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment losses on certain securities.
see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more details on these investment activities.

(1) includes $131 and $45 for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2013, respectively, for credit-related impairments; $26 for the year ended december 31, 2013 for impairments due to severity and duration of decline in fair value; and $22, $31 and $128 for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, from change in intent to sell securities impact of derivative and hedging activities our derivative activities include foreign currency swaps and credit default swaps held in consolidated vies; foreign currency forwards and options, interest rate swaptions and futures on certain fixed-maturity securities; foreign currency forwards and options that economically hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in yen; and foreign currency swaps associated with certain senior notes and our subordinated debentures. during 2015, we realized pretax investment losses, net of gains, of $10 million ($7 million after-tax), compared with pretax investment gains, net of losses, of $31 million ($20 million after-tax) in 2014 and pretax investment gains, net of losses, of $336 million ($218 million after-tax) in 2013 as a result of valuing these derivatives, net of the effects of hedge accounting. for a description of other items that could be included in the impact of derivative and hedging activities, see the hedging activities subsection of md&a and note 4 of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.
for additional information regarding realized investment gains and losses, see notes 3 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
other and non-recurring items during the second quarter of 2015, the make-whole premium paid to the investors of our 8.50% fixed-rate senior notes for the early redemption of those notes was recorded as a $230 million pretax non-operating loss ($150 million after-tax, or $.35 per diluted share). the company also includes the accounting impacts of remeasurement associated with changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate as an other non-operating item.
foreign currency translation aflac japan's premiums and most of its investment income are received in yen. claims and expenses are paid in yen, and we have yen-denominated assets that support yen-denominated policy liabilities. these and other yen-denominated financial statement items are translated into dollars for financial reporting purposes. we translate aflac japan's yen-denominated income statement into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate its yen-denominated balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period.
income taxes our combined u.s. and japanese effective income tax rate on pretax earnings was 34.4% in 2015, 34.3% in 2014 and 34.4% in 2013. total income taxes were $1.3 billion in 2015, compared with $1.5 billion in 2014 and $1.7 billion in 2013. japanese income taxes on aflac japan's results account for most of our consolidated income tax expense. see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
earnings guidance our original objective for 2015 was to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 2% to 7% over 2014, and we revised the objective during the year to a 4% to 7% increase, excluding the effect of foreign currency translation. in april 2015, we executed a make-whole transaction to enhance our consolidated capital position (see the capital resources and liquidity section of this md&a for further discussion). as a result of this transaction, we incurred a non-operating charge of $.35 to operating earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015. however, operating earnings per diluted share benefited by approximately $.07 for the full year 2015 due to a net reduction in interest expense. we reported 2015 net earnings per diluted share of $5.85. adjusting that number for after-tax realized investment gains ($.09 per diluted share), other non-operating expense ($.40 per diluted share), and foreign currency translation (an expense of $.46 per diluted share), we finished the year above the top of the target range with a 7.5% increase in operating earnings per diluted share.
stronger than expected earnings growth from 2015 will create tough comparisons in 2016. our objective for 2016 is to produce stable operating earnings per diluted share of $6.17 to $6.41, assuming the average exchange rate in 2015 of 120.99 yen to the dollar. with volatile financial markets and interest rates at significantly depressed levels, it is difficult to safely invest cash flows at attractive yields. additionally, 2016 benefit ratios in both the u.s. and japan anticipate continued favorable experience. if we achieve our objective for 2016, the following table shows the likely results for operating earnings per diluted share, including the impact of foreign currency translation using various yen/dollar exchange rate scenarios.
(1)excludes realized investment gains/losses (securities transactions, impairments, and the impact of derivative and hedging activities), nonrecurring items, and other non-operating income (loss) in 2016 and 2015
insurance operations aflac's insurance business consists of two segments: aflac japan and aflac u.s. aflac japan, which operates as a branch of aflac, is the principal contributor to consolidated earnings. u.s. gaap financial reporting requires that a company report financial and descriptive information about operating segments in its annual and interim period financial statements. furthermore, we are required to report a measure of segment profit or loss, certain revenue and expense items, and segment assets.
we evaluate our sales efforts using new annualized premium sales, an industry operating measure. new annualized premium sales, which include both new sales and the incremental increase in premiums due to conversions, represent the premiums that we would collect over a 12-month period, assuming the policies remain in force. for aflac japan, new annualized premium sales are determined by applications submitted during the reporting period. for aflac u.s., new annualized premium sales are determined by applications that are issued during the reporting period. premium income, or earned premiums, is a financial performance measure that reflects collected or due premiums that have been earned ratably on policies in force during the reporting period.
aflac japan segment aflac japan pretax operating earnings changes in aflac japan's pretax operating earnings and profit margins are primarily affected by morbidity, mortality, expenses, persistency and investment yields. the following table presents a summary of operating results for aflac japan for the years ended december 31.

the relatively small change in premium income in yen for 2015 and 2014 was influenced by the impact of weak first sector sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013 in addition to premiums ceded in reinsurance transactions during those same years. annualized premiums in force at december 31, 2015, were 1.62 trillion yen, compared with 1.59 trillion yen in 2014 and
1.57 trillion yen in 2013. the increases in annualized premiums in force in yen of 1.5% in 2015, 1.7% in 2014 and 5.0% in 2013 reflect the sales of new policies combined with the high persistency of aflac japan's business. annualized premiums in force, translated into dollars at respective year-end exchange rates, were $13.4 billion in 2015, $13.2 billion in 2014, and $14.9 billion in 2013.
aflac japan's investment portfolios include dollar-denominated securities and reverse-dual currency securities (yen-denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments). u.s. dollar-denominated investment income from these assets accounted for approximately 50% of aflac japan's investment income in 2015, compared with 46% in 2014 and 44% in 2013. in years when the yen strengthens in relation to the dollar, translating aflac japan's u.s. dollar-denominated investment income into yen lowers growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. in years when the yen weakens, translating u.s. dollar-denominated investment income into yen magnifies growth rates for net investment income, total operating revenues, and pretax operating earnings in yen terms. excluding foreign currency changes from the respective prior year, u.s. dollar-denominated investment income accounted for approximately 46% of aflac japan's investment income during 2015, compared with 44% in 2014 and 39% in 2013.
the following table illustrates the effect of translating aflac japan's u.s. dollar-denominated investment income and related items into yen by comparing certain segment results with those that would have been reported had yen/dollar exchange rates remained unchanged from the prior year.

in 2015, the benefit ratio decreased compared with 2014, resulting from the impact of reinsurance; changes in foreign currency; and favorable claims experience. the three reinsurance agreements that we entered into since the end of the third quarter of 2013 reduced the benefit ratio by approximately 99 basis points for 2015. the benefit ratio has also been influenced by the effect of low investment yields, which impacts our profit margin by reducing the spread between investment yields and required interest on policy reserves (see table and discussion in the interest rate risk subsection of this md&a). in 2015, the operating expense ratio remained relatively stable, compared with 2014. in total, the pretax operating profit margin improved in 2015, compared with 2014. for 2016, we anticipate the pretax operating profit margin to be comparable with the 2015 and 2014 levels.
the foundation of aflac japan's product portfolio has been, and continues to be, our third sector cancer and medical products. sales of third sector products increased 13.4% in 2015, compared with the same period in 2014, exceeding the high end of our revised sales target range of 10% to 13%. we have been focusing more on promotion of our cancer and medical products in this low-interest-rate environment. these products are less interest-rate sensitive and more profitable compared to first sector products.
sales of cancer insurance continued to be strong following the introduction at the end of the third quarter of 2014 of new cancer days, which includes an exclusive policy sold through japan post. cancer insurance sales were up 40.6% in 2015, compared with 2014. aflac japan enhanced its medical product with new riders in june 2015. this revision provides better protection against critical diseases such as cancer, heart attack and stroke. with continued cost pressure on japan's health care system, we expect the need for third sector products will continue to rise in the future, and we remain convinced that the medical and cancer products aflac japan provides will continue to be an important part of our product portfolio.
aflac japan's first sector product sales, which include ways and child endowment, were down 7.3% in 2015, compared with 2014. we expect that for 2016, the sale of first sector products will continue to be down in comparison to 2015, as our focus remains on less interest-sensitive third sector products.
we remain committed to selling through our traditional channels. these channels, consisting of affiliated corporate agencies, independent corporate agencies and individual agencies, accounted for 85.1% of total new annualized premium sales for aflac japan in 2015. in 2015, we recruited over 300 new sales agencies. at december 31, 2015, aflac japan was represented by more than 13,100 sales agencies and approximately 114,000 licensed sales associates employed by those agencies.
at december 31, 2015, we had agreements to sell our products at 372 banks, approximately 90% of the total number of banks in japan. bank channel sales accounted for 14.9% of new annualized premium sales in 2015 for aflac japan, compared with 21.5% in 2014.
aflac japan and japan post holdings entered into a new agreement in july 2013, further expanding a partnership that was established in 2008 (see japanese regulatory environment). at the end of june 2014, japan post insurance(kampo) received financial services agency (fsa) regulatory approval to enter into an agency contract with aflac japan to begin distributing aflac japan's cancer insurance products at all of kampo's 79 directly managed sales offices. aflac japan has developed a unique aflac-branded cancer product for japan post and kampo that was introduced on october
1, 2014. in the fourth quarter of 2014, the number of postal outlets selling our cancer products expanded to approximately 10,000, and starting july 1, 2015, japan post expanded the number of post offices that offer aflac's cancer products to more than 20,000 postal outlets. we believe this alliance with japan post will further benefit our cancer insurance sales.
we believe that there is still a continued need for our products in japan. our sales target and focus in 2016 will continue to be centered around the sale of aflac japan's third sector products, including cancer and medical. although our traditional channels remain key to our success, we have developed partnerships with new channels to help increase our overall sales growth. these channels include japan post, and we are making steady progress with our sales through postal outlets. in 2016, we believe that third sector sales will be down mid-single digits in comparison to 2015. we believe that the long-term compound annual growth rate will be in the range of 4% to 6%.
japanese regulatory environment in 2005, legislation aimed at privatizing japan's postal system (japan post) was enacted into law. the privatization laws split japan post into four operating entities that began operations in october 2007. in 2007, one of these entities selected aflac japan as its provider of cancer insurance to be sold through its post offices, and, in 2008, we began selling cancer insurance through these post offices. japan post has historically been a popular place for consumers to purchase insurance products. legislation to reform the postal system passed the diet in april 2012 and resulted in the merger of two of the postal operating entities (the one that delivers the mail and the one that runs the post offices) on october 1, 2012. in july 2013, aflac japan entered into a new agreement with japan post holdings to further expand a partnership that was established in 2008 (see aflac japan sales).
in june 2013, a revision to the financial instruments and exchange act established a post-funded orderly resolution regime for financial institutions to prevent a financial crisis in the event of a financial institution's failure. this regime came into effect in march 2014, but is not expected to have a material impact on the company's operations in japan.
aflac japan invests in u.s. dollar-denominated securities, including publicly-traded investment grade and below investment grade corporate fixed-maturity securities, and has entered into foreign currency forwards and options to hedge the currency risk on the fair value of the u.s. dollar securities. in 2015, as part of our normal portfolio management and asset allocation process, aflac japan increased the allocation of investments to a u.s. dollar senior secured bank loan program by approximately $950 million and to a u.s. dollar high yield corporate bond program by approximately $650 million, all of which had been funded as of december 31, 2015.
during the third and fourth quarters of 2015, we increased our investment in yen-denominated publicly traded equity securities, including new investments in exchange traded funds (etfs) holding japan real estate investment trusts. these securities are classified as available for sale and carried on our balance sheet at fair value. as of december 31, 2015, the fair value of our investment in yen-denominated publicly traded equity securities was $485 million.
see the analysis of financial condition section of this md&a for further discussion of these investment programs.
funds available for investment include cash flows from operations, investment income, and funds generated from maturities, redemptions, securities lending, and other securities transactions. securities lending is also used from time to time to accelerate the availability of funds for investment. purchases of securities from period to period are determined based on multiple objectives including appropriate portfolio diversification, the relative value of a potential investment and availability of investment opportunities, liquidity, credit and other risk factors while adhering to our investment policy guidelines. aflac japan purchased debt security investments at an aggregate acquisition cost of approximately 663.6 billion yen in 2015 (approximately $5.5 billion), 1.0 trillion yen in 2014 (approximately $10.0 billion) and 2.5 trillion yen in 2013 (approximately $25.4 billion).
the following table presents the composition of debt security purchases by sector and equity security purchases for aflac japan, as a percentage of acquisition cost, for the years ended december 31.

we use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments. furthermore, we use several methods to monitor these criteria, including credit rating services and internal credit analysis. the ratings referenced in the two tables below are based on the ratings designations provided by the major credit rating agencies (moody's investors service (moody's), standard & poor's ratings services (s&p), and fitch ratings (fitch)) or, if not rated, are determined based on our internal credit analysis of such securities. for investment-grade securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, we use the second lowest rating that is assigned. for a description of the ratings methodology that we use when a security is below investment grade or split-rated (one rating agency rates the security as investment grade while another rating agency rates the same security as below investment grade), see "market risks of financial instruments - below-investment-grade and split-rated securities" in the analysis of financial condition section of this md&a.
the distributions by credit rating of aflac japan's purchases of debt securities for the years ended december 31, based on acquisition cost, were as follows:
composition of purchases by credit rating
the relatively higher aaa rated purchases in 2014 resulted from our decision to allocate part of our u.s. dollar securities allocation to u.s. treasuries, in addition to our purchases of investment-grade corporate bonds. we sold these u.s. treasuries later in 2014. the relatively higher purchases of aa rated securities in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to the purchase of jgbs. the increase in purchases of a rated securities in 2015 was due primarily to the purchase of jbgs, which had been downgraded from aa to a in the fourth quarter of 2014. the increase in purchases of bbb rated securities in 2015 was due primarily to the purchase of u.s. dollar-denominated corporate securities. the significant increase in purchases of bb or lower rated securities during 2015 was due to increased investment in senior secured bank loans, most of which have below-investment-grade ratings, and investment in high yield corporate bonds. for more information on these investments, see the credit risk subsection of this md&a.

our highest sector concentration is in government and agencies. see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the market risks of financial instruments - credit risk subsection of md&a for more information regarding the sector concentrations of our investments.
yen-denominated debt and perpetual securities accounted for 72.8% of aflac japan's total debt and perpetual securities at december 31, 2015, compared with 75.7% at december 31, 2014, at amortized cost.
the distributions of debt and perpetual securities owned by aflac japan, by credit rating, as of december 31 were as follows:

aflac u.s. segment aflac u.s. pretax operating earnings changes in aflac u.s. pretax operating earnings and profit margins are primarily affected by morbidity, mortality, expenses, persistency and investment yields. the following table presents a summary of operating results for aflac u.s. for the years ended december 31.

the benefit ratio decreased in 2015, compared with 2014, due to mix of business changes and continued favorable claims experience. the expense ratio increased in 2015, compared with 2014, primarily due to increased spending
associated with changes in the aflac u.s. sales structure. in total, the pretax operating profit margin remained stable in 2015, compared with 2014. in 2016, we expect the benefit and expense ratios to be relatively stable compared with 2015.

(1) includes cancer, critical illness and hospital intensive care products new annualized premium sales for accident insurance, our leading product category, increased 10.2%, short-term disability sales increased 7.6%, critical care insurance sales (including cancer insurance) increased 6.0%, and hospital indemnity insurance sales decreased 7.5% in 2015, compared with 2014.
in 2015, our traditional u.s. sales forces included more than 9,200 u.s. associates who were actively producing business on a weekly basis. we believe that the average weekly producing sales associates metric allows our sales management to actively monitor progress and needs on a real-time basis. beyond expanding the size and capabilities of our traditional sales force, we remain encouraged about establishing and developing relationships with insurance brokers that typically handle the larger-case market.
the addition of group products has expanded our reach and enabled us to generate more sales opportunities with larger employers, brokers, and our traditional sales agents. we anticipate that the appeal of our group products will continue to enhance our opportunities to connect with larger businesses and their employees. our portfolio of group and individual products offers businesses the opportunity to give their employees a more valuable and comprehensive selection of benefit options.
we believe that changes we made to our career and broker management infrastructure over the last 18 months are laying the foundation for expanded long-term growth opportunities. during 2014, aflac u.s. implemented tactical initiatives centered around providing competitive compensation to our career agent sales hierarchy and positioning us to more effectively and consistently execute on the u.s. sales strategy across all states. these measures are designed to more effectively link sales management's success to aflac's success. for example, we enhanced compensation through an incentive bonus for the first level of our sales management, district sales coordinators, who are primarily responsible for selling aflac products and training new sales associates. additionally, we eliminated the commission-based position of state sales coordinator. to better manage our state operations, we introduced the new position of market director, effective october 1, 2014. market directors are salaried with the opportunity to earn sales-related bonuses. we believe these changes have enhanced and will continue to enhance performance management and better align compensation with new business results.
one day paysm is a claims initiative that we have focused on at aflac u.s. to process, approve and pay eligible claims in just one day. we believe that along with our brand and relevant products, this claims practice will help aflac stand out from competitors.
with the evolving business market and the coverage standardization that will result from health care reform in the united states, we believe aflac's voluntary products will become more relevant than ever. our products provide cash benefits that can be used to help with increasing out-of-pocket medical expenses, help cover household costs, or protect against income and asset loss. our group products and relationships with insurance brokers that handle the larger-case market are helping us as we expand our reach selling to larger businesses. we are regularly evaluating the marketplace to identify opportunities to bring the most relevant, cost-effective products to our customers. we believe the need for our products remains very strong, and we continue to work on enhancing our distribution capabilities to access employers of all sizes, including initiatives that benefit our field force and the broker community. at the same time, we are seeking opportunities to leverage our brand strength and attractive product portfolio in the evolving health care environment. for 2016, our objective is for aflac u.s. new annualized premium sales to increase 3% to 5%, with a long-term compound annual growth rate at or above the voluntary market growth rate of 5%.
u.s. regulatory environment the affordable care act (aca) is intended to give americans of all ages and income levels access to comprehensive major medical health insurance. the major elements of the bill became effective on january 1, 2014. the primary subject of the legislation is major medical insurance; as enacted, the aca does not materially affect the design of our insurance products. however, indirect consequences of the legislation and regulations, including uncertainty related to implementation, could present challenges and/or opportunities that could potentially have an impact on our sales model, financial condition and results of operations. our experience with japan's national health care environment leads us to believe that the need for supplemental insurance will only increase over the coming years.
on december 18, 2015, the president signed into law the consolidated appropriations act which included a revision to delay implementation of the excise tax on high cost plans, better known as the "cadillac tax." this tax was originally scheduled to begin in 2017, was previously delayed until 2018, and is now scheduled to begin in 2020. the tax consists of 40% of the cost of employer sponsored health coverage in excess of certain dollar thresholds. in general, only aflac specified disease and fixed indemnity (i.e. supplemental health) products offered on a pre-tax basis are taken into account under this tax.
the legislation also makes the tax deductible by the payer. if employers fund coverage on a pre-tax basis, aflac, as the insurer, would be liable for its pro-rata share of any tax on excess coverage, determined based on the cost of aflac coverage compared to the total cost of the applicable health coverage in which each employee is enrolled. making the tax deductible would then reduce the economic impact of any tax that is imposed and payable by aflac.
many employers are concerned about the tax and what impact it will have on benefit offerings in the future. there is confusion in the market about how the tax is calculated and who pays the tax, presenting a risk that some employers will mistakenly conclude that all supplemental health products are included in the calculation for the tax regardless of pre-tax funding status or whether an employer's health coverage exceeds the trigger for the tax. some employers may decide simply to drop coverage of affected supplemental health products, rather than convert it to an after-tax basis. during this extended implementation period, aflac will be assessing the impact of this tax; educating employers about the tax; and investigating ways to mitigate the impact of the tax. having employees pay for the coverage on an after-tax basis would exempt affected supplemental health products from the tax.
the dodd-frank act, which was signed into law in 2010, created, among other things, a financial stability oversight council (the council). in april 2012, the council released a final rule describing the general process it will follow in determining whether to designate a nonbank financial company for supervision by the board of governors of the u.s. federal reserve system (the board). the council may designate by a two-thirds vote whether certain nonbank financial companies, including certain insurance companies and insurance holding companies, could pose a threat to the financial stability of the united states, in which case such nonbank financial companies would become subject to prudential regulation by the board. on april 3, 2013, the board published a final rule that establishes the requirements for determining when a nonbank financial company is "predominantly engaged in financial activities" - a prerequisite for designation by the council. prudential regulation by the board includes supervision of capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements and examinations. the board may limit such company's ability to enter into mergers, acquisitions and other business combination transactions, restrict its ability to offer financial products, require it to terminate one or more activities, or impose conditions on the manner in which it conducts activities. the council
designated two insurers in 2013 and an additional insurer in 2014 as a systemically important financial institution (sifi). on december 18, 2014, the president signed the insurance capital standards clarification act into law. this legislation will clarify the board's authority to apply insurance-based capital standards for insurance companies subject to federal supervision. although aflac is a nonbank financial company predominantly engaged in financial activities as defined in the dodd-frank act, we do not believe aflac will be considered a company that poses a threat to the financial stability of the united states.
title vii of the dodd-frank act and regulations issued thereunder may have an impact on aflac's derivative activity, including activity on behalf of aflac japan, in particular rules to require central clearing and collateral for certain types of derivatives. in 2014, the five u.s. banking regulators and the u.s. commodity futures trading commission (cftc) re-proposed for comment their rules regarding collateral for uncleared swaps. final rules were issued by the five u.s. banking regulators on october 22, 2015 and by the cftc on december 16, 2015. such rules may result in increased collateral requirements or affect other aspects of aflac's derivatives activity.
the dodd-frank act also established a fio under the u.s. treasury department to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and of lines of business other than certain health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance. traditionally, u.s. insurance companies have been regulated primarily by state insurance departments. in december 2013, the fio released a report entitled "how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the united states." the report was required by the dodd-frank act, and included 18 recommended areas of near-term reform for the states, including addressing capital adequacy and safety/soundness issues, reform of insurer resolution practices, and reform of marketplace regulation. the report also listed nine recommended areas for direct federal involvement in insurance regulation. some of the recommendations outlined in the fio report released in december 2013 have been implemented. of the nine recommended areas for direct federal involvement in insurance regulation that are applicable to aflac, the president signed the national association of registered agents and brokers reform act into law in january 2015, which simplifies the agent and broker licensing process across state lines. the fio has also engaged with the supervisory colleges to monitor financial stability and identify regulatory gaps for large national and internationally active insurers.
the process of implementing the dodd-frank act is ongoing and continues to involve additional rulemaking from time to time. at the current time, it is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty what impact, if any, the dodd-frank act will have on our u.s. business, financial condition, or results of operations.
under state insurance guaranty association laws and similar laws in international jurisdictions, we are subject to assessments, based on the share of business we write in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. in the united states, some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. the company's policy is to accrue assessments when the entity for which the insolvency relates has met its state of domicile's statutory definition of insolvency, the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable and the related premium upon which the assessment is based is written. in most states, the definition is met with a declaration of financial insolvency by a court of competent jurisdiction.
penn treaty network company and its subsidiary american network insurance company (collectively referred to as penn treaty) were placed in rehabilitation on january 6, 2009, and remained in rehabilitation as of december 31, 2015. as of december 31, 2015, we were unable to estimate when or to what extent penn treaty will ultimately be declared insolvent, or the amount of the insolvency. as such, we have not established any accruals for guaranty fund assessments associated with penn treaty as of december 31, 2015.
aflac u.s. investments the level of investment income is affected by available cash flow from operations, the timing of investing the cash flow, yields on new investments, and other factors. aflac u.s. has invested primarily in investment grade corporate bonds. in 2015, as part of our normal portfolio management and asset allocation process, aflac u.s. purchased $120 million of high yield corporate bonds and $118 million of middle market loan receivables, of which $53 million was unfunded. as of december 31, 2015, we had commitments of $182 million to fund potential future loan originations related to the middle market loan investment program. these commitments are contingent upon the availability of middle market loans that meet our underwriting criteria. during the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated a commercial mortgage loan investment program. as of december 31, 2015, we had $10 million in outstanding commitments to fund commercial mortgage loans, which had not yet been funded. these commitments are contingent on the final underwriting and due diligence to be performed, and may or may not be funded. see notes 1 and 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding loans and loans receivables. we are planning to invest in additional asset classes such as
securitized assets and alternative asset classes, all of which we believe will improve diversification and enhance long-term returns in 2016 and thereafter.
funds available for investment include cash flows from operations, investment income, and funds generated from maturities, redemptions, and other securities transactions. purchases of securities from period to period are determined based on multiple objectives, including appropriate portfolio diversification, the relative value of a potential investment and availability of investment opportunities, liquidity, credit and other risk factors while adhering to our investment policy guidelines. aflac u.s. purchased debt security investments at an aggregate acquisition cost of approximately $900 million in 2015, compared with $1.0 billion in 2014 and $1.2 billion in 2013. the following table presents the composition of debt security purchases by sector and other investment purchases for aflac u.s., as a percentage of acquisition cost, for the years ended december 31.

we use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments. furthermore, we use several methods to monitor these criteria, including credit rating services and internal credit analysis. the ratings referenced in the two tables below are based on the ratings designations provided by the major credit rating agencies (moody's, s&p, and fitch) or, if not rated, are determined based on our internal credit analysis of such securities. for investment-grade securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, we use the second lowest rating that is assigned. for a description of the ratings methodology that we use when a security is below investment grade or split-rated (one rating agency rates the security as investment grade while another rating agency rates the same security as below investment grade), see "market risks of financial instruments - below-investment-grade and split-rated securities" in the analysis of financial condition section of this md&a.
the distributions by credit rating of aflac's u.s. purchases of debt securities for the years ended december 31, based on acquisition cost, were as follows:
composition of purchases by credit rating
the increase in purchases of bbb rated securities in 2015 was due primarily to the purchase of u.s. dollar-denominated corporate fixed-income publicly traded securities. the increase in purchases of bb or lower rated securities during 2015 was due to investment in high yield corporate bonds.
the increase in the aflac u.s. new money yield in 2015 was primarily due to wider credit spreads achieved in portfolio investing activities.

the overall credit quality of aflac u.s. investments remained high. at the end of 2015, 95.3% of aflac u.s. debt and perpetual securities were rated investment grade, on an amortized cost basis. see notes 3 and 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the analysis of financial condition section of this md&a for additional information on our investments.
other operations corporate operating expenses consist primarily of personnel compensation, benefits, reinsurance retrocession activities, and facilities expenses. corporate expenses, excluding investment and retrocession income, were $90 million in 2015, $91 million in 2014 and $79 million in 2013. investment income included in reported corporate expenses was $22 million in 2015, $13 million in 2014 and $11 million in 2013, and net retrocession income was $7 million in 2015.
analysis of financial condition our financial condition has remained strong in the functional currencies of our operations. the yen/dollar exchange rate at the end of each period is used to translate yen-denominated balance sheet items to u.s. dollars for reporting purposes.
the following table demonstrates the effect of the change in the yen/dollar exchange rate by comparing select balance sheet items as reported at december 31, 2015, with the amounts that would have been reported had the exchange rate remained unchanged from december 31, 2014.

(1)excludes available-for-sale fixed-maturity securities held by the parent company and other business segments of $523 in 2015 and
because we invest primarily in fixed-maturity securities, our financial instruments are exposed primarily to three types of market risks: currency risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk. in 2015, we increased our investment allocation to yen-denominated equity securities, thereby increasing our exposure to equity risk.
currency risk the functional currency of aflac japan's insurance operations is the japanese yen. all of aflac japan's premiums, claims and commissions are received or paid in yen, as are most of its other expenses. most of aflac japan's cash and liabilities are yen-denominated. aflac japan's investments consisted of yen-denominated fixed income securities of $60.8
billion, at amortized cost, and yen-denominated equity securities of $472 million, at cost, at december 31, 2015. however, aflac japan also owns u.s. dollar-denominated fixed income securities of $14.9 billion, at amortized cost, whose fair value is hedged against currency risk as well as $7.8 billion of fixed income securities, at cost, that are not hedged. aflac japan owns u.s. dollar-denominated equity securities of $4 million, at cost, as of december 31, 2015. yen-denominated investment income accounted for 50% of aflac japan's investment income in 2015, with the remainder denominated in u.s. dollars. in addition, aflac incorporated has yen-denominated debt obligations.
we are exposed to currency risk as an economic event only when yen funds are actually converted into dollars. this occurs when we repatriate yen-denominated funds from aflac japan to aflac u.s. the exchange rates prevailing at the time of repatriation will differ from the exchange rates prevailing at the time the yen profits were earned. a portion of the yen repatriation may be used to service aflac incorporated's yen-denominated notes payable with the remainder converted into dollars. in order to economically hedge foreign exchange risk for a portion of the profit repatriation received in yen from aflac japan, we had foreign exchange forwards and options as part of a hedging strategy on 30.0 billion yen, 102.5 billion yen, 25.0 billion yen, and 85.0 billion yen received in february 2015, july 2015, september 2015, and december 2015, respectively. as of december 31, 2015, we had foreign exchange forwards and options to economically hedge foreign exchange risk on 124.1 billion yen of future profit repatriation from aflac japan.
in addition to profit repatriation, certain investment activities for aflac japan expose us to economic currency risk when yen are converted into dollars. as noted above, we invest a portion of our yen cash flows in u.s. dollar-denominated assets. this requires that we convert the yen cash flows to u.s. dollars before investing. as previously discussed, for certain of our u.s. dollar-denominated securities, we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the currency risk on the fair value of the securities. the dollar coupon payments received on these investments are not hedged and are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations, which are realized in earnings. also, aflac japan has invested in reverse-dual currency securities (rdcs, or yen-denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments), which exposes aflac to changes in foreign exchange rates. the foreign currency effect on the yen-denominated securities is accounted for as a component of unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities in accumulated other comprehensive income, while the foreign currency effect on the dollar coupons is realized in earnings. the rdcs provided a higher yield at the time of purchase than those available on japanese government or other public corporate bonds, while still adhering to our investment standards at the time of the transaction. the yen/dollar exchange rate would have to strengthen to approximately 29 before the yield on these instruments would equal that of a comparable jgb instrument.
aside from the activities discussed above, we generally do not convert yen into dollars; however, we do translate financial statement amounts from yen into dollars for financial reporting purposes. therefore, reported amounts are affected by foreign currency fluctuations. we report unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income. in periods when the yen weakens against the dollar, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. when the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported. the weakening of the yen relative to the dollar will generally adversely affect the value of our yen-denominated investments in dollar terms. we attempt to minimize the exposure of shareholders' equity to foreign currency. we accomplish this by investing a portion of aflac japan's investment portfolio in u.s. dollar-denominated securities and by the parent company's issuance of yen-denominated debt (for additional information, see the discussion under the hedging activities subsection of md&a). as a result, the effect of currency fluctuations on our net assets is reduced.
the following table demonstrates the effect of foreign currency fluctuations by presenting the dollar values of our yen-denominated assets and liabilities, and our consolidated yen-denominated net asset exposure at selected exchange rates as of december 31.

for additional information regarding our aflac japan net investment hedge, see the hedging activities subsection of md&a.
interest rate risk our primary interest rate exposure is to the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in debt and perpetual securities. we monitor our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis utilizing a full valuation methodology, measuring price volatility, and sensitivity of the fair values of our investments to interest rate changes on the debt and perpetual securities we own. for example, if the current duration of a debt security or perpetual security is 10, then the fair value of that security will increase by approximately 10% if market interest rates decrease by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant. likewise, the fair value of the debt security or perpetual security will decrease by approximately 10% if market interest rates increase by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain constant.
the estimated effect of potential increases in interest rates on the fair values of debt and perpetual securities we own; derivatives, excluding credit default swaps, and notes payable as of december 31 follows:

(1)excludes capitalized lease obligations there are various factors that affect the fair value of our investment in debt and perpetual securities. included in those factors are changes in the prevailing interest rate environment, which directly affect the balance of unrealized gains or losses for a given period in relation to a prior period. decreases in market yields generally improve the fair value of debt and perpetual securities, while increases in market yields generally have a negative impact on the fair value of our debt and perpetual securities. however, we do not expect to realize a majority of any unrealized gains or losses because we generally have the intent and ability to hold such securities until a recovery of value, which may be maturity. for additional information on unrealized losses on debt and perpetual securities, see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
we attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. the following table presents the approximate duration of aflac japan's yen-denominated assets and liabilities, along with premiums, as of december 31.

(1)represents investments for aflac japan that support policy obligations and therefore excludes aflac japan's annuity products we continue to monitor the spread between our new money yield and the required interest assumption for newly issued products in both the united states and japan and will re-evaluate those assumptions as necessary. over the next two years, we have yen-denominated securities that will mature with yields in excess of aflac japan's current net investment yield of 2.82%. these securities total $723 million at amortized cost and have a weighted average yield of 4.23%. currently, when debt and perpetual securities we own mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. however, adding riders to our older policies has helped offset negative investment spreads on these policies. overall, adequate profit margins exist in aflac japan's aggregate block of business because of changes in the mix of business and favorable experience from mortality, morbidity and expenses.
periodically, depending on general economic conditions, we may enter into derivative transactions to hedge interest rate risk.
credit risk a significant portion of our investment portfolio consists of debt securities or perpetual securities that expose us to the credit risk of the underlying issuer. we carefully evaluate this risk on every new investment and closely monitor the credit risk of our existing investment portfolio. we incorporate the needs of our products and liabilities, the overall requirements of the business, and other factors in addition to our underwriting of the credit risk for each investment in the portfolio.
evaluating the underlying risks in our credit portfolio involves a multitude of factors including but not limited to our assessment of the issuers business activities, assets, products, market position, financial condition, and future prospects. we also must incorporate the assessment of the nrsros in assigning credit ratings to our specific portfolio holdings. we perform extensive internal assessments of the credit risks for all our portfolio holdings and potential new investments.
the ratings of our securities referenced in the two tables below are based on the ratings designations provided by major nrsros (moody's, s&p and fitch) or, if not rated, are determined based on our internal analysis of such securities. for investment-grade securities where the ratings assigned by the major credit agencies are not equivalent, we use the second lowest rating that is assigned. for a description of the ratings methodology that we use when a security is below
investment grade or split-rated, see "market risks of financial instruments - below-investment-grade and split-rated securities" in the analysis of financial condition section of this md&a.
the distributions by credit rating of our purchases of debt securities for the years ended december 31, based on acquisition cost, were as follows:
composition of purchases by credit rating
purchases of securities from period to period are determined based on multiple objectives including appropriate portfolio diversification, the relative value of a potential investment and availability of investment opportunities, liquidity, credit and other risk factors while adhering to our investment policy guidelines. we did not purchase any perpetual securities during the periods presented in the table above. total purchases comprise new money investments as well as the reinvestment of proceeds from investment disposals. the relatively higher purchases of aa rated securities in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to the purchase of jgbs. the increase in purchases of a rated and bbb rated securities in 2015 was due primarily to the purchase of u.s. dollar-denominated corporate fixed-income publicly traded securities for the aflac japan portfolio. the significant increase in purchases of bb or lower rated securities in 2015 was due to increased investment in senior secured bank loans, most of which have below-investment-grade ratings, and investment in high yield corporate bonds. the bank loan investment program is managed externally by third party firms specializing in this asset class. this mandate requires a minimum average credit quality of bb-/ba3, prohibits loan purchases rated below b/b2, and restricts exposure to any individual credit to less than 2% of the program's assets. the objectives of this program include enhancing the yield on invested assets, achieving further diversification of credit risk, and mitigating the risk of rising interest rates through the acquisition of floating rate assets. the objective of the high yield corporate bond investments is to enhance yield on invested assets and further diversify our credit risk. all investments must have a minimum rating of low bb using our above described rating methodology and are managed by our internal credit portfolio management team.
the distributions of debt and perpetual securities we own, by credit rating, as of december 31 were as follows:

as of december 31, 2015, our direct and indirect exposure to securities in our investment portfolio that were guaranteed by third parties was immaterial both individually and in the aggregate.
subordination distribution the majority of our total investments in debt and perpetual securities was senior debt at december 31, 2015 and 2014. we also maintained investments in subordinated financial instruments that primarily consisted of lower tier ii, upper tier ii, and tier i securities, listed in order of seniority. the lower tier ii securities are debt instruments with fixed maturities. our upper tier ii and tier i investments consisted of debt instruments with fixed maturities and perpetual securities, which have an economic maturity as opposed to a stated maturity.

investment concentrations one of our largest sector concentrations as of december 31, 2015, was banks and financial institutions. approximately 11% and 14% of our total portfolio of debt and perpetual securities, on an amortized cost basis, was in the bank and financial institution sector at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. within the countries we approve for investment opportunities, we primarily invest in financial institutions that are strategically crucial to each approved country's economy. the bank and financial institution sector is a highly regulated industry and plays a strategic role in the global economy. within this sector, our credit risk by geographic region or country of issuer at december 31, 2015, based on amortized cost, was: europe, excluding the united kingdom (28%); united states (26%); australia (8%); japan (8%); united kingdom (9%); and other (21%).

(1)jgbs or jgb-backed securities as previously disclosed, we own long-dated debt instruments in support of our long-dated policyholder obligations. some of our largest global investment holdings are positions that were purchased many years ago and increased in size due to merger and consolidation activity among the issuing entities. in addition, many of our largest holdings are yen-denominated, therefore strengthening of the yen can increase our position in dollars, and weakening of the yen can decrease our position in dollars. our global investment guidelines establish concentration limits for our investment portfolios.

european sovereign debt crisis since 2008, many countries in europe, and specifically greece, ireland, italy, portugal, and spain (collectively the "peripheral eurozone" countries), have experienced a debt crisis. collective action by multiple parties including the european central bank (ecb), international monetary fund (imf), european council, and individual member states' governments had largely improved market perception of the situation across europe. in exchange for this support, affected countries generally agreed to implement a series of measures to improve their fiscal situation in exchange for loans and other aid. most countries continue to implement the prescribed austerity measures and have seen improvement in their economies, which in turn has seen their creditworthiness improve or stabilize.
the resolve to maintain the european monetary union (emu) was tested in 2015 following the election of a new government in greece, who rejected the requirements imposed in exchange for their previous support packages. after a period of tense negotiations which threatened greece's ability to remain in the emu, agreements were made which provided greece additional aid in exchange for an updated set of requirements. these actions have stabilized the situation currently.
although recent economic indicators show improvement from the depths of the crisis across most of the eurozone, overall economic activity remains subdued throughout the region. to support the return to sustainable economic growth, the ecb has launched a quantitative easing (qe) stimulus program.
the primary factor considered when determining the domicile of investment exposure is the legal country risk location of the issuer. however, other factors such as the location of the parent guarantor, the location of the company's headquarters or major business operations (including location of major assets), location of primary market (including location of revenue generation) and specific country risk publicly recognized by rating agencies can influence the assignment of the country (or geographic) risk location. when the issuer is a special financing vehicle or a branch or subsidiary of a global company, then we consider any guarantees and/or legal, regulatory and corporate relationships of the issuer relative to its ultimate parent in determining the proper assignment of country risk.
investments in certain european countries - monitoring and mitigating exposure our internal team of experienced credit professionals has continued to monitor the impact of the european sovereign crisis on our individual investment holdings' overall credit quality. our analysis includes factors beyond a baseline assessment of a company's assets, operations, financial statements, and credit metrics that may provide support for the instruments we own. specifically, for our investments in european banks and financial institutions, we monitor the importance of the issuer to its local financial system, the likelihood of government support, and our investment's position in the capital structure of the issuer. for our investments in european utilities, we monitor the role of the issuer in its local economy as a provider of necessary infrastructure, and we monitor the value of the underlying assets owned by the issuer. for our investment in european corporates, industrials, and other commercial entities, we monitor the general credit quality of the issuer, the geographical mix of the issuer's customers (i.e. domestic vs. foreign), the geographical breakdown of the issuer's assets (i.e. domestic versus foreign), the value of the underlying assets owned by the issuer, capitalization of the issuer, and overall profitability and cash generation ability of the issuer. we monitor nrsro actions and the likely actions for our investment exposures, as well as overall market conditions. by performing these analyses, we make a determination on the probability of timely payment of principal and interest of the issuers of our investments.
some of our peripheral eurozone fixed-maturity investments contain covenants that we believe mitigate our risk to the issuer. these covenants could include put options that allow us to return our holdings to the issuer at a predetermined price, usually par, should the issuer be downgraded to below investment grade by a rating agency. additionally, these covenants may include restrictions on the ability of the issuer to incur additional debt, sell assets, or provide collateral for indebtedness. as of december 31, 2015, all of the issuers of our holdings from peripheral eurozone countries were current on their obligations to us, and we believe they have the ability to meet their obligations to us.
as of december 31, 2015, our investments in peripheral eurozone countries totaled $2.8 billion, or 2.9% of our total debt and perpetual securities, at amortized cost. we have no direct exposure to greece. apart from our direct investments in peripheral eurozone sovereign debt totaling $262 million, our other exposures as of december 31, 2015 to the european sovereign debt crisis were investments in peripheral eurozone banks and financial institutions of $488 million, peripheral eurozone non-banks (excluding sovereigns) of $2.0 billion, core eurozone1 banks and financial institutions of $1.7 billion, core eurozone non-banks (excluding sovereigns) of $4.2 billion, core eurozone sovereigns of $486 million, and non-eurozone2 holdings throughout the balance of europe of $5.0 billion, all at amortized cost. other investment risks stemming from the european sovereign debt crisis that are not possible to measure and include the impact of slower economic activity throughout europe and its impact on global economic growth and market disruption including illiquidity and impaired valuations due to heightened concerns and lack of investor confidence.
although the situation had largely stabilized across europe, the crisis in greece that re-emerged in mid-2015 demonstrates certain risks remain as the area continues working to improve its economic footing.  we continue to monitor the situation closely including the heightened interrelationship between political, monetary, fiscal, and economic forces; the pace of underlying structural reforms; the possibility of continued contagion to additional sovereigns and other entities; further stress on the banking systems throughout the region; and the impact on the underlying economic fundamentals throughout the eurozone.
2non-eurozone europe includes the united kingdom, switzerland, sweden, norway, denmark, czech republic and poland.
oil and gas exposure as a result of the large decline in oil prices, there has been heightened attention to certain investments in the various energy sub-sectors related to oil and gas following a large increase in market volatility. our portfolio includes holdings diversified across multiple sub-sectors of the oil and gas industry, spread among multiple geographies. the following table shows the breakout of our exposure to the oil and gas industry as of december 31.

and held to maturity as of december 31, 2015, the weighted-average rating of our total fixed maturity oil and gas exposure is bbb, and 93% of this exposure is investment grade. absent a major change in the outlook for oil prices, we expect the increase in market volatility surrounding these issuers to continue. this could lead to increased negative ratings activity from the public rating agencies for energy-related credit issuers. we do not currently expect our investments in these sub-sectors related to oil and gas to have a material impact on our results of operations.
securities by type of issuance we have investments in both publicly and privately issued securities. our ability to sell either type of security is a function of overall market liquidity which is impacted by, among other things, the amount of outstanding securities of a particular issuer or issuance, trading history of the issue or issuer, overall market conditions, and idiosyncratic events affecting the specific issue or issuer.

(1)principal payments in yen and interest payments in dollars aflac japan has invested in privately issued securities to better match liability characteristics and secure higher yields than those available on japanese government or other public corporate bonds. all of the yen-denominated privately issued securities we have purchased were rated investment grade at the time of purchase. aflac japan's investments in yen-denominated privately issued securities consist primarily of non-japanese issuers and have longer maturities, thereby allowing us to improve our asset/liability matching and our overall investment returns. these securities were generally either privately negotiated arrangements or were issued under medium-term note programs and have standard documentation commensurate with credit ratings of the issuer, except when internal credit analysis indicates that additional protective and/or event-risk covenants were required. many of these investments have protective covenants appropriate to the specific investment. these may include a prohibition of certain activities by the borrower, maintenance of certain financial measures, and specific conditions impacting the payment of our notes.
below-investment-grade and split-rated securities we use specific criteria to judge the credit quality of both existing and prospective investments. the ratings referenced in the tables below are based on the ratings designations provided by the major credit rating agencies (moody's, s&p, and fitch) or, if not rated, are determined based on our internal credit analysis of such securities. when the ratings issued by the rating agencies differ, we utilize the second lowest rating, regardless of how many of the three rating agencies actually rated the instrument. split-rated securities are those where the ratings are not equivalent and one
or more of the ratings is investment grade and one or more is below investment grade. for these split-rated securities, if there are only two ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies, we take the lower below-investment-grade rating. if there are three ratings assigned, and two of the three are below investment grade, we consider it a below-investment-grade security. if there are three ratings and two are investment grade, we consider it an investment grade security unless our evaluation and assessment shows a below-investment-grade rating is warranted despite two of the three rating agencies rating it investment grade.
our portfolio of below-investment-grade securities includes debt securities purchased while the issuer was rated investment grade plus other loans and bonds purchased as part of an allocation to that segment of the market. the following is our below-investment-grade exposure in accordance with the above described rating methodology as of december 31.

yield on invested assets, achieving further diversification of credit risk, and mitigating the risk of rising interest rates through the acquisition of floating rate assets. our investments in this program totaled $1.4 billion at december 31, 2015, compared with $501 million at december 31, 2014, on an amortized cost basis.
in 2015, as part of our normal portfolio management and asset allocation process, we increased our allocation to higher yielding corporate bonds by approximately $644 million within the aflac japan portfolio and $120 million within the aflac u.s. portfolio. most of these securities were rated below-investment-grade at the time of purchase, but we also purchased several that are currently rated investment grade which, because of market pricing, offer yields commensurate with below-investment-grade risk profiles. the objective of this allocation is to enhance our yield on invested assets and further diversify our credit risk. all investments must have a minimum rating of low bb using our above described rating methodology and are managed by our internal credit portfolio management team.
excluding the senior secured bank loans and certain high yield corporate bonds discussed above that were rated below investment grade when initially purchased, below-investment-grade debt and perpetual securities represented 3.1% of total debt and perpetual securities at december 31, 2015, compared with 3.4% at december 31, 2014, on an amortized cost basis. debt and perpetual securities classified as below investment grade at december 31, 2015 and 2014 were generally reported as available for sale and carried at fair value.

for the foreign currency and credit default swaps associated with our vie investments for which we are the primary beneficiary, we bear the risk of foreign exchange and/or credit loss due to counterparty default even though we are not a direct counterparty to those contracts. we are a direct counterparty to the foreign currency swaps that we have on certain of our senior notes and subordinated debentures; foreign currency forwards; foreign currency options; and interest rate swaptions, therefore we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties in those contracts. the risk of counterparty default for our vie and senior note and subordinated debenture swaps, foreign currency forwards and options, and swaptions is mitigated by collateral posting requirements the counterparty must meet. if collateral posting agreements are not in place, the counterparty risk associated with foreign currency forwards and foreign currency options is the risk that at expiry of the contract, the counterparty is unable to deliver the agreed upon amount of yen at the agreed upon price or delivery date, thus exposing the company to additional unhedged exposure to u.s. dollars in the aflac japan investment portfolio. see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
equity risk market prices for equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. these fluctuations could impact the company's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

generally, declines in fair values can be a result of changes in interest rates, yen/dollar exchange rate, and changes in net spreads driven by a broad market move or a change in the issuer's underlying credit quality. in the fourth quarter of 2015, market volatility increased markedly, especially in the energy and commodity-related sectors. most of the declines noted above are related to issuers in those sectors. as we believe these issuers have the ability to continue making timely payments of principal and interest, we view these changes in fair value to be temporary and do not believe it is necessary to impair the carrying value of these securities. see the unrealized investment gains and losses section in note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussions of unrealized losses related to financial institutions, including perpetual securities, and other corporate investments.
investment valuation and cash we estimate the fair values of our securities on a monthly basis. we monitor the estimated fair values obtained from our custodian, pricing vendors and brokers for consistency from month to month, while considering current market conditions. we also periodically discuss with our custodian and pricing brokers and vendors the pricing techniques they use to monitor the consistency of their approach and periodically assess the appropriateness of the valuation level assigned to the values obtained from them. if a fair value appears unreasonable, we will re-examine the inputs and assess the reasonableness of the pricing data with the vendor. additionally, we may compare the inputs to relevant market indices and other performance measurements. the output of this analysis is presented to the company's valuation and classifications subcommittee, or vcs. based on the analysis provided to the vcs, the valuation is confirmed or may be revised if there is evidence of a more appropriate estimate of fair value based on available market data. we have performed verification of the inputs and calculations in any valuation models to confirm that the valuations represent reasonable estimates of fair value.
for those investments accounted for as loan receivables, we record those investments at amortized cost on the acquisition date and carry at adjusted amortized cost. the adjusted amortized cost of the loan receivables reflects
allowances for expected incurred losses estimated based on past events and current economic conditions as of each reporting date. see the loans and loan receivables section in note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these investments.
cash and cash equivalents totaled $4.4 billion, or 4.1% of total investments and cash, as of december 31, 2015, compared with $4.7 billion, or 4.3%, at december 31, 2014. for a discussion of the factors affecting our cash balance, see the operating activities, investing activities and financing activities subsections of this md&a.
for additional information concerning our investments, see notes 3, 4, and 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
deferred policy acquisition costs the following table presents deferred policy acquisition costs by segment for the years ended december 31.
(1) aflac japan's deferred policy acquisition costs increased 3.1% in yen during the year ended december 31, 2015.
see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our deferred policy acquisition costs.
policy liabilities the following table presents policy liabilities by segment for the years ended december 31.
(1) aflac japan's policy liabilities increased 5.3% in yen during the year ended december 31, 2015.
(2) elimination entry necessary due to recapture of a portion of policy liabilities ceded externally, as a result of the reinsurance retrocession transaction as described in note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
see note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our policy liabilities.
notes payable notes payable totaled $5.0 billion at december 31, 2015, compared with $5.3 billion at december 31, 2014.
in august 2015, we paid off $300 million of 3.45% fixed-rate senior notes upon their maturity and paid off a 5.0 billion yen loan at its maturity date (a total of approximately $41 million using the exchange rate at the specific maturity date). in july 2015, we paid off a 10.0 billion yen loan at its maturity date (a total of approximately $81 million using the exchange rate at the specific maturity date).
in march 2015, the parent company issued two series of senior notes totaling $1.0 billion through a u.s. public debt offering. the first series, which totaled $550 million, bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.40% per annum, payable semi-annually, and has a five-year maturity. the second series, which totaled $450 million, bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.25% per annum, payable semi-annually, and has a ten-year maturity. we have entered into cross-currency swaps that convert the u.s. dollar-denominated principal and interest on the senior notes into yen-denominated obligations which results in lower nominal net interest rates on the debt. by entering into these cross-currency swaps, we economically converted our $550 million liability into a 67.0 billion yen liability and reduced the interest rate on this debt from 2.40% in dollars to .24% in yen, and we economically converted our $450 million liability into a 55.0 billion yen liability and reduced the interest rate on this debt from 3.25% in dollars to .82% in yen. in april 2015, the parent company used the proceeds from the march 2015 issuance of its fixed-rate senior notes to redeem all of our $850 million 8.50% fixed-rate senior notes
see note 9 of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our notes payable.
benefit plans aflac japan and aflac u.s. have various benefit plans. for additional information on our japanese and u.s. plans, see note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
policyholder protection the japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. legislation enacted regarding the framework of the life insurance policyholder protection corporation (lippc) included government fiscal measures supporting the lippc. on december 27, 2011, japan's fsa announced the plans to enhance the stability of the lippc by extending the government's fiscal support of the lippc through march 2017. accordingly, the fsa submitted legislation to the diet on january 27, 2012 to extend the government's fiscal support framework, and the legislation was approved on march 30, 2012. effective april 2014, the annual lippc contribution amount for the total life industry was lowered from 40 billion yen to 33 billion yen. aflac japan paid 2.2 billion yen in both 2015 and 2014 and 2.3 billion yen in 2013 for the policyholder protection fund.
hedging activities net investment hedge our primary exposure to be hedged is our investment in aflac japan, which is affected by changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate. to mitigate this exposure, we have taken the following courses of action. first, aflac japan maintains certain unhedged u.s. dollar-denominated securities, which serve as an economic currency hedge of a portion of our investment in aflac japan. second, we have designated the majority of the parent company's yen-denominated liabilities (samurai and uridashi notes) as non-derivative hedging instruments and certain foreign currency forwards and options as derivative hedges of our net investment in aflac japan. we make our net investment hedge designation at the beginning of each quarter. if the total of the designated parent company non-derivative and derivatives notional is equal to or less than our net investment in aflac japan, the hedge is deemed to be effective, and the exchange effect on the yen-denominated liabilities and the change in estimated fair value of the derivatives are reported in the unrealized foreign currency component of other comprehensive income. we estimate that if the designated net investment hedge positions exceeded our net investment in aflac japan by 10 billion yen, we would report a foreign exchange gain/loss of approximately $1 million for every 1% yen weakening/strengthening in the end-of-period yen/dollar exchange rate. our net investment hedge was effective during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
the yen net asset figure calculated for hedging purposes differs from the yen-denominated net asset position as discussed in the currency risk subsection of md&a. as disclosed in that subsection, the consolidation of the underlying assets in certain vies requires that we derecognize our yen-denominated investment in the vie and recognize the underlying fixed-maturity or perpetual securities and cross-currency swaps. while these u.s. dollar investments will create foreign currency fluctuations, the combination of the u.s. dollar-denominated investment and the cross-currency swap economically creates a yen-denominated investment that qualifies for inclusion as a component of our investment in aflac japan. similarly, the combination of the u.s. corporate bonds and the foreign currency forwards and options that we have entered into, as discussed in the aflac japan investment subsection of md&a, economically creates a yen-denominated investment that qualifies for inclusion as a component of our investment in aflac japan.
consolidated yen-denominated net assets (liabilities)         $5,447                   $5,993
for the hedge of our net investment in aflac japan, we have designated certain of the parent company's yen-denominated liabilities, certain unhedged u.s. dollar investments and foreign currency forwards and options as a hedge of our net investment in aflac japan. our consolidated yen-denominated net asset position was partially hedged at $1.2 billion as of december 31, 2015, compared with $1.6 billion as of december 31, 2014.
cash flow hedges we had freestanding derivative instruments related to our consolidated vie investments that are reported in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within other assets and other liabilities. as of december 31, 2015, two of the freestanding swaps that are used within vies to hedge the risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates qualified for hedge accounting.
fair value hedges we have entered into foreign currency forwards and options to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with new investments in u.s. dollar-denominated fixed-maturities that support yen-denominated liabilities within our aflac japan segment.
at times we have entered into interest rate swaptions to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with our u.s. dollar-denominated fixed-maturities that support yen-denominated liabilities within our aflac japan segment.
see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our hedging activities.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2015, we had no material letters of credit, standby letters of credit, guarantees or standby repurchase obligations. see note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on material unconditional purchase obligations that are not recorded on our balance sheet.
capital resources and liquidity aflac provides the primary sources of liquidity to the parent company through dividends and management fees. the following table presents the amounts provided for the years ended december 31.
liquidity provided by aflac to parent company
the primary uses of cash by the parent company are shareholder dividends, the repurchase of its common stock, interest on its outstanding indebtedness and operating expenses. the parent company's sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable and are not expected to change materially in the future. for additional information, see the financing activities subsection of this md&a.
the parent company also accesses debt security markets to provide additional sources of capital. we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec in may 2015 that allows us to issue an indefinite amount of senior and subordinated debt, in one or more series, from time to time until may 2018. in march 2014, we filed a shelf registration statement with japanese regulatory authorities that allows us to issue up to 100 billion yen of yen-denominated samurai notes in japan through march 2016. if issued, these yen-denominated samurai notes would not be available to u.s. persons. we believe outside sources for additional debt and equity capital, if needed, will continue to be available. for additional information, see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
when making an investment decision, our first consideration is based on product needs. our investment objectives provide for liquidity through the purchase of investment-grade debt securities. these objectives also take into account duration matching, and because of the long-term nature of our business, we have adequate time to react to changing cash flow needs.
as a result of policyholder aging, claims payments are expected to gradually increase over the life of a policy. therefore, future policy benefit reserves are accumulated in the early years of a policy and are designed to help fund future claims payments. we expect our future cash flows from premiums and our investment portfolio to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for benefits and expenses.
in october 2015, the parent company and aflac jointly entered into a 364-day uncommitted bilateral line of credit that provides for borrowings in the amount of $100 million. borrowings will bear interest at the rate quoted by the bank and agreed upon at the time of making such loan and will have a three-month maturity period. there are no related facility fees, upfront expenses or financial covenant requirements. borrowings under this credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. borrowings under the financing agreement will mature no later than three months after the last drawdown date of october 15, 2016. as of december 31, 2015, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our $100 million credit agreement.
in september 2015, we amended and restated our 50.0 billion yen senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement, due to expire in march 2018, pursuant to which the parent company and aflac jointly entered into a new five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that provides for borrowings of up to 55.0 billion yen or the equivalent of yen in u.s. dollars on a revolving basis. borrowings bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) a eurocurrency rate determined by reference to the london interbank offered rate (libor) for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the federal funds effective rate plus 1⁄2 of 1%, (2) the rate of interest for such day announced by mizuho bank, ltd. as its prime rate and (3) the eurocurrency rate for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, in each case plus an applicable margin. the applicable margin ranges between .79% and 1.275% for eurocurrency rate borrowings and .0% and .275% for base rate borrowings, depending on the parent company's debt ratings as of the date of determination. in addition, the parent company and aflac are required to pay a facility fee on the commitments ranging between .085% and .225%, also based on the parent company's debt ratings as of the date of determination. borrowings under the amended and restated credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including a capital contingency plan for the operations of the parent company and aflac. the amended and restated credit facility requires compliance with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis and will expire on the earlier of (a) september 18, 2020, or (b) the date the commitments are terminated pursuant to an event of default, as such term is defined in the credit agreement. as of december 31, 2015, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our 55.0 billion yen revolving credit agreement.
in february 2015, the parent company and aflac jointly entered into an uncommitted bilateral line of credit with a third party that provides for borrowings in the amount of $50 million. borrowings will bear interest at the rate quoted by the bank and agreed upon at the time of making such loan and will have a three-month maturity period. there are no related facility fees, upfront expenses or financial covenant requirements. borrowings under this credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. as of december 31, 2015, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our $50 million credit agreement.
our financial statements convey our financing arrangements during the periods presented. we have not engaged in material intra-period short-term financings during the periods presented that are not otherwise reported in our balance sheet. we were in compliance with all of the covenants of our notes payable and lines of credit at december 31, 2015. we have not entered into transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase financial assets that have been accounted for as a sale under applicable accounting standards, including securities lending transactions. see notes 1, 3, and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our securities lending and derivative activities. with the exception of disclosed activities in those referenced footnotes, we do not have a known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty that would reasonably result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing by a material amount. our cash and cash equivalents include unrestricted cash on hand, money market instruments, and other debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less when purchased, all of which has minimal market, settlement or other risk exposure.
the following table presents the estimated payments by period of our major contractual obligations as of december 31, 2015. we translated our yen-denominated obligations using the december 31, 2015, exchange rate. actual future payments as reported in dollars will fluctuate with changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate.

liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $15 have been excluded from the tabular disclosure above because the timing of cash payment is not reasonably estimable.
(1)liability amounts are those reported on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2015.
(2)the estimated payments due by period reflect future estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and others for future policy benefits. these projected cash outflows are based on assumptions for future policy persistency, mortality, morbidity, and other assumptions comparable with our experience, consider future premium receipts on current policies in force, and assume market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs. these cash outflows are undiscounted with respect to interest and, as a result, the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of $234,854 exceeds the corresponding liability amount of $69,687. we have made significant assumptions to determine the future estimated cash outflows related to the underlying policies and contracts. due to the significance of the assumptions used, actual cash outflow amounts and timing will differ, possibly materially, from these estimates.
(4)not applicable for more information on our major contractual obligations, see the applicable note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as indicated in the line items in the table above.
consolidated cash flows we translate cash flows for aflac japan's yen-denominated items into u.s. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. in years when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. when the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported.

operating activities consolidated cash flow from operations increased 3.5% in 2015, compared with 2014. the following table summarizes operating cash flows by source for the years ended december 31.
investing activities operating cash flow is primarily used to purchase debt securities to meet future policy obligations. the following table summarizes investing cash flows by source for the years ended december 31.
prudent portfolio management dictates that we attempt to match the duration of our assets with the duration of our liabilities. currently, when our fixed-maturity securities and perpetual securities mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. however, the long-term nature of our business and our strong cash flows provide us with the ability to minimize the effect of mismatched durations and/or yields identified by various asset adequacy analyses. when needed or when market opportunities arise, we dispose of selected fixed-maturity and perpetual securities that are available for sale to improve the duration matching of our assets and liabilities, improve future investment yields, and/or re-balance our portfolio. as a result, dispositions before maturity can vary significantly from year to year. dispositions before maturity were approximately 5% of the annual average investment portfolio of fixed maturities and perpetual securities available for sale during the year ended december 31, 2015, compared with 6% in 2014 and 16% in 2013.
financing activities consolidated cash used by financing activities was $2.2 billion in 2015 and $147 million in 2014, compared with cash provided by financing activities of $1.1 billion in 2013.
in august 2015, we paid off $300 million of 3.45% fixed-rate senior notes upon their maturity. in august 2015, we paid off a 5.0 billion yen loan at its maturity date (a total of approximately $41 million using the exchange rate at the maturity date). in july 2015, we paid off a 10.0 billion yen loan at its maturity date (a total of approximately $81 million using the exchange rate at the maturity date).
in march 2015, the parent company issued two series of senior notes totaling $1.0 billion through a u.s. public debt offering. the first series, which totaled $550 million, bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.40% per annum, payable semi-annually, and has a five-year maturity. the second series, which totaled $450 million, bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.25% per annum, payable semi-annually, and has a ten-year maturity. we have entered into cross-currency swaps that convert the u.s. dollar-denominated principal and interest on the senior notes into yen-denominated obligations which results in lower nominal net interest rates on the debt. by entering into these cross-currency swaps, we economically converted our $550 million liability into a 67.0 billion yen liability and reduced the interest rate on this debt from 2.40% in dollars to .24% in yen, and we economically converted our $450 million liability into a 55.0 billion yen liability and reduced the interest rate on this debt from 3.25% in dollars to .82% in yen. in april 2015, the parent company used $1.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes that were issued in march 2015 to redeem all of our $850 million 8.50% fixed-rate senior notes due may 2019 and to pay a portion of the corresponding $230 million make-whole premium due to the investors of these notes. we consider the make-whole payment a non-recurring transaction and therefore excluded this charge from operating earnings.
in november 2014, the parent company issued $750 million of senior notes through a u.s. public debt offering. the net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. in july 2014, we redeemed 28.7 billion yen of our fixed rate samauri notes and 5.5 billion yen of our variable rate samurai notes upon their maturity (a total of approximately $335 million using the exchange rate on the date of redemption).
cash returned to shareholders through dividends and treasury stock purchases was $2.0 billion in 2015, compared with $1.9 billion in 2014 and $1.4 billion in 2013.
see our preceding discussion in this capital resources and liquidity section of md&a regarding the 364-day uncommitted bilateral line of credit entered into by the parent company and aflac in october 2015 in the amount of $100 million; the five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement entered into by the parent company and aflac in september 2015 in the amount of 55 billion yen; and the $50 million uncommitted bilateral line of credit entered into by the parent company and aflac in february 2015. as of december 31, 2015, no borrowings were outstanding under these lines of credit.
we were in compliance with all of the covenants of our notes payable and lines of credit at december 31, 2015.
the following tables present a summary of treasury stock activity during the years ended december 31.
under share repurchase authorizations from our board of directors, we purchased 21.2 million shares of our common stock in the open market in 2015, compared with 19.7 million shares in 2014 and 13.2 million shares in 2013. in august 2015, aflac's board of directors authorized the purchase of an additional 40 million shares of its common stock. as of december 31, 2015, a remaining balance of 48.4 million shares of our common stock was available for purchase under share repurchase authorizations by our board of directors. we currently plan to purchase $1.4 billion of our common stock in 2016, largely front-end loaded in the first half of the year. see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
cash dividends paid to shareholders in 2015 of $1.58 per share increased 5.3% over 2014. the 2014 dividend paid of $1.50 per share increased 5.6% over 2013. the following table presents the dividend activity for the years ended december 31.
regulatory restrictions aflac is domiciled in nebraska and is subject to its regulations. the nebraska department of insurance imposes certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends, management fees, loans and advances by aflac to the parent company. under nebraska insurance law, prior approval of the nebraska department of insurance is required for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net income from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year-end. in addition, the nebraska insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group of companies. these regulatory limitations are not expected to affect the level of management fees or dividends paid by aflac to the parent company. a life insurance company's statutory capital and surplus is determined according to rules prescribed by the naic, as modified by the insurance department in the insurance company's state of domicile. statutory accounting rules are different from u.s. gaap and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency. similar laws apply in new york and south carolina, the domiciliary jurisdictions of the parent company's other insurance subsidiaries, aflac new york and caic.
the continued long-term growth of our business may require increases in the statutory capital and surplus of our insurance operations. aflac's insurance operations may secure additional statutory capital through various sources, such as internally generated statutory earnings, equity contributions by the parent company from funds generated through debt or equity offerings, or reinsurance transactions. the naic's risk-based capital (rbc) formula is used by insurance regulators to help identify inadequately capitalized insurance companies. the rbc formula quantifies insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk by weighing the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurer's operations. aflac's company action level rbc ratio was 933% as of december 31, 2015, compared with 945% at december 31, 2014. aflac's rbc ratio remains high and reflects a strong capital and surplus position. as of december 31, 2015, aflac's total adjusted capital of $11.7 billion exceeded the company action level required capital and surplus of $1.3 billion by $10.4 billion. the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid to the parent company by aflac without prior approval of nebraska's director of insurance is the greater of the net income from operations, which excludes net realized investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year-end. dividends declared by aflac during 2016 in excess of $2.3 billion would require such approval. see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impact of permitted practices by the nebraska department of insurance on our statutory capital and surplus. the naic considers its solvency modernization initiative (smi) process relating to updating the u.s. insurance solvency regulation framework to be ongoing. the smi has focused on key issues such as capital requirements, governance and risk management, group supervision, reinsurance, statutory accounting and financial reporting matters. many of these key issues have been finalized and/or are near completion; however, the naic still has some ongoing initiatives related to smi, such as monitoring the international efforts on group capital requirements and group supervision as well as risk-based capital.
in addition to limitations and restrictions imposed by u.s. insurance regulators, japan's fsa may not allow profit repatriations from aflac japan if the transfers would cause aflac japan to lack sufficient financial strength for the protection of policyholders. the fsa maintains its own solvency standard which is quantified through the solvency margin ratio (smr). aflac japan's smr is sensitive to interest rate, credit spread and foreign exchange rate changes, therefore we continue to evaluate alternatives for reducing this sensitivity. in the event of a rapid change in market factors (such as interest rates), we have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of 55 billion yen and a committed reinsurance facility in the amount of approximately 110 billion yen as capital contingency plans (see notes 8 and 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information). we have already undertaken measures to mitigate the sensitivity of aflac japan's smr. for example, we employ policy reserve matching (prm), which is a japan-specific accounting treatment that reduces smr interest rate sensitivity since prm-designated investments are carried at amortized cost consistent with corresponding liabilities. for u.s. gaap, prm investments are categorized as available for sale. in the first quarter of 2015, aflac japan entered into a quota share arrangement to cede a portion of hospital benefits of one of our closed products. under this coinsurance indemnity type of reinsurance, aflac japan released approximately 130 billion yen of fsa reserves. (see notes 3, 4 and 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our investment strategies, hedging activities, and reinsurance, respectively.) as of december 31, 2015, aflac japan's smr was 828%, compared with 857% at december 31, 2014.
aflac is subject to the naic's own risk and solvency assessment (orsa), effective january 1, 2015. through the orsa requirements, aflac is expected to regularly, no less than annually, conduct an orsa to assess the adequacy of its risk management framework, and its current and estimated projected future solvency position; internally document the process and results of the assessment; and provide a confidential high-level orsa summary report annually to the lead state commissioner if the insurer is a member of an insurance group. aflac filed its orsa report on november 20, 2015 with the nebraska department of insurance.
payments are made from aflac japan to the parent company for management fees and to aflac u.s. for allocated expenses and remittances of earnings. the following table details aflac japan remittances for the years ended december 31.

in the fourth quarter of 2014, we began to increase the frequency of capital transfers from japan to the united states to better manage cash flow. this capital repatriation is reflected in aflac japan's smr as of december 31, 2015 and 2014.
we entered into foreign exchange forwards and options as part of an economic hedge on foreign exchange risk on 242.5 billion yen of profit repatriation received in 2015, resulting in $71 million of additional funds received when the yen were exchanged into dollars.

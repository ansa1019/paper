proposed acquisition of veda group limited on november 21, 2015, we entered into a scheme implementation deed (the "agreement") to acquire veda group limited ("veda") for cash consideration of approximately $1.7 billion (2.4 billion australian dollars) and debt assumed of approximately $188.4 million (261.5 million australian dollars). we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2016 and to finance the cash portion of the purchase price through a combination of cash on hand and new debt, including term loans, the 364-day revolver and commercial paper. the terms of the new debt instruments are included in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. the agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the company and veda, as well as customary covenants and agreements, including, among others, covenants providing for veda and each of its subsidiaries to conduct its business from the date of the agreement to the closing of the transaction in the ordinary course. the implementation of this binding agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, as well as shareholder and regulatory approvals in australia and new zealand, which have been completed.

segment and geographic information segments. the usis segment, the largest of our four segments, consists of three product and service lines: online information solutions; mortgage solutions; and financial marketing services. online information solutions and mortgage solutions revenue is principally transaction-based and is derived from our sales of products such as consumer and commercial credit reporting and scoring, identity management, fraud detection and modeling services. usis also markets certain decisioning software services, which facilitate and automate a variety of consumer and commercial credit-oriented decisions. financial marketing services revenue is principally project and subscription based and is derived from our sales of batch credit and consumer wealth information such as those that assist clients in acquiring new customers, cross selling to existing customers and managing portfolio risk.
the international segment consists of canada, europe and latin america. canada's products and services are similar to our usis offerings, while europe and latin america are made up of varying mixes of product lines that are in our usis reportable segment. in europe and latin america, we also provide information and technology services to support lenders and other creditors in the collections and recovery management process.
in 2015, the personal solutions business in the united kingdom was consolidated into the north america personal solutions segment, which was reorganized into the personal solutions segment. additionally in 2015, the direct to consumer reseller businesses in the u.s., canada, and the united kingdom were also consolidated into the personal solutions segment. these changes were driven by an enterprise wide strategy to maximize the penetration of our products and services in our
targeted markets. we determined that market focus and operating efficiency could be further improved by reorganizing and consolidating the united states, canada and the united kingdom personal solutions and direct to consumer reseller operating activities into one segment, personal solutions.
the workforce solutions segment consists of the verification services and employer services business lines. verification services revenue is transaction-based and is derived primarily from employment and income verification. employer services revenues are derived from our provision of certain human resources business process outsourcing services that include both transaction and subscription based product offerings. these services include unemployment claims management, employment-based tax credit services and other complementary employment-based transaction services, as well as our workforce analytics business including compliance with affordable care act.
personal solutions revenue is both transaction and subscription based and is derived from the sale of credit monitoring and identity theft protection products, which we deliver electronically to consumers primarily via the internet in the u.s., canada, and the u.k. we reach consumers directly and indirectly through partners.
geographic information. we currently operate in the following countries: argentina, brazil, canada, chile, costa rica, ecuador, el salvador, honduras, mexico, paraguay, peru, portugal, the republic of ireland, spain, the u.k., uruguay, and the u.s. our operations in the republic of ireland focus on data handling, software development and customer support activities. we have an investment in the second largest consumer and commercial credit information company in brazil and offer consumer credit services in india and russia through joint ventures. of the countries we operate in, 77% of our revenue was generated in the u.s. during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015.
key performance indicators. management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor operating and financial performance. these performance indicators include measurements of operating revenue, change in operating revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share, cash provided by operating activities and capital expenditures. key performance indicators for the twelve months ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, include the following:

business environment and company outlook demand for our services tends to be correlated to general levels of economic activity and to consumer credit activity, both enhanced by our own initiatives to expand our products and markets served, and to small commercial credit and marketing activity. in 2016, in the united states, we expect modest growth in overall economic activity and consumer credit. mortgage market originations are expected to be relatively flat to slightly down for the year. internationally, the environment continues to be challenging as various countries address their particular political, fiscal and economic issues. in addition, weaker foreign exchange rates, compared to the prior year, will negatively impact both growth in revenue and profit when reported in u.s. dollars.
over the long term, we expect that our ongoing investments in new product innovation, business execution, enterprise growth initiatives, technology infrastructure, and continuous process improvement will enable us to deliver long-term average organic revenue growth ranging between 6% and 8% with additional growth of 1% to 2% derived from strategic acquisitions
consistent with our long-term business strategy. we also expect to grow earnings per share at a somewhat faster rate than revenue over time as a result of both operating and financial leverage.

revenue for 2015 increased by 9% compared to 2014. this broad-based growth was organic, and was driven by revenue increases in mortgage, direct to consumer reseller, healthcare, government, and auto verticals. the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by $75.7 million or 3% in 2015 compared to 2014.
revenue for 2014 increased by 6% compared to 2013. the growth was driven by the acquisition of tdx in the first quarter of 2014 ("tdx acquisition") and the impact of strategic growth initiatives across our businesses. the growth was offset by the expected decline in mortgage market activity. the fourth quarter of 2014 benefited from the relative improvement in mortgage activity in the u.s., which declined in the second half of 2013 through 2014, but at a lesser rate in fourth quarter of 2014.  this expected decline reduced reported growth rates in our usis and workforce solutions business units for 2014 as compared to the same period for 2013.  the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by $34.9 million or 1% in the 2014 compared to 2013.

cost of services. cost of services increased $42.7 million in 2015 compared to the prior year. the increase in cost of services, when compared to 2014, was due to the increase in production costs driven by higher revenues, as well as increases in people costs, and to a lesser extent an increase in professional services. the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by $25.3 million.
cost of services increased $57.4 million in 2014 compared to the prior year. the increase in cost of services, when compared to 2013, was due primarily to the acquisition of tdx in the first quarter of 2014 and the 2013 acquisitions. the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by $7.7 million.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $132.6 million in 2015 as compared to 2014.  the increase was principally due to increases in people costs, and to a lesser extent to increases in marketing expenses, professional fees, as well as litigation expenses. the increase was also due to the costs related to the realignment of internal resources of $20.7 million recorded in the first quarter of 2015. the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling, general and administrative expenses by $24.6 million.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $35.9 million in 2014 as compared to 2013.  the increase was due to the impact of the tdx acquisition in the first quarter of 2014 and the 2013 acquisitions, an increase in litigation and regulatory compliance expenses, including a third quarter 2014 settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreements, and an increase in incentives. these increases were partially offset by decreases in marketing and professional services expenses, as well as smaller decreases in expense in various other categories. the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling, general and administrative expenses by $6.8 million.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization expense for 2015 were slightly lower compared to 2014, due to foreign currency fluctuations of $4.1 million.
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2014, as compared to 2013, was driven by $18.5 million of incremental expense resulting from the tdx acquisition primarily related to amortization of purchased intangibles.  the tdx acquisition amortization is partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets related to the talx acquisition in 2007 that became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2013.

total company margin decreased slightly in 2014 due to a third quarter 2014 settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreements and increased cost of services and acquisition-related amortization expense related to the acquisition of tdx. the decrease was partially offset by a reduction in amortization of certain purchased intangible assets related to our talx corporation acquisition in 2007 that became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2013.
interest expense and other income (expense), net twelve months ended december 31,       change
interest expense decreased slightly in 2014, when compared to 2013, due to the pay-off of our 7.34% notes and 4.45% senior notes during 2014.  our consolidated debt balance increased, as compared to the prior year, as a result of commercial paper issued to fund the majority of the acquisition price of tdx.  the decrease in the average cost of debt for 2014 is due to the pay-off of our 7.34% notes and 4.45% senior notes and additional low rate commercial paper outstanding on average, which caused the average cost of debt to decrease as compared to the prior year.
the increase in other income (expense), net, in 2015 is due to the settlement of escrow amounts related to an acquisition from january 2014, and the gain on foreign currency options put in place as an economic hedge of veda's purchase price, partially offset by impairment of our cost method investment in brazil in the second quarter of 2015.
the increase in other income (expense), net, in 2014 is due to the impairment of our cost method investment in brazil recorded in 2013, which did not recur in 2014. other income (expense), net in 2014 also includes $7.0 million in foreign exchange losses related to dividends declared by our subsidiary in argentina and losses incurred in repatriating these funds.  these losses were partially offset by an increase in our equity in the earnings of our russian joint venture.

overall, our effective tax rate was 31.7% for 2015, down from 34.9% for the same period in 2014. the 2015 rate benefited by 2% due to international related items specifically the increased recognition of foreign tax credits and the permanent item associated with the settlement of escrows related to past acquisitions, and 1.4% due to the state law changes.
overall, our effective tax rate was 34.9% for 2014, down from 35.6% for the same period in 2013.  the 2014 rate benefited by 1.1% as compared to the 2013 rate due to the favorable impact of 2014 international, permanent and discrete items.  the 2014 effective rate increased by 0.4% as compared to 2013 due to increases in state income tax rates, which became effective or enacted in 2014.

consolidated net income from continuing operations increased by $60.8 million, or 16%, in 2015 compared to 2014 due to increased operating income in our usis and workforce solutions businesses. this increase was partially offset by declines due to foreign exchange rates that impacted the international operating segment, declines in the personal solutions operating segment, as well as increased corporate expenses due significantly to the realignment of our internal resources, and increases in people costs.
consolidated net income from continuing operations increased by $32.5 million, or 10%, in 2014 compared to 2013 due to increased operating income in our usis, workforce solutions and personal solutions operating segments, and a lower effective income tax rate, partially offset by declines in the international operating segment. the increase in net income attributable to equifax for 2014, as compared to the prior year, was partially offset by the absence of earnings from the discontinued operations, including a gain on the disposition of those operations, which benefited the prior year period.

revenue increased 5% in 2014 compared to prior year, due to strong growth in non-mortgage verticals, which was partially offset by the expected decline in mortgage-related verification revenue in 2014 driven by the anticipated decline in mortgage market activity in 2014. the revenue growth in non-mortgage verticals was primarily a result of increased revenue mostly related to government, pre-employment and auto segments.
employer services. revenue grew 8% in 2015, as compared to 2014. revenue growth was due to continued higher employment based tax credit activity due to the delayed approval of the federal work opportunity tax credit program for 2014, as well as growth in our employer-based compliance solutions and workforce analytics business.
revenue grew 1% in 2014, as compared to 2013. revenue growth was due to growth in our transaction-based services business and workforce analytics business. the growth in 2014 was partially offset by lower unemployment claims activity and a decline in revenue related to the non-renewal of the federal work opportunity tax credit program in 2014.
workforce solutions operating margin. operating margin increased 510 basis points to 37.9% in 2015 as compared to 32.8% in 2014. margin expansion in 2015 was driven by product mix, as well as strong revenue growth in 2015. operating margin for 2014 increased to 32.8% compared to 30.1% in prior year. margin expansion in 2014 was driven by a higher mix of high margin business compared to 2013, as well as cost management initiatives executed during the year. margin improvement was also driven by lower acquisition-related amortization due to certain purchased intangible assets related to our talx corporation acquisition in 2007 that became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2013.

revenue increased 6% for 2014, as compared to prior year. local currency revenue grew 6% principally due to the growth in canada and the u.k. consumer direct revenue, and to a lesser extent, in the u.s. consumer direct revenue. this growth was partially offset by declines in consumer reseller revenue. local currency fluctuations against the u.s. dollar positively impacted revenue by $0.7 million, or less than 1%, for 2014. operating margin increased in 2014 to 31.8% as compared to 28.6% in prior year, as increased salaries, legal expenses and acquisition-related amortization due to the acquisition of trustedid in the third quarter of 2013 was more than offset by lower marketing expenses.
general corporate expense twelve months ended december 31,                                change
our general corporate expenses are unallocated costs that are incurred at the corporate level and include those expenses impacted by corporate direction, including shared services, administrative, legal, restructuring, and the portion of management incentive compensation determined by total company-wide performance. general corporate expense increased $66.9 million in 2015, of which $20.7 million relates to the realignment of internal resources in the first quarter of 2015, and increases in people costs, and to a lesser extent to increases in professional fees, as well as litigation expenses.
liquidity and financial condition management assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing and financing activities. we continue to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remain in a strong financial position managing our capital structure to meet short- and long-term objectives including reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions.
sources and uses of cash funds generated by operating activities and our credit facilities continue to be our most significant sources of liquidity. we expect that funds generated from results of operations will be sufficient to finance our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements (such as capital expenditures, interest payments, debt payments, potential pension funding contributions and dividend payments) for the foreseeable future. in the event that credit market conditions were to deteriorate, we would rely more heavily on borrowings from the senior credit facility, as described below. on november 21, 2015, the company refinanced the existing unsecured revolving credit facility of $750.0 million set to expire on december 19, 2017, and entered into a new credit agreement (the "senior credit facility"). the senior credit facility includes a revolving credit facility of $900.0 million ("revolver") and a delayed draw term loan of $800.0 million ("term loan facility"), with maturity dates of november 21, 2020 and november 21, 2018, respectively, with an option to extend the maturity of the revolving credit facility by an additional two years. the senior credit facility allows the company to request incremental loans of up to $300.0 million.  borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchase programs. availability of the senior credit facility for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any letters of credit issued under the facility and, pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization, by the outstanding principal amount of our commercial paper notes. additionally, the company entered into an $800.0 million 364-day revolving credit facility on november 21, 2015 (the "364-day revolver" and together with the revolver and the term loan facility, the "senior credit facilities"). the 364-day revolver has a maturity date of november 19, 2016. the commitments under the term loan facility and the 364-day revolver will be funded following the shareholder and court approval. refer to note 16 for further discussion. the term loan facility and the 364-day revolver provide that the company may, upon notice to the administrative agent, terminate or permanently reduce any class of commitments. commitments with respect to the 364-day revolver will also be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the extent the company issues other senior indebtedness. the company plans to replace some of the senior credit facilities with senior notes in the future.
at december 31, 2015, $852.3 million was available to borrow under our senior credit facility. our senior credit facility does not include a provision under which lenders could refuse to allow us to borrow under this facility in the event of a material adverse change in our financial condition, as long as we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the lending agreement.
information about our cash flows, by category, is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows. the following table summarizes our cash flows for the twelve months ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:

operating activities cash provided by operating activities for 2015 increased by $125.9 million over the prior year, due to $75.6 million growth in net income, adjusted for the brazil impairment, and improvements in working capital, notably an increase in current liabilities related to current payables, incentives and unearned income.
cash provided by operating activities for 2014 increased by $47.2 million over the prior year.  cash provided from net income, excluding the impact of the 2013 divestitures, the impairment of our cost method investment in 2013, the impact of depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense, increased $35.9 million. the remaining increase in cash from operations was driven by changes in net working capital in 2014 as compared to 2013.
fund transfer limitations. the ability of certain of our subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds to us is limited, in some cases, by certain restrictions imposed by foreign governments, such as argentina; these restrictions do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially limit our ability to service our indebtedness, meet our current obligations or pay dividends. we currently hold $86.8 million of cash in our foreign subsidiaries.

our capital expenditures are used for developing, enhancing and deploying new and existing software in support of our expanding product set, replacing or adding equipment, updating systems for regulatory compliance, licensing of standard software applications, investing in system reliability, security and disaster recovery enhancements, and updating or expanding our office facilities.
capital expenditures in 2015 increased from 2014, as we are continuing to invest in new products and technology infrastructure. capital expenditures in 2014 were comparable to 2013.

2015 acquisitions and investments. during the first quarter of 2015, we acquired a 75% equity interest investment in a debt collections and recovery management venture in the u.k., as more fully described in note 1. during the third quarter of 2015, we received $2.9 million proceeds from the escrow related to a past disposition. we did not make significant investments in unconsolidated affiliates during 2015.
2014 acquisitions and investments. during the first quarter of 2014, we acquired tdx, included as part of our international operating segment, and forseva, included as part of our usis operating segment. during the first quarter of 2013, we divested two non-strategic business lines, equifax settlement services which was part of our mortgage business within the usis operating segment and talent management services which was part of our employer services business within our workforce solutions operating segment, for a total of $47.5 million. $3.5 million of the proceeds of the sale of talent management services was placed into an escrow account to be released to us at a later date. during 2014, we received $0.6 million of the proceeds from the escrow.
we invested $2.5 million in our joint venture in india during 2014. this investment was more than offset by dividends received from our joint venture in russia.
2013 acquisitions and investments. during the third quarter of 2013, we acquired trustedid, a direct-to-consumer identity protection business that is included as part of our personal solutions business unit. during the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed two acquisitions in paraguay and mexico in the latin america region of our international segment.
in the first quarter of 2013, we divested of two non-strategic business lines, as discussed above, for a total of $47.5 million. $3.5 million of the proceeds of the sale of talent management services was placed into an escrow account and was released to us in 2015 and 2014.  we also divested of three other small non-strategic operations.
we invested $8.0 million in our joint ventures in 2013 to increase our percentage ownership interest in russia, and as a general capital call in india, as well as $1.1 million in another international entity.

credit facility availability. our principal unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks, which we refer to as the revolver, permits us to borrow up to $900.0 million through november 2020. the revolver may be used for general corporate purposes. availability of the revolver for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any letters of credit issued under the facility and, pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization, by the outstanding principal amount of our commercial paper (cp) notes.
our $900.0 million cp program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of cp with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days. we may use the proceeds of cp for general corporate purposes. the cp program is supported by our revolver and, pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization, the total amount of cp which may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our revolver.
at december 31, 2015, the company had $47.2 million of cp and $0.5 million of letters of credit outstanding, and there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolver. at december 31, 2015, a total of $852.3 million was available under the revolver.
at december 31, 2015, approximately 96% of our debt was fixed rate and 4% was effectively variable rate. our variable-rate debt consists of our issued commercial paper, which bears short-term interest rates based on the cp market for investment grade issuers. the interest rates reset periodically, depending on the terms of the respective financing arrangements. at december 31, 2015, interest rates on our variable-rate debt ranged from 0.65% to 0.75%.
the obligations of the lenders to fund the term loan facility and the 364-day revolver are subject to certain conditions, including the approval by veda shareholders of the acquisition and the nonoccurence of a material adverse change related to veda. refer to note 16 for further discussion.
borrowing and repayment activity. net short-term borrowings (repayments) primarily represent borrowings or repayments of outstanding amounts under our cp program. we primarily borrow under our cp program, as needed and availability allows.
the decrease in net short-term (repayments) borrowings primarily relates the net activity of cp notes in 2015, and reflects the increase in cash flow from operations as well as no material acquisitions entered into during the year. the increase in net short-term borrowings (repayments) in 2014 primarily reflects the borrowing of cp notes in the first quarter of 2014 to fund the acquisition of tdx, as well as the 2014 pay-off of our $15.0 million 7.34% notes and $275.0 million 4.45% senior notes, outstanding at december 31, 2013, with borrowings under our cp program.
the increase in payments on long-term debt in 2014 reflects the pay-off of our $15.0 million 7.34% notes and $275.0 million 4.45% senior notes, outstanding at december 31, 2013, with borrowings under our cp program.
the increase in debt issuance costs in 2015 reflects the debt issuance costs paid in connection with the new senior credit facilities entered into in november 2015.
debt covenants. the outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including, for example, limits on secured debt and sale/leaseback transactions. in addition, the senior credit facilities requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 3.5 to 1.0, and limits the amount of subsidiary debt. the company's leverage ratio was 1.26 at december 31, 2015. none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and, as of december 31, 2015, the company was in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
the company does not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of the outstanding debt; however, the 6.3% senior notes due 2017, 3.3% senior notes due 2022 and 7.0% senior notes due 2037 (together, the "senior notes") contain change in control provisions. if the company experiences a change of control or publicly announce the company's intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard & poor's, or s&p, and moody's investors service, or moody's, below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof, then the company will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.
credit ratings. credit ratings reflect an independent agency's judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. the ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower's industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company's cash flows to changes in the economy. the two largest rating agencies, s&p and moody's, use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. the highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is aaa and aaa for s&p and moody's, respectively. a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.
long-term ratings of bbb- and baa3 or better by s&p and moody's, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be "investment grade". at december 31, 2015, the long-term ratings for our obligations were bbb+ and baa1, which are consistent with the ratings and outlooks which existed at december 31, 2014. a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and credit facilities, and could limit, or in the case of a significant downgrade, preclude our ability to issue cp. if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels, we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt. in addition, the market's demand for, and thus our ability to readily issue, new debt could become further affected by the economic and credit market environment.
for additional information about our debt, including the terms of our financing arrangements, basis for variable interest rates and debt covenants, see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report.

sources and uses of cash related to equity during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:
•   under share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors, we repurchased 2.1 million, 3.9 million, and 0.2 million common shares during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for $196.3 million, $301.6 million and $11.9 million, respectively, at an average price per common share of $94.97, $76.55 and $59.74, respectively. as of december 31, 2015, under the existing board authorization, the company is approved for additional stock repurchases valued at $667.2 million.
•   during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we paid cash dividends to equifax shareholders of $137.8 million, $121.2 million and $106.7 million, respectively, at $1.16 per share for 2015, $1.00 per share for 2014 and $0.88 per share for 2013.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2015. the table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or factors uncertain at this time. some of the excluded commitments are discussed below the footnotes to the table.
data processing, outsourcing agreements and other purchase obligations (3)          74.2                    52.6                      18.0                      3.2                      0.4
other long-term liabilities (4) (6)                                                110.5                     7.1                      15.1                     12.8                     75.5
(1)   the amounts are gross of unamortized discounts totaling $(1.6) million at december 31, 2015. total debt on our consolidated balance sheets is net of the unamortized discounts and fair value adjustments. there were no fair value adjustments to our debt at december 31, 2015.
(2)   our operating lease obligations principally involve office space and equipment, which include the ground lease associated with our headquarters building that expires in 2048.
(3)   these agreements primarily represent our minimum contractual obligations for services that we outsource associated with our computer data processing operations and related functions, and certain administrative functions. these agreements expire between 2016 and 2023.
(4)   these long-term liabilities primarily relate to obligations associated with certain pension, postretirement and other compensation-related plans, some of which are discounted in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap. we made certain assumptions about the timing of such future payments. in the table above, we have not included amounts related to future pension plan obligations, as such required funding amounts beyond 2016 have not been deemed necessary due to our current expectations regarding future plan asset performance.
(5)   for future interest payments on variable-rate debt, which are generally based on a specified margin plus a base rate (libor) or on cp rates for investment grade issuers, we used the variable rate in effect at december 31, 2015 to calculate these payments. our variable rate debt at december 31, 2015, consisted of cp. future interest payments related to our senior credit facility and our cp program are based on the borrowings outstanding at december 31, 2015 through their respective maturity dates, assuming such borrowings are outstanding until that time. the variable portion of the rate at december 31, 2015 ranged from 0.65% to 0.75% for all of our variable-rate debt. future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity and interest rates.
(6)   this table excludes $24.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.
off-balance sheet transactions on november 21, 2015, we entered into the agreement to acquire veda for a cash consideration of approximately $1.7 billion (2.4 billion australian dollars) and debt assumed of approximately $188.4 million (261.5 million australian dollars). we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2016. the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, as disclosed above.
refer to item 1a "risk factors" and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the proposed acquisition of veda.
we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing activities.
pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds, we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of $108.5 million and $92.3 million, as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, to a local governmental authority in the u.s. to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development. the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds. these fixed assets are still recognized on the company's consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company.
letters of credit and guarantees we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit, performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business. the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december 31, 2015, and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less. guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units. the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31, 2015.
benefit plans we sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan (the u.s. retirement income plan, or usrip) that covers approximately 20% of current u.s. salaried employees who were hired on or before june 30, 2007, the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the usrip was frozen to new participation at december 31, 2008. this plan also covers many retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status. we also sponsor a defined benefit plan that covers most salaried and hourly employees in canada (the canadian retirement income plan, or crip). the crip was frozen to new participants entering the plan on or after october 1, 2011.
at december 31, 2015, the usrip met or exceeded erisa's minimum funding requirements. during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, we did not make any contributions to the usrip.  we contributed $0.2 million and $1.2 million to the crip during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. in the future, we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions, depending on certain circumstances, including market conditions and liquidity needs. we believe additional funding contributions, if any, would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs, which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and our credit facilities.
for our non-u.s., tax-qualified retirement plans, we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations. for the non-qualified supplementary retirement plans, we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants, but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap.
for additional information about our benefit plans, see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report.
seasonality we experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams. revenue generated from the employer services business unit within the workforce solutions operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of form w-2 preparation services, which occur in the first quarter each year. revenue from our online information solutions and mortgage solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions, most commonly the second and third calendar quarters. revenues in our financial marketing services business line within usis are typically highest in the fourth quarter each year due to the timing of certain significant annual renewals of project-based agreements. on a consolidated basis, combining all of these businesses, and assuming normal economic conditions, first quarter revenue is normally the lowest quarterly revenue of the year, and the fourth quarter is the highest.
effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates equifax's operating results are not materially affected by inflation, although inflation may result in increases in the company's expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered. to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments, it may adversely affect the company's financial position and profitability.
a portion of the company's business is conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar can therefore affect the value of non-u.s. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored. we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates, although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency.
recent accounting pronouncements for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report.
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap. this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements. the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made. in addition, while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results. for additional information about these policies, see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report. although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information available at the time. actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured, the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed. a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis, in which case revenue is recognized, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, when the services are provided. a smaller portion of our revenues relate to subscription-based contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period, generally one year. revenue related to subscription-based contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided, using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed. any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contract's subscription period. revenue related to subscription-based contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term. revenue is recorded net of sales taxes.
if at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment. if there is uncertainty as to the customer's acceptance of our deliverables, revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. if at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
the determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates, principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears. in these instances, we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past. differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported. we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past. we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future. if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates, revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained. also within our workforce solutions operating segment, the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our
clients. revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones, upon calculation of the credit, or when the credit is utilized by our client, depending on the provisions of the client contract.
we have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements. the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information, file updates for certain solutions, services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel, training services, statistical models and other services. to account for each of these elements separately, the delivered elements must have stand-alone value to our customer. if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting, we apply one of the accounting policies described above. this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract.
many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments. no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or, in most cases, purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement. some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases. these development services do not meet the requirement for having stand-alone value, thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service. revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract.
we have some multiple element arrangements that include software.  we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery, in accordance with the applicable guidance.
we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction.
the debt collections and recovery management revenue is calculated as a percentage of debt collected on behalf of the customer and, as such, is primarily recognized when the cash is collected assuming all  other revenue recognition criteria are met.
deferred revenue consists of amounts billed and collected in excess of revenue recognized on sales relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having stand-alone value discussed above. deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies.
judgments and uncertainties - each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables. these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value; concluding when the element will be delivered; evaluating collectibility; and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services.
in addition, as stated above, the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates, principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears. in these instances, we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past. differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported.
effects if actual results differ from assumptions - we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services and tax management services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past. we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future. if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates, revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future, we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually (as of september 30) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance or trends, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. we have seven reporting units comprised of u.s. information solutions (which includes part of online information solutions, mortgage solutions and financial marketing services), europe, latin america, canada, personal solutions, verification services, and employer services. based on the company's enterprise-wide strategy, we've consolidated the identity management reporting unit with the u.s. information solutions reporting unit in 2015. we performed goodwill impairment tests prior to and following the consolidation for usis and identity management reporting units, which resulted in no impairment.
the goodwill balance at december 31, 2015, for our seven reporting units was as follows:
u.s. information solutions      $1,071.3
qualitative assessments we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing was necessary for all of our reporting units. in this qualitative assessment, we considered the following items for each of the reporting units: macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance and other entity specific events. in addition, for each of these reporting units, the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units. based on these assessments, we determined the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not. as a result of our conclusions, no further testing was required for all of our reporting units.
loss contingencies we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business. we determine whether to disclose and/or accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is estimable, probable, reasonably possible or remote.
judgments and uncertainties - we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors. if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated amount. if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible, but not probable, we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency. our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions - we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies. however, if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates, we may be exposed to a loss that could be material.
income taxes we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid. we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies. to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable.
our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities. we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations. we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals.
judgments and uncertainties - we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets. these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income, mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions, and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and, if so, the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements. we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense. settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash. at december 31, 2015, $24.6 million was recorded for uncertain tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of which it is reasonably possible that up to $9.4 million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions - although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material.
pension and other postretirement plans we consider accounting for our u.s. and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, which include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, interest cost and mortality and retirement rates. actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost.
during 2015 we adopted the new generational projection scale with mp-2015 in determining the liability for the u.s. pensions plan. this updated scale, along with the change in the discount rate, contributed to the decrease in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31, 2015.
during 2014, the we adopted the new rp-2014 mortality tables and generational projection scale with mp-2014 in determining the liability for the u.s. pensions plan. this new table, along with the change in the discount rate, contributed to the increase in the projected benefit obligation as of december 31, 2014.
judgments and uncertainties - we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are (1) the discount rate and (2) the expected return on plan assets, in each case as it relates to our u.s. pension plan. our canadian plan is not significant, and the impact of changes in assumptions for that plan is not material.
we determine our discount rates primarily based on high-quality, fixed-income investments and yield-to-maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date. discount rates are updated annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions. we use a third-party yield curve to develop our discount rates. the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated high-quality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period, from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan.
the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class, as provided by our external investment advisor. in 2015, the u.s. pension plan investment losses of 1.1% were below the expected return of 7.5% for the second time in seven years. the expected return for the usrip for 2016 is at 7.25%, which is a reduction from the rate used for 2015. the crip earned 2.9% in 2015 which was below its expected return of 6.75% for the second time in seven years. the expected return for the crip for 2016 is at 6.0%, which is a reduction from
the rate used for 2015. the crip has a lower expected return due to a higher asset allocation to fixed income securities. our weighted-average expected rate of return for both plans for 2016 is 7.12% which is slightly lower than the 2015 expected rate.
annual differences, if any, between the expected and actual returns on plan assets are included in unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss, a component of other comprehensive income. in calculating the annual amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss, we use a market-related value of assets that smooths actual investment gains and losses on plan assets over a period up to five years. the resulting unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount is recognized in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all participants are inactive.  the market-related value of our assets was $543.3 million at december 31, 2015. we do not expect our 2016 net periodic benefit cost, which includes the effect of the market-related value of assets, to be materially different than our 2015 cost. see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions - we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations. adjusting our weighted-average expected long-term rate of return (7.12% at december 31, 2015) by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2016 by approximately $2.7 million. adjusting our weighted-average discount rate (4.86% at december 31, 2015) by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2016 by approximately $0.4 million. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material.
purchase accounting for acquisitions we account for acquisitions under accounting standards codification 805, business combinations, which changed the application of the acquisition method of accounting in a business combination and also modified the way assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on a prospective basis. in general, the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition. we primarily estimate fair value of identified intangible assets using discounted cash flow analyses based on market participant based inputs. any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets. transaction costs, as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies, are expensed as incurred in our consolidated statements of income.
judgments and uncertainties - we consider accounting for business combinations critical because management's judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and amortization periods for intangible assets, which can materially affect the our results of operations.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions - although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to an impairment charge if we are unable to recover the value of the recorded net assets.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto.
critical accounting policies our md&a discusses our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with united states ("u.s.") generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap").  our financial statements are affected by our judgments, assumptions and estimates.  the notes to our december 31, 2015 financial statements, primarily note 2, summarize our significant accounting policies.
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies, because they have a material impact on the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.
income tax expense: we have elected to be treated as a reit, as defined in the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code").  as a reit, we do not incur federal income tax on our reit taxable income that is fully distributed each year (for this purpose, certain distributions paid in a subsequent year may be considered), and if we meet certain organizational and operational rules.  we believe we have met these reit requirements for all periods presented herein.  accordingly, we have recorded no federal income tax expense related to our reit taxable income.
our evaluation that we have met the reit requirements could be incorrect, because compliance with the tax rules requires factual determinations, and circumstances we have not identified could result in noncompliance with the tax requirements in current or prior years.  for any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a reit and for which applicable statutory relief provisions did not apply, we would be taxed at the regular corporate rates on all of our taxable income for at least that year and the ensuing four years, we could be subject to penalties and interest, and our net income would be materially different from the amounts estimated in our financial statements.
in addition, our taxable reit subsidiaries are taxable as regular corporations.  to the extent that amounts paid to us by our taxable reit subsidiaries are determined by the taxing authorities to not be reasonable when compared to similar arrangements among unrelated parties, we could be subject to a 100% penalty tax on the excess payments.  such a penalty tax could have a material adverse impact on our net income.
impairment of long-lived assets: the analysis of impairment of our long-lived assets involves identification of indicators of impairment, projections of future operating cash flows, and estimates of fair values, all of which require significant judgment and subjectivity.  others could come to materially different conclusions.  in addition, we may not have identified all current facts and circumstances that may affect impairment.  any unidentified impairment loss, or change in conclusions, could have a material adverse impact on our net income.
accrual for uncertain and contingent liabilities:  we accrue for certain contingent and other liabilities that have significant uncertain elements, such as property taxes, workers compensation claims, tenant reinsurance claims, as well as other legal claims and disputes involving customers, employees, governmental agencies and other third parties.  such liabilities we are aware of are estimated based upon many factors such as assumptions of past and future trends and our evaluation of likely outcomes.  however, the estimates of known liabilities could be incorrect or we may not be aware of all such liabilities, in which case our accrued liabilities and net income could be misstated.
accounting for acquired real estate facilities: we estimate the fair values of the land, buildings and intangible assets acquired for purposes of allocating the purchase price.  such estimates are based upon
many assumptions and judgments, including (i) market rates of return and capitalization rates on real estate and intangible assets, (ii) building and material cost levels, (iii) comparisons of the acquired underlying land parcels to recent land transactions, and (iv) future cash flows from the real estate and the existing tenant base.  others could come to materially different conclusions as to the estimated fair values, which would result in different depreciation and amortization expense, gains and losses on sale of real estate assets, and real estate and intangible assets.
md&a overview our self-storage operations generated most of our net income for all periods presented.  accordingly, a significant portion of management's time is devoted to maximizing cash flows from our existing self-storage facilities, as well as seeking additional investments in self-storage facilities.
most of our facilities compete with other well-managed and well-located competitors and we are subject to general economic conditions, particularly those that affect the spending habits of consumers and moving trends.  we believe that our centralized information networks, national telephone and online reservation system, the brand name "public storage," and our economies of scale enable us to meet such challenges effectively.
during 2015, 2014 and 2013, we acquired 17, 44 and 121 facilities, respectively, from third parties for approximately $169 million, $431 million and $1.2 billion, respectively.  subsequent to december 31, 2015, we acquired or were under contract to acquire 17 self-storage facilities with 1.2 million net rentable square feet for $149 million. we will continue to seek to acquire properties; however, there is significant competition to acquire existing facilities and there can be no assurance as to the level of facilities we may acquire.
since the beginning of 2013, we opened development and expansion projects with a total cost of $307 million, adding approximately 3.1 million net rentable square feet.  as of december 31, 2015, we had additional projects which will add approximately 3.7 million net rentable square feet of storage space at a total cost of approximately $486 million.  a total of $219 million in costs were incurred through december 31, 2015 with respect to these projects, with the remaining costs expected to be incurred primarily in 2016.  we expect to continue to seek additional development projects; however, the level of future development may be limited due to various constraints such as difficulty in finding available sites that meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations, as well as challenges in obtaining building permits for self-storage activities in certain municipalities.
we believe that our real estate development activities are beneficial to our business operations over the long run.  however, in the short run, due to the three to four year period that it takes to fill up newly developed storage space and achieve a stabilized level of cash flows, our earnings are diluted because earnings from those newly developed and expanded facilities are less than the cost of the capital required in order to fund the development cost.  we believe that this dilution will grow in 2016 and beyond due to the increasing level of development and unstabilized properties in our portfolio.
we also have equity investments in shurgard europe and ps business parks, inc. ("psb").  we may make further investments in these companies.
as of december 31, 2015, we have capital resources well in excess of our current planned capital needs over the next year totaling $445 million.  our capital resources include: (i) $104 million of cash as of december 31, 2015, (ii) $485 million of available borrowing capacity on our revolving line of credit, (iii) $250 million to $300 million of expected retained operating cash flow for the next twelve months, and (iv) $290 million of net proceeds from the issuance of preferred securities in january 2016.  retained operating cash flow represents our expected cash flow provided by operating activities, less shareholder distributions and capital expenditures to maintain real estate facilities.  our planned capital needs consist of (i) $267 million of remaining spend on our current development pipeline, (ii) $149 million in property acquisitions currently under contract and (iii) $29 million in principal repayments on existing debt.  our capital needs may increase significantly over the course of 2016; at our option we may redeem preferred
securities totaling $862.5 million, we expect to increase our development pipeline, and we expect additional property acquisition opportunities.
see liquidity and capital resources for further information regarding our capital requirements and anticipated sources of capital to fund such requirements.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $1,053.1 million or $6.07 per diluted common share, compared to $908.2 million or $5.25 in 2014 representing an increase of $144.9 million or $0.82 per diluted common share. the increase is primarily due to (i) a $165.8 million increase in self-storage net operating income and (ii) a $16.0 million increase in gains on sale of real estate, offset partially by (iii) a $22.1 million reduction in equity in earnings of psb due primarily to reduced gains on disposition in 2015 as compared to 2014 and (iv) a $15.6 million reduction in equity in earnings of shurgard europe due primarily to shurgard europe's repayment of a loan payable to us.    the $165.8 million increase in self-storage net operating income is a result of a $114.1 million increase in our same store facilities and a $51.7 million increase in our non same store facilities.  revenues for the same store facilities increased 6.5% or $121.2 million in the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot.  cost of operations for the same store facilities increased by 1.4% or $7.1 million in the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, due primarily to increases in snow removal and property taxes, offset partially by lower advertising and selling expenses.  the increase in net operating income for the non same store facilities is due primarily to the impact of the development and acquisition of 202 self-storage facilities since january 2013.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $908.2 million or $5.25 per diluted common share, compared to $844.7 million or $4.89 per diluted common share for the same period in 2013, representing an increase of $63.5 million or $0.36 per diluted common share.  this increase is due primarily to (i) a $157.2 million increase in self-storage net operating income and (ii) our $36.5 million equity share of psb's gain on sale of real estate included in our equity in earnings of real estate entities, offset partially by (iii) a $49.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense associated with acquired facilities, (iv) a $24.1 million reduction associated with foreign currency exchange gains and losses, (v) a $28.3 million increase in earnings allocated to preferred shareholders due to the issuance of additional preferred shares, and (vi) a $16.3 million decrease in interest and other income due primarily to the disposition of 51% of our loan receivable from shurgard europe.
the $157.2 million increase in our self-storage net operating income is a result of an $86.8 million increase for our same store facilities and a $70.4 million increase for our non-same store facilities.   revenues for the same store facilities increased 5.5% or $96.1 million in the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot.  cost of operations for the same store facilities increased by 1.9% or $9.3 million in the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013, due primarily to increases in property tax expense and snow removal costs, offset partially by lower on-site property manager payroll expense.  the increase in net operating income for the non-same store facilities is due primarily to the impact of the acquisition and development of 172 facilities in 2013 and 2014.
funds from operations and core funds from operations funds from operations ("ffo") and ffo per share are non-gaap measures defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts and are considered helpful measures of reit performance by reits and many reit analysts.  ffo represents net income before real estate depreciation, gains and losses, and impairment charges, which are excluded because they are based upon historical real estate costs and assume that building values diminish ratably over time, while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions.  ffo and ffo per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share.  ffo is not a substitute for gaap net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows.  in addition, other reits may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among reits may not be helpful.

we also present "core ffo per share," a non-gaap measure that represents ffo per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses, including amounts included in equity earnings, (ii) eitf d-42 charges related to the redemption of preferred securities, (iii) property acquisition costs incurred and (iv) certain other items.  we believe core ffo per share is a helpful measure used by investors and reit analysts to understand our performance.  however, core ffo per share is not a substitute for net income per share.  because other reits may not compute core ffo per share in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology, or may not present such a measure, core ffo per share may not be comparable among reits.

(a)   we believe net operating income or "noi" is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize noi in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, determining current property values, evaluating property performance and in comparing period-to-period and market-to-market property operating results. in addition, we believe the investment community utilizes noi in determining operating performance and real estate values, and does not consider depreciation expense because it is based upon historical cost. noi is not a substitute for net income, net operating cash flow, or other related gaap financial measures, in evaluating our operating results. see note 11 to our december 31, 2015 financial statements for a reconciliation of noi to our total net income for all periods presented.
net operating income from our self-storage operations has increased 11.2% in 2015 as compared to 2014 and 11.9% in 2014 as compared to 2013.  these increases are due to higher revenues offset in part by modest expense growth in our same store facilities, the acquisition of new facilities, and the fill-up of unstabilized facilities.
same store facilities the same store facilities represent those facilities that have been owned and operated on a stabilized basis since january 1, 2013 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2013, 2014 and 2015.  the following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 1,990 facilities (126.3 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 86% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our u.s. consolidated self-storage portfolio at december 31, 2015.

(a)   revenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sale revenues and expenses generated at the facilities.
(b)   realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. realized annual rent per available square foot ("revpaf") is computed by dividing rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the total available net rentable square feet for the period. these measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency, and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. in addition, the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. these measures take into consideration promotional discounts, which reduce rental income.
analysis of same store revenue revenues generated by our same store facilities increased by 6.5% in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to a 6.1% increase in realized annual rental income per occupied square foot.  revenues generated by our same store facilities increased by 5.5% in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to a 4.9% increase in realized annual rental income per occupied square foot.  the increase in realized annual rental income per occupied square foot were due primarily to annual rent increases given to existing tenants and, to a lesser extent, increased move-in rental rates.
same store weighted average square foot occupancy increased from 93.9% in 2014 to 94.5% in 2015, representing an increase of 0.6%.  same store weighted average square foot occupancy increased from 93.3% in 2013 to 93.9% in 2014, representing an increase of 0.6%.  at december 31, 2015, the year-over-year occupancy gap was 0.3%.  we expect the year over year occupancy gap to narrow because we believe we are reaching limitations to occupancy levels inherent with approximately 5% to 7% of our tenant base vacating each month without notice.
during 2015, 2014 and 2013, the average annualized contractual rates per occupied square foot for tenants that moved in were $14.45, $13.67 and $13.04, respectively, and for tenants that vacated were $15.08, $14.38 and $13.83, respectively.  realized annual rental income per occupied square foot has increased in 2015 and 2014, despite average move-in rates for tenants moving in being generally less than average rates for tenants that vacate, due primarily to rate increases to existing tenants.
we believe that the current trends in move-in, move-out, in place contractual rents and occupancy levels are consistent with our expectation of continued revenue growth in 2016.  however, such trends, when viewed in the short-run, are volatile and not necessarily predictive of our revenues going forward because they are subject to many short-term factors.  such factors include initial move-in rates, seasonal factors, the unit size and geographical mix of the specific tenants moving in or moving out, the length of stay of the tenants moving in or moving out, changes in our pricing strategies, and the degree and timing of rate increases previously passed to existing tenants.
on-site property manager payroll expense increased 0.6% in 2015 as compared to 2014 and decreased 1.8% in 2014 as compared to 2013.  the increase in 2015 was due primarily to higher health care expenses, offset partially by reduced workers compensation costs.  the decrease in 2014 was due primarily to efficiencies which resulted in fewer hours worked, combined with reduced workers' compensation expenses.  we expect on-site property manager payroll expense to increase modestly in 2016 due to inflationary wage increases.
supervisory payroll expense, which represents compensation paid to the management personnel who directly and indirectly supervise the on-site property managers, increased 1.9% in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to higher wage rates, and decreased 1.5% in 2014 as compared to 2013, due primarily to reduced headcount.  we expect inflationary increases in compensation rates in 2016.
repairs and maintenance expense levels are dependent upon many factors such as weather conditions, which can impact repair and maintenance needs including snow removal, inflation in material and labor costs, and random events.  we expect inflationary increases in repairs and maintenance expense in 2016, excluding snow removal expense, which is primarily weather dependent and not predictable.
our utility expenses are comprised primarily of electricity costs, which are dependent upon energy prices and usage levels.  changes in usage levels are driven primarily by weather and temperature.  utility expense decreased 2.6% in 2015 as compared to 2014, and increased 4.2% in 2014 as compared to 2013.  it is difficult to estimate future utility costs, because weather, temperature, and energy prices are volatile and not predictable.  however, based upon current trends and expectations regarding commercial electricity rates, we expect inflationary increases in rates.
other direct property costs include administrative expenses incurred at the self-storage facilities, such as property insurance, business license costs, bank charges related to processing the facilities' cash receipts, credit card fees, and the cost of operating each property's rental office including supplies and telephone data communication lines.  these costs increased 2.2% in 2015 as compared to 2014, as well as in 2014 as compared to 2013.  the increases were due primarily to higher credit card fees, offset partially by lower property insurance costs.  credit card fees increased due to a higher proportion of collections being received from credit cards and higher revenues.  we expect moderate increases in other direct property costs in 2016.
analysis of same store depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization for same store facilities decreased 0.2% during 2015 as compared to 2014 and 0.8% during 2014 as compared to 2013.  we expect depreciation to be flat in 2016 as compared to 2015.

we believe that our geographic diversification and scale provide some insulation from localized economic effects and add to the stability of our cash flows.  it is difficult to predict localized trends in short-term self-storage demand and operating results.  over the long run, we believe that markets that experience population growth, high employment, and otherwise exhibit economic strength and consistency will outperform markets that do not exhibit these characteristics.
non same store facilities the non same store facilities at december 31, 2015 represent 276 facilities that were not stabilized with respect to occupancies or rental rates since january 1, 2013, or that we did not own as of january 1, 2013.  as a result of the stabilization process and timing of when the facilities were acquired, year-over-year changes can be significant.

other facilities                                    8,217                   7,029                1,188                   7,029                  5,904                  1,125
the facilities included above under "2015 acquisitions," "2014 acquisitions" and "2013 acquisitions," were acquired at a cost of $168.8 million, $430.7 million, and $1.16 billion, respectively.
for 2015, the weighted average annualized yield on cost, based upon net operating income, for the facilities acquired in each of 2014 and 2013 was 6.9% and 6.7%, respectively.  the yields for the facilities acquired in 2015 were not meaningful due to our limited ownership period.
we believe that our management and operating infrastructure allows us to generate higher net operating income from newly acquired facilities than was achieved by the previous owners.  however, it can take 24 or more months for us to fully achieve the higher net operating income, and the ultimate levels of net operating income to be achieved can be affected by changes in general economic conditions.  as a result, there can be no assurance that we will achieve our expectations with respect to these newly acquired facilities.
since the beginning of 2013, we have opened development and expansion projects with a total cost of $307 million.  these expanded and newly developed facilities are included in "other facilities" in the table above.  we believe that our real estate development activities are beneficial to our business operations over the long run.  however, in the short run, due to the three to four year period that it takes to fill up newly developed storage space and reach a stabilized level of cash flows, our earnings are diluted because of an increasing level of development and unstabilized properties in our portfolio.
we expect the non same store facilities to continue to provide increased net operating income in 2016 as these facilities approach stabilized occupancy levels and the earnings of the 2015 acquisitions are reflected in our operations for a longer period in 2016 as compared to 2015.
we also expect to increase the number of non same store facilities over at least the next 24 months through development of new self-storage facilities, expansions to existing facilities and acquisitions of facilities.
as of december 31, 2015, we had development and expansion projects which will add approximately 3.7 million net rentable square feet of storage space at a total cost of approximately $486 million.  a total of $219 million of these costs were incurred through december 31, 2015, with the remaining costs expected to be incurred primarily in 2016.  some of these projects are subject to significant contingencies such as entitlement approval.  we expect to continue to seek additional development projects; however, the level of future development may be limited due to various constraints such as difficulty in finding projects that meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations and challenges in obtaining building permits for self-storage activities in certain municipalities.  we believe that the resulting dilution from our development activities will also grow in 2016 and beyond.
subsequent to december 31, 2015, we acquired or were under contract to acquire 17 self-storage facilities (seven in florida, eight in ohio, and one each in tennessee and south carolina) with 1.2 million net rentable square feet for $149 million. we will continue to seek to acquire facilities in 2016; however, there is significant competition to acquire existing facilities and there can be no assurance we will continue to be successful.
depreciation and amortization with respect to the non same store facilities decreased $10.5 million during 2015 as compared to 2014, and increased $52.5 million in 2014 as compared to 2013.  included in depreciation and amortization for 2015, 2014, and 2013 is $26.1 million, $48.4 million, and $24.1 million, respectively in amortization of intangible assets.  intangible assets represent the value of the tenants in place at the time the facilities are acquired and are amortized relative to the benefit of the tenants to each period.  the decrease in 2015 was due primarily to reduced tenant intangible amortization, while the increase in 2014 includes increased intangible amortization and increased building depreciation.  based upon the facilities we own at december 31, 2015, amortization expense with respect to such intangibles is estimated at $9.7 million for 2016.  the level of future depreciation and amortization will also depend upon the level of acquisitions of facilities, as well as the level of newly developed storage space.
ancillary operations ancillary revenues and expenses include amounts associated with the reinsurance of policies against losses to goods stored by tenants in our self-storage facilities in the u.s. and the sale of merchandise at our self-storage facilities.  the following table sets forth our ancillary operations:
tenant reinsurance operations: our tenants have the option of purchasing insurance from a non-affiliated insurance company to cover certain losses to their goods stored at our facilities.  a wholly-owned, consolidated subsidiary of public storage fully reinsures such policies, assuming all risk of losses under these policies.  the subsidiary received reinsurance premiums substantially equal to the premiums collected from our tenants by the non-affiliated insurance company.  such reinsurance premiums are shown as "tenant reinsurance premiums" in the above table.
the subsidiary pays a fee to public storage to assist with the administration of the program and allow the insurance to be marketed to our customers.  such fees represent a substantial amount of the reinsurance premiums received by our subsidiary.  these fees are eliminated in consolidation and are therefore not shown in the above table.
tenant reinsurance revenue increased from $84.9 million in 2013, to $95.1 million in 2014, and to $109.8 million in 2015, due to (i) increased average premiums per insured tenant resulting from higher average policy limits, (ii) a higher proportion of tenants having insurance, and (iii) a larger number of potential insurance customers due to higher occupancies and newly acquired facilities in 2014 and 2015.
cost of operations primarily includes claims paid that are not covered by our outside third-party insurers, as well as claims adjustment expenses.  tenant reinsurance cost of operations increased from $17.1 million in 2013, to $25.6 million in 2014, and to $26.0 million in 2015.  tenant reinsurance cost of operations for 2014 includes a $7.8 million accrual related to a legal settlement and a $4.1 million reduction associated with the recognition of a deferred tax asset.  the increase of $4.1 million in ongoing cost of operations for 2015 as compared to 2014 is due primarily to an increase in exposure associated with more
insured tenants and losses incurred in connection with flooding in the houston and south carolina markets in the last six months of 2015.  the increase of $4.9 million in ongoing cost of operations for 2014 as compared to 2013 is due primarily to an increase in exposure associated with more insured tenants and, to a lesser extent, claims resulting from extreme weather conditions in early 2014.
merchandise sales: we sell locks, boxes, and packing supplies at our self-storage facilities, and the level of sales of these items is primarily impacted by the level of move-ins and other customer traffic at our self-storage facilities.  we do not expect any significant changes in revenues or profitability from our merchandise sales in 2016.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities at december 31, 2015, we have equity investments in psb, shurgard europe and various limited partnerships.  we account for such investments using the equity method and record our pro-rata share of the net income of these entities for each period.  the following table, and the discussion below, sets forth the significant components of our equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities:
equity in earnings:
total equity in earnings            $50,937             $88,267        $(37,330)                  $88,267             $57,579        $30,688
investment in psb: at december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had approximately a 42% common equity interest in psb, comprised of our ownership of 7,158,354 shares of psb's common stock and 7,305,355 limited partnership units in an operating partnership controlled by psb.  the limited partnership units are convertible at our option, subject to certain conditions, on a one-for-one basis into psb common stock.
equity in earnings from psb decreased to $34.2 million for 2015 as compared to $56.3 million for 2014, due primarily to a $25.2 million reduction in our equity share of psb's gains on disposal.  equity in earnings from psb increased to $56.3 million for 2014 as compared to $23.2 million for 2013, due primarily to our $36.5 million equity share of psb's gain on sale of real estate in 2014.  see note 4 to our december 31, 2015 financial statements for selected financial information on psb, as well as psb's filings and selected financial information that can be accessed through the sec, and on psb's website, www.psbusinessparks.com.
investment in shurgard europe: we have a 49% equity share in shurgard europe's net income.  at december 31, 2015, shurgard europe's operations are comprised of 216 wholly-owned facilities with 12 million net rentable square feet.  see note 4 to our december 31, 2015 financial statements for selected financial data on shurgard europe for 2015, 2014 and 2013.  as described in more detail in note 4, we receive trademark license fees from shurgard europe and, for certain periods, we received interest income from shurgard europe on a note payable to us.
in july 2014, shurgard europe completed the following financing transactions: (i) increased bank borrowings from €82.9 million to €125.0 million, and (ii) issued €300.0 million (issued in three equal tranches of 7, 10 and 12 year maturities) of unsecured senior notes with an average interest rate of 3.0%,
and (iii) fully repaid its €311.0 million shareholder loan.  as a result, we received a total of $204.9 million for our 49% share of the shareholder loan.
on december 31, 2014, shurgard europe acquired five facilities in germany (0.3 million net rentable square feet) for $90 million (€72 million) payable in march 2015.
on june 30, 2015, shurgard europe acquired 21 facilities in the netherlands (0.9 million net rentable square feet), for an aggregate of approximately $146 million (€132 million).
in june 2015, shurgard europe issued €300.0 million of unsecured senior notes with maturities in 10, 12 and 15 years and an average interest rate of 2.7%.  shurgard europe used a portion of these funds to acquire the netherland facilities noted above and to repay all credit facility borrowings.
our equity in earnings from shurgard europe decreased $15.6 million to $14.3 million for 2015 as compared to $29.9 million for 2014.  this decrease is due primarily to shurgard's july 2014 repayment of its shareholder loan.  this repayment eliminated $10.7 million in interest paid to us in 2014, which was classified as equity in earnings (see note 4 to our december 31, 2015 financial statements for further information).  the decrease also included our $2.7 million equity share of an increase in shurgard europe's income tax expense as well as a reduction of 16.5% in the average exchange rate between the u.s. dollar and the euro in 2015 as compared to 2014.
our equity in earnings from shurgard europe decreased to $29.9 million for 2014 as compared to $32.7 million for 2013.  the decrease is due primarily to our equity share of increased interest expense incurred in connection with shurgard europe's issuance of €300.0 million of debt in july 2014, costs associated with the facilities acquired in 2014, and a contingent loss incurred in 2014, offset partially by improved property operations.
for purposes of recording our equity in earnings from shurgard europe, the euro was translated into u.s. dollars based upon average exchange rates of 1.110 for 2015, 1.329 for 2014 and 1.328 for 2013.
shurgard europe had approximately €121 million in cash at december 31, 2015, with no investment prospects in the short-term for the funds.  accordingly, during the first three months of 2016, we expect to receive our 49% equity share of a €100 million dividend to be paid by shurgard europe.
our future earnings from shurgard europe will be affected primarily by the operating results of its existing facilities, as well as the exchange rate between the u.s. dollar and currencies in the countries in which shurgard europe conducts its business, principally the euro, as well as the impact of income taxes.
unlike our operations in the united states, shurgard europe operates as a taxable corporation in each of the countries in which it does business and incurs tax expense.  our equity share of such income tax expense has increased to approximately $5.3 million, $2.6 million, and $1.3 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  we expect continued increases in tax expense incurred by shurgard europe in 2016 and beyond, as its operations improve and its taxable income increases.
analysis of items not allocated to segments general and administrative expense: the following table sets forth our general and administrative expense:
development and acquisition costs               10,006              10,614               (608)             10,614              10,475                139
share-based compensation expense includes the amortization of restricted share units and stock options granted to employees, as well as related employer taxes.  the level of share-based compensation expense varies based upon the level of grants and forfeitures as well as the company's stock price on the date of grant.  the increase in share-based compensation costs in 2015 as compared to 2014 is due primarily to additional share-based grants and a higher average grant-date fair value per share.  we expect similar increases in share-based compensation in 2016 as was experienced in 2015.  see note 10 to our december 31, 2015 financial statements for further information on our share-based compensation.
development and acquisition costs represent internal and external expenses related to our acquisition and development activities and varies primarily based upon the level of development and acquisition activities undertaken.  during 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred incremental legal, transfer tax, and other related costs of approximately $1.3 million, $3.4 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in connection with the acquisition of self-storage facilities in each period.  the level of such costs to be incurred in 2016 will depend upon the level of acquisition activities, which is not determinable.  the amounts above are net of $8.1 million, $5.0 million, and $3.1 million in development costs that were capitalized in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, to newly developed and expanded self-storage facilities.  the remaining increase in each period is due to the expansion of our real estate development activities in recent years, and such expenses are expected to increase modestly in 2016.
tax compliance costs and taxes paid include taxes paid to various state and local authorities, the internal and external costs of filing tax returns, costs associated with complying with federal and state tax laws, and maintaining our compliance with internal revenue service reit rules.  such costs vary primarily based upon the tax rates of the various states in which we do business.
legal costs include internal personnel as well as fees paid to legal firms and other third parties with respect to general corporate legal matters and risk management, and varies based upon the level of litigation.  the increase of $13.3 million in legal costs in 2015 as compared to 2014 is due primarily to legal fees and expenses associated with certain litigated matters, as well as $3.5 million accrued in connection with the settlement of a legal matter.  the future level of legal costs is not determinable.
public company costs represent the incremental costs of operating as a publicly-traded company, such as internal and external investor relations expenses, stock listing and transfer agent fees, board of trustees' costs, and costs associated with maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including the dodd-frank act and sarbanes-oxley act.
other costs represent professional and consulting fees, payroll and overhead that are not directly attributable to our property operations.  such costs vary depending upon the level of corporate activities and initiatives and, as such, are not predictable.
interest and other income: interest and other income is comprised primarily of the net income from our commercial operations and property management operations.  amounts attributable to these activities totaled $12.0 million, $12.7 million and $11.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  we do not expect any significant changes in these activities in 2016.  for 2014 and 2013, interest and other income included $1.5 million and $19.3 million, respectively, in interest received on a loan receivable from shurgard europe which was extinguished in 2014, as described more fully in note 5 to our december 31, 2015 financial statements.
the remainder of our interest and other income is comprised primarily of interest earned on cash balances, trademark license fees received from shurgard europe, as well as sundry other income items that are received from time to time in varying amounts.  interest income on cash balances has been minimal, because rates have been at historic lows of 0.1% or less, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future.  future earnings from sundry other income items are not predictable.
interest expense: interest expense was $0.6 million, $6.8 million, and $6.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  during 2015, 2014 and 2013, we capitalized interest of $2.7 million, $1.6 million and $2.9 million, respectively, associated with our development activities.  interest expense incurred decreased in 2015, as compared to 2014, due to reduced outstanding debt.  during 2014 and 2013, we incurred $4.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively, in interest expense on short-term borrowings, all of which were repaid in 2014.  on november 3, 2015, we issued €242 million of euro-denominated senior unsecured notes (the "senior notes"), bearing interest at a fixed rate of 2.175% and maturing in 2025.  see note 6 to our december 31, 2015 financial statements for a schedule of our debt balances, principal repayment requirements and average interest rates at december 31, 2015.  future interest expense will be dependent upon the level of outstanding debt and the amount of in-process development costs.
gain on real estate sales: during each of 2015 and 2014, we sold various parcels of real estate primarily in connection with eminent domain proceedings recording gains on real estate sales totaling $18.5 million and $2.5 million, respectively.  during 2013, in connection with psb's common share issuance in 2013, we recognized a gain on sale of real estate totaling $4.1 million as if we had sold a proportionate share of our investment in psb.
liquidity and capital resources financial strategy: as a reit, we generally distribute 100% of our taxable income to our shareholders, which relative to a taxable c corporation, limits the amount of cash flow from operations that we can retain for investments.  as a result, in order to grow our asset base, access to capital is important.  historically we have primarily financed our cash investment activities with retained operating cash flow and net proceeds from the issuance of preferred securities.  due to market inefficiency, volatility, and limited capital market breadth for preferred securities, as well as our increased scale and potential capital needs, we are seeking to diversify our capital sources by establishing medium and long-term debt as an alternative; see "debt issuance" below.  over the long-term, we expect to continue to fund our capital requirements with retained operating cash flow, the issuance of medium or long term debt, and proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred securities.
common and preferred equity: we have historically been able to raise capital through the issuance of preferred securities at an attractive cost of capital, with rates between 5.200% and 6.375% since 2013, relative to the issuance of our common shares and, as a result, issuances of common shares have been minimal.  future issuances of common shares will depend upon the relative cost of capital for the issuance of our common equity.
we continue to view preferred equity as an important source of capital over the long-term.  on january 20, 2016, we issued 12.0 million depositary shares, each representing 1/1,000 of a share of our 5.40% series b preferred shares, at an issuance price of $25.00 per depositary share, for a total of $300.0 million in gross proceeds, and we incurred $9.9 million in issuance costs.
our credit ratings on each of our series of preferred shares are "a3" by moody's and "bbb+" by standard & poor's.  in recent years, we have been one of the largest and most frequent issuers of preferred equity in the u.s.
debt issuance: as noted above, we are seeking to position ourselves to issue medium and long-term debt in order to diversify our capital sources.  on november 3, 2015, we issued the senior notes to an institutional investor, and we expect to seek to issue additional medium or long-term debt in 2016 in order to establish a presence in the capital markets for our debt securities.
notwithstanding our expectation of increasing debt as a capital source, we expect to remain conservatively capitalized and not subject ourselves to significant refinancing risk from the issuance of debt.
we have broad powers to borrow in furtherance of our objectives without a vote of our shareholders.  these powers are subject to a limitation on unsecured borrowings in our bylaws described in "limitations on debt" below.  our senior debt has an "a" credit rating by standard and poor's and "a2" by moody's.  we believe this high rating, combined with our low level of debt, could allow us to issue a significant amount of unsecured debt at lower interest rates than the coupon rates on preferred securities if we chose to.
liquidity and capital resource analysis: we believe that our net cash provided by our operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to meet our ongoing requirements for operating expenses, capital improvements and distributions to our shareholders for the foreseeable future.
as of december 31, 2015, we have capital resources well in excess of our current planned capital needs over the next year totaling $445 million.  our capital resources include: (i) $104 million of cash as of december 31, 2015, (ii) $485 million of available borrowing capacity on our revolving line of credit, (iii) $250 million to $300 million of expected retained operating cash flow for the next twelve months, and (iv) $290 million of net proceeds from the issuance of preferred securities in january 2016.  retained operating cash flow represents our expected cash flow provided by operating activities, less shareholder distributions and capital expenditures to maintain real estate facilities.  our planned capital needs consist of
(i) $267 million of remaining spend on our current development pipeline, (ii) $149 million in property acquisitions currently under contract and (iii) $29 million in principal repayments on existing debt.  our capital needs may increase significantly over the course of 2016; at our option we may redeem preferred securities totaling $862.5 million, we expect to increase our development pipeline, and we expect additional property acquisition opportunities.
we believe we have a variety of possibilities to raise additional capital, if needed, to fund such future commitments including issuing common or preferred securities, issuing debt, or entering into joint venture arrangements to acquire or develop facilities.
required debt repayments: as of december 31, 2015, our outstanding debt totaled approximately $319.0 million, consisting of $55.1 million of secured debt and $263.9 million of unsecured debt.  approximate principal maturities are as follows (amounts in thousands):
the remaining maturities on our debt over at least the next five years are nominal compared to our expected annual cash from retained operating cash flow and we do not expect to refinance such debt with the issuance of new secured debt.
capital expenditure requirements: capital expenditures include major repairs or replacements to elements of our facilities to keep our facilities in good operating condition and maintain their visual appeal to the customer, which totaled $63.1 million in 2015.  capital expenditures do not include costs relating to the development of new facilities or the expansion of net rentable square footage of existing facilities.  for 2016, we expect to incur approximately $73 million for capital expenditures and to fund such amounts with cash provided by operating activities.  for the last four years, such capital expenditures have ranged between approximately $0.45 and $0.55 per net rentable square foot per year.
requirement to pay distributions: for all periods presented herein, we have elected to be treated as a reit, as defined in the code.  as a reit, we do not incur federal income tax on our reit taxable income (generally, net rents and gains from real property, dividends, and interest) that is fully distributed each year (for this purpose, certain distributions paid in a subsequent year may be considered), and if we meet certain organizational and operational rules.  we believe we have met these requirements in all periods presented herein, and we expect to continue to elect and qualify as a reit.  we believe that our net cash provided by our operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to meet our ongoing requirements for operating expenses, capital improvements and distributions to our shareholders for the foreseeable future.
distributions paid during 2015 totaled $1.371 billion, consisting of $245.1 million to preferred shareholders and $1.126 billion to common shareholders and restricted share unitholders.  all of these distributions were reit qualifying distributions.
we estimate the annual distribution requirements with respect to our preferred shares outstanding at december 31, 2015, including the series b preferred shares issued on january 20, 2016, to be approximately to be approximately $252 million per year.
future quarterly distributions with respect to the common shares will continue to be determined based upon our reit distribution requirements after taking into consideration distributions to the preferred shareholders and will be funded with cash provided by operating activities.
real estate investment activities: subsequent to december 31, 2015, we acquired or were under contract to acquire 17 self-storage facilities (seven in florida, eight in ohio, and one each in tennessee and south carolina) with 1.2 million net rentable square feet for $149 million. we will continue to seek to acquire properties; however, there is significant competition to acquire existing facilities and there can be no assurance as to the level of facilities we may acquire.
as of december 31, 2015, we had development and expansion projects which will add approximately 3.7 million net rentable square feet of storage space at a total cost of approximately $486 million.  a total of $219 million of these costs were incurred through december 31, 2015, with the remaining cost to complete of $267 million expected to be incurred primarily in 2016.  some of these projects are subject to significant contingencies such as entitlement approval.  we expect to continue to seek additional development projects; however, the level of future development may be limited due to various constraints such as difficulty in finding projects that meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations and challenges in obtaining building permits for self-storage activities in certain municipalities.
redemption of preferred securities: we have two series of preferred securities that become redeemable, at our option, during 2016; our 6.50% series q preferred shares, with $375 million outstanding, become redeemable in april 2016, and our 6.35% series r preferred shares, with $487.5 million outstanding, become redeemable in july 2016.  redemption of such preferred shares will depend upon many factors including whether we can issue capital at a lower cost of capital than the shares that would be redeemed.  none of our preferred securities are redeemable at the option of the holders.
repurchases of company's common shares: our board has authorized management to repurchase up to 35,000,000 of our common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  during 2015, we did not repurchase any of our common shares.  from the inception of the repurchase program through february 26, 2016, we have repurchased a total of 23,721,916 common shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $679.1 million.  we have no current plans to repurchase additional common shares; however, future levels of common share repurchases will be dependent upon our available capital, investment alternatives and the trading price of our common shares.
contractual obligations our significant contractual obligations at december 31, 2015 and their impact on our cash flows and liquidity are summarized below for the years ending december 31 (amounts in thousands):
construction commitments (4)            153,963              123,170             30,793                 -                 -                 -                 -
(1)amounts include principal and interest payments (all of which are fixed-rate) on our secured notes (the "mortgage notes") based on their contractual terms.  see note 6 to our december 31, 2015 financial statements for additional information on our notes payable.
(2)reflects the €242 million of euro-denominated senior unsecured notes (the "senior notes") we issued to an institutional investor on november 3, 2015, bearing interest at a fixed rate of 2.175% and maturing in ten years.
(3)we lease land, equipment and office space under various operating leases.  certain leases are cancelable; however, significant penalties would be incurred upon cancellation.  amounts reflected above consider continuance of the lease without cancellation.
(4)amounts exclude an additional $113.2 million in future expected development spending that was not under contract at december 31, 2015.
we estimate the annual distribution requirements with respect to our preferred shares outstanding at december 31, 2015, including the series b preferred shares issued on january 20, 2016, to be approximately to be approximately $252 million per year.  dividends are paid when and if declared by our board and accumulate if not paid.

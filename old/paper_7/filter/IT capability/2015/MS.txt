overview of financial results.
2015 compared with 2014.
   the company reported net revenues of $35,155 million in 2015, a 3% increase from net revenues of $34,275 million in 2014. the impact of debt valuation adjustment (dva) included in net revenues was positive $618 million and $651 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
                                                    net income applicable to morgan stanley for the current year was $6,127 million, or $2.90 per diluted common share, compared with $3,467 million, or
$1.60 per diluted common share, a year ago. the current year included net discrete tax benefits of $564 million, or $0.29 per diluted common share, compared with $2,226 million, or $1.13 per diluted common share, in the prior year. for a further discussion of these net discrete tax benefits, see supplemental financial information and disclosuresincome tax matters herein. the prior year also included litigation costs related to residential mortgage-backed securities and credit crisis matters of $3,083 million, or a loss of $1.47 per diluted common share, 2014 compensation actions of approximately $1,137 million (see also supplemental financial information and disclosuresdiscretionary incentive compensation herein), or a loss of $0.39 per diluted common share, and a funding valuation adjustment (fva) implementation charge of $468 million, or a loss of $0.17 per diluted common share.
                                                        excluding dva, net revenues were $34,537 million in 2015 compared with $33,624 million in 2014, and net income applicable to morgan stanley was

$2.41 per diluted common share, in 2015 compared with $823 million, or $0.26 per diluted common share, in 2014.
business segments.
   institutional securities net revenues of $17,953 million in 2015 increased 6% compared with $16,871 million in 2014, primarily as a result of higher sales and trading net revenues, partially offset by lower other revenues and lower revenues in investment banking.
   wealth management net revenues of $15,100 million in 2015 increased 1% from $14,888 million in 2014, primarily as a result of higher net interest income and asset management revenues, partially offset by lower transactional revenues.
   investment management net revenues of $2,315 million in 2015 decreased 15% from $2,712 million in 2014, primarily reflecting the reversal of previously accrued carried interest, reduction in revenues attributable to non-controlling interests and markdowns on principal investments.
                                                    compensation and benefits expenses of $16,016 million in 2015 were down 10% from $17,824 million in 2014, primarily due to the 2014 compensation actions, a decrease in 2015 in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments and carried interest, and a decrease in the level of discretionary incentive compensation in 2015 (see also supplemental financial information and disclosuresdiscretionary incentive compensation herein).
         non-compensation expenses were $10,644 million in 2015 compared with $12,860 million in 2014, representing a 17% decrease, primarily as a result of lower legal expenses in the institutional securities business segment associated with residential mortgage-backed securities and credit crisis-related matters.

                                                   the company reported net revenues of $34,275 million in 2014, a 5% increase compared with $32,493 million in 2013. net revenues in 2014 included positive revenues due to the impact of dva of $651 million compared with negative revenues of $681 million in 2013. in addition, net revenues in 2014 included a charge of approximately $468 million related to the implementation of fva (see
critical accounting policies herein and note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8), which was recorded in the institutional securities business segment.

business segments.
   institutional securities net revenues of $16,871 million in 2014 increased 9% compared with $15,519 million in 2013, primarily as a result of an increase in sales and trading net revenues and investment banking revenues, partially offset by lower net investment gains.
   wealth management net revenues of $14,888 million in 2014 increased 5% from $14,143 million in 2013, primarily as a result of higher asset management, distribution and administration fees and an increase in net interest income, partially offset by lower transactional revenues.
                                               investment management net revenues of $2,712 million in 2014 decreased 11% from $3,059 million in 2013. the decrease in net revenues was primarily related to lower net investment gains, including from investments in the companys employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans, and lower carried interest, partially offset by higher management and administration revenues.
   compensation and benefits expenses of $17,824 million in 2014 increased 10% from $16,277 million in 2013, primarily due to the 2014 compensation actions of approximately $1,137 million (see supplemental financial information and disclosuresdiscretionary incentive compensation herein).

dvadebt valuation adjustment represents the change in the fair value of certain of the companys long-term and short-term borrowings resulting from the fluctuation in its credit spreads and other credit factors.
(1)                                                  the institutional securities business segments net income applicable to noncontrolling interests was $133 million, $109 million and $278
million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the wealth management business segments net income applicable to noncontrolling interests was $221 million in 2013. the investment management business segments net income applicable to noncontrolling interests was $19 million, $91 million and $182 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further information.
(2)   pre-tax profit margin is a non-gaap financial measure that the company considers to be a useful measure to the company and investors to assess operating performance. percentages represent income from continuing operations before income taxes as a percentage of net revenues.
(3)                                                       the computation of average common equity for each business segment is determined using the companys required capital framework, an internal capital adequacy measure (see liquidity and capital resourcesregulatory requirementsrequired capital herein). the calculation of each business segments return on average common equity equals net income applicable to morgan stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of each business segments average common equity. the effective tax rates used in the computation of each business segments return on average common equity were determined on a separate legal entity basis. average common equity and the return on average common equity for each business segment are non-gaap financial measures that the company considers to be useful measures to the company and investors to assess capital adequacy and to allow better comparability of period-to-period operating performance, respectively.
(4)                                                        the calculation of return on average common equity equals consolidated net income applicable to morgan stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of average common equity. to determine the return on average common equity, excluding dva, and excluding dva and net discrete tax benefits, both the numerator and denominator were adjusted to exclude those items. average common equity, the return on average common equity, and average common equity and the return on average common equity, both excluding dva, and excluding dva and net discrete tax benefits, are non-gaap financial measures that the company considers useful for investors to assess capital adequacy and to allow better comparability of period-to-period operating performance.

(11)                                             the impact of dva on average common equity and average tangible common equity was $(637) million, $(1,108) million and $(1,057) million in 2015,
2014 and 2013, respectively. the impact of net discrete tax benefits on average common equity and average tangible common equity was approximately $434 million, $713 million and $146 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
(12)   the impact of dva on return on average common equity was 0.7%, 0.7% and (0.6)% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the impact of net discrete tax benefits on return on average common equity was 0.8%, 3.3% and 0.6% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
(13)                                                     the calculation of return on average tangible common equity equals net income applicable to morgan stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of average tangible common equity. to determine the return on average tangible common equity, excluding dva, and excluding dva and net discrete tax benefits, both the numerator and the denominator were adjusted to exclude the impact of dva and the impact of net discrete tax benefits. the impact of dva was 0.8%, 0.9% and (0.8)% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the impact of net discrete tax benefits was 0.9%, 3.9% and 0.8% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
(14)    tangible book value per common share equals tangible common equity of $58,098 million at december 31, 2015 and $55,138 million at december 31, 2014 divided by common shares outstanding of 1,920 million at december 31, 2015 and 1,951 million at december 31, 2014.
return on equity target.
the company is aiming to improve its returns to shareholders, and has established a target of achieving a 9% to 11% return on average common equity excluding dva (return on equity) by 2017, subject to the successful execution of its strategic objectives.
the company plans to progress toward achieving its return on equity target through the following key elements of its strategy:
   revenue and profitability growth:
   wealth management pre-tax margin improvement to approximately 23% to 25% through net interest income growth via continued high quality lending, expense efficiency and business growth;
   continued strength in investment banking and equity sales and trading results;
   steady performance in investment management;
   expense efficiency:
   achieve an expense efficiency target ratio excluding dva of 74%, assuming a flat revenue environment (not including any outsized litigation expense or penalties);
   sufficient capital:
   continuing to right-size the fixed income and commodities sales and trading business from an operational and capital standpoint; and
   increasing capital returns to shareholders, subject to regulatory approval.
the companys return on equity target and its related strategies, goals and targets are forward-looking statements that may be materially affected by many factors including, among other things: macroeconomic and market conditions; legislative and regulatory developments; industry trading and investment banking volumes; equity market levels; interest rate environment; legal expenses; capital levels; and discrete tax items. given the uncertainties surrounding these and other factors, there are significant risks that the companys return on equity target and its related strategies and targets may not be realized. actual results may differ from goals and targets, and the differences may be material and adverse. accordingly, the company cautions that undue reliance should not be placed on any of these forward-looking statements. see forward-looking statements immediately preceding part i, item 1, and risk factors in part i, item 1a, for additional information regarding these forward-looking statements.
return on equity, excluding dva, and pre-tax margin are non-gaap financial measures that the company considers to be useful measures to the companys investors to assess operating performance. the companys expense efficiency ratio, excluding dva, represents total non-interest expenses as a percentage of net revenues, excluding dva. for 2015, the companys expense efficiency ratio was 77%, which was calculated as non-interest expenses of $26,660 million divided by net revenues of $34,537 million, which excludes the positive impact of $618 million from dva. the expense efficiency ratio, excluding dva, is a non-gaap financial measure that the company considers useful for investors to assess operating performance.
global market and economic conditions.
during the first half of 2015, global growth was supported by a rebound in the u.s. and firmer growth in the euro zone and the united kingdom (u.k.) economies, partially offset by sluggishness in major emerging market economies. during the second half of 2015, global growth slowed as a result of the continued sluggishness of emerging market economies, declines
in energy prices and the slowdown of chinas economic growth. global real gross domestic product growth decelerated in 2015 from 2014. growth in emerging market economies slowed for a fourth straight year, while growth in developed market economies was steady but sluggish. notable trends during the year included falling oil and other commodity prices, an appreciating u.s. dollar weighing on global trade flows and increasing policy challenges in a number of major emerging market economies, most notably china. the u.s. board of governors of the federal reserve system (the federal reserve) announced a rate increase in december 2015 based on cumulative labor market progress and rising confidence in achieving its inflation target. however, with europe and japan still struggling and china decelerating, the european central bank, the bank of japan and the peoples bank of china acted to continue their targeted monetary policy easing measures. subsequent to december 31, 2015, the bank of japan announced a program of quantitative and qualitative monetary easing with a negative interest rate that introduced a three tier policy rate system for bank reserves with a low rate of (0.1)%.
business segments.
substantially all of the companys operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to its business segments. certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures.
as a result of treating certain intersegment transactions as transactions with external parties, the company includes an intersegment eliminations category to reconcile the business segment results to its consolidated results.
trading.    trading revenues include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments in which the company acts as a market maker as well as gains and losses on the companys related positions and other positions carried at fair value. trading revenues include the realized gains and losses from sales of cash instruments and derivative settlements, unrealized gains and losses from ongoing fair value changes of the companys positions related to market-making activities, and gains and losses related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans and other positions carried at fair value. in many markets, the realized and unrealized gains and losses from the purchase and sale transactions will include any spreads between bids and offers. certain fees received on loans carried at fair value and dividends from equity securities are also recorded in this line item since they relate to positions carried at fair value. commissions received for purchasing and selling listed equity securities and options are recorded separately in commissions and fees. other cash and derivative instruments typically do not have fees associated with them, and fees for related services are recorded in commissions and fees.
the company often invests in investments or other financial instruments to economically hedge its obligations under its deferred compensation plans. changes in the value of such investments are recorded in trading revenues and investments revenues. expenses associated with the related deferred compensation plans are recorded in compensation and benefits. compensation expense is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for upward and downward changes in fair value of the referenced investment, and is recognized ratably over the prescribed vesting period for the award. generally, changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in fair value of the referenced investment will be offset by changes in fair value of the investments made by the company. however, there may be a timing difference between the immediate revenue recognition of gains and losses on the companys investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period.
as a market maker, the company stands ready to buy, sell or otherwise transact with customers under a variety of market conditions and to provide firm or indicative prices in response to customer requests. the companys liquidity obligations can be explicit and obligatory in some cases, and in others, customers expect the company to be willing to transact with them. in order to most effectively fulfill its market-making function, the company engages in activities across all of its trading businesses that include, but are not limited to: (i) taking positions in anticipation of, and in response to, customer demand to buy or sell anddepending on the liquidity of the relevant market and the size of the positionto hold those positions for a period of time; (ii) managing and assuming basis risk (risk associated with imperfect hedging) between customized customer risks and the standardized products available in the market to hedge those risks; (iii) building, maintaining and rebalancing inventory, through trades with other market participants, and engaging in accumulation activities to accommodate anticipated customer demand; (iv) trading in the market to remain current on pricing and trends; and (v) engaging in other activities to
provide efficiency and liquidity for markets. although not included in trading revenues, interest income and expense are also impacted by market-making activities, as debt securities held by the company earn interest and securities are loaned, borrowed, sold with agreement to repurchase and purchased with agreement to resell.
investments.    the companys investments generally are held for long-term appreciation, or as discussed above, hedging purposes, and generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. estimates of the fair value of the investments may involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions. in some cases, such investments are required or are a necessary part of offering other products. the revenues recorded are the result of realized gains and losses from sales and unrealized gains and losses from ongoing fair value changes of the companys holdings, as well as from investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation and co-investment plans. typically, there are no fee revenues from these investments. the sales restrictions on the investments relate primarily to redemption and withdrawal restrictions on investments in real estate funds, hedge funds and private equity funds, which include investments made in connection with certain employee deferred compensation plans (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8). restrictions on interests in exchanges and clearinghouses generally include a requirement to hold those interests for the period of time that the company is clearing trades on that exchange or clearinghouse. additionally, there are certain investments related to assets held by consolidated real estate funds, which are primarily related to holders of noncontrolling interests.
commissions and fees.    commission and fee revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and over-the-counter (otc) equity securities, services related to sales and trading activities, and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options.
asset management, distribution and administration fees.    asset management, distribution and administration fees include fees associated with the management and supervision of assets, account services and administration, performance-based fees relating to certain funds, separately managed accounts, shareholder servicing and the distribution of certain open-ended mutual funds.
asset management, distribution and administration fees in the wealth management business segment also include revenues from individual and institutional investors electing a fee-based pricing arrangement and fees for investment management. mutual fund distribution fees in the wealth management business segment are based on either the average daily fund net asset balances or average daily aggregate net fund sales and are affected by changes in the overall level and mix of assets under management or supervision.
asset management fees in the investment management business segment arise from investment management services the company provides to investment vehicles pursuant to various contractual arrangements. the company receives fees primarily based upon mutual fund daily average net assets or based on monthly or quarterly invested equity for other vehicles. performance-based fees in the investment management business segment are earned on certain products as a percentage of appreciation earned by those products and, in certain cases, are based upon the achievement of performance criteria. these fees are normally earned annually and are recognized on a monthly or quarterly basis.
net interest.    interest income and interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including trading assets and trading liabilities; investment securities, which include available for sale (afs) securities and held to maturity (htm) securities; securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell; securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase; loans; deposits; other short-term borrowings; long-term borrowings; trading strategies; customer activity in the prime brokerage business; and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest rates.
institutional securities.    investment banking revenues are composed of fees from advisory services and revenues from the underwriting of securities offerings and syndication of loans, net of syndication expenses.
equity and fixed income and commodities sales and trading net revenues are composed of trading revenues; commissions and fees; asset management, distribution and administration fees; and net interest income (expense). in assessing the profitability of its sales and trading activities, the company views these net revenues in the aggregate. in addition, decisions
relating to trading are based on an overall review of aggregate revenues and costs associated with each transaction or series of transactions. this review includes, among other things, an assessment of the potential gain or loss associated with a transaction, including any associated commissions and fees, dividends, the interest income or expense associated with financing or hedging the companys positions, and other related expenses. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further information related to gains (losses) on derivative instruments.
in addition to sales and trading net revenues discussed above, sales and trading net revenues also include other trading revenues, consisting of costs related to liquidity held (negative carry), gains (losses) on economic hedges related to the long-term borrowings and certain activities associated with the corporate lending activities.
wealth management.    net revenues are composed of transactional, asset management, net interest and other revenues.
transactional revenues include investment banking, trading, and commissions and fees. investment banking revenues include revenues from the distribution of equity and fixed income securities, including initial public offerings, secondary offerings, closed-end funds and unit trusts. trading revenues include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments, in which the company acts as principal, gains and losses on the companys inventory positions, which are held primarily to facilitate customer transactions, and gains and losses associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans. revenues from commissions and fees primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and otc equity securities and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options.
asset management revenues include asset management, distribution and administration fees, and referral fees related to the bank deposit program.
net interest income includes interest related to the bank deposit program, interest on afs securities and htm securities, interest on lending activities and other net interest. interest income and interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities. net interest is driven by securities-based lending, mortgage lending, margin loans, securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions and bank deposit program activity.
other revenues include revenues from the sale of afs securities, customer account services fees and other miscellaneous revenues.
investment management.    the investment management business segment generates investment banking revenues primarily from the acquisition of investments in mature real estate and merchant banking funds. investments revenue primarily consists of real estate and private equity investments that generally are held for long-term appreciation and generally subject to sales restrictions. estimates of the fair value of the investments involve significant judgment and may fluctuate materially over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions.
for information about the composition of sales and trading, investment and asset management revenues, see net revenues herein.
compensation and benefits expense includes accruals for base salaries and fixed allowances, formulaic programs, discretionary incentive compensation, amortization of deferred cash and equity awards, changes in fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments, severance costs, and other items such as health and welfare benefits. the factors that drive compensation for the companys employees vary from quarter to quarter, segment to segment and within a segment. for certain revenue-producing employees in the wealth management and investment management business segments, their compensation is largely paid on the basis of formulaic payouts that link employee compensation to revenues. compensation for certain employees, including revenue-producing employees in the institutional securities business segment, may also include incentive compensation that is determined following the assessment of the company, business unit and individual performance. compensation for the companys remaining employees is largely fixed in nature (e.g., base salary, benefits, etc.).

2015 compared with 2014.
total sales and trading net revenues, excluding the impact of dva and the initial implementation of fva, of $11,832 million in 2015 increased 12% from the prior year due to higher equity, fixed income and commodities revenues.
equity.
                                         equity sales and trading net revenues, excluding the impact of dva and the implementation of fva, increased driven by strong results in prime brokerage and derivatives products. higher client balances primarily drove the increase in prime brokerage results, while the improved results in derivatives reflected increased client activity and gains on inventory.
fixed income and commodities.
   excluding the impact of dva and the implementation of fva, fixed income and commodities sales and trading net revenues increased as higher commodity net revenues were partially offset by lower fixed income product results.
                         fixed income product net revenues, excluding the impact of dva and the implementation of fva, decreased due to lower results in credit and securitized products from wider credit spread environment which were partially offset by higher revenues in interest rates and foreign exchange products from higher client activity.
                                                 commodity net revenues, excluding the impact of dva and the implementation of fva, increased primarily reflecting higher revenues from the global oil merchanting business, which was sold on november 1, 2015 (see investments, other revenues, non-interest expenses, income tax items, dispositions and other items2015 compared with 2014dispositions herein). the increase was partially offset by credit driven losses and the absence of revenues from transmontaigne inc., which was sold on july 1, 2014 (see investments, other revenues, non-interest expenses, income tax items, dispositions and other items2014 compared with 2013dispositions herein).
2014 compared with 2013.
total sales and trading net revenues, excluding the impact of dva and the implementation of fva, of $10,561 million in 2014 increased 1% from the prior year due to higher equity and fixed income and commodities revenues partially offset by higher losses in other sales and trading net revenues.
equity.
                 equity sales and trading net revenues, excluding the impact of dva and the implementation of fva of $2 million, increased primarily due to higher revenues in the prime brokerage business driven by higher client balances partially offset by a decrease in derivatives revenues, reflecting unfavorable volatility movement.
fixed income and commodities.
                                            fixed income and commodities sales and trading net revenues in 2014 included a charge of $466 million related to the implementation of fva.
excluding the impact of dva and the implementation of fva, fixed income and commodities sales and trading net revenues increased as higher commodity net revenues were partially offset by lower fixed income product results.
   fixed income product net revenues, excluding the impact of dva and the implementation of fva, decreased as higher results in interest rate products were offset by declines in credit products, which reflected an unfavorable market environment.
                                   commodity net revenues, excluding the impact of dva and the implementation of fva, increased reflecting higher levels of client demand for structured transactions and volatility in natural gas and power partly offset by lower revenues in the oil related businesses in part attributable to transmontaigne inc., which was sold on july 1, 2014

2015 compared with 2014.
investments.
   net investment gains of $274 million in 2015 increased 14% from the prior year driven by gains on business related investments.
          other revenues of $221 million in 2015 decreased 68% from the prior year primarily due to the absence of gains realized on certain assets sold in
2014 (see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8) and markdowns and provisions on loans held for sale and held for investment, respectively.
non-interest expenses of $13,282 million in 2015 decreased 22% from the prior year driven by a 25% reduction in non-compensation expenses and a 17% reduction in compensation and benefits expenses.
                                     compensation and benefits expenses decreased primarily due to the 2014 compensation actions, a decrease in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments, and a decrease in the level of discretionary incentive compensation in 2015 (see also supplemental financial information and disclosuresdiscretionary incentive compensation herein).
   non-compensation expenses decreased primarily due to lower litigation expenses.
income tax items.
in 2015, the company recognized in provision for (benefit from) income taxes net discrete tax benefits of $564 million. these net discrete tax benefits were primarily associated with the repatriation of non-u.s. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated due to an internal restructuring to simplify the companys legal entity organization in the u.k.
dispositions.
on november 1, 2015, the company completed the sale of its global oil merchanting unit of the commodities division to castleton commodities international llc. the loss on sale of approximately $71 million was recognized in other revenues.
2014 compared with 2013.
investments.
             net investment gains of $240 million in 2014 decreased 66% from the prior year reflecting a gain recorded in 2013 related to the disposition of an investment in an insurance broker, and lower gains on principal investments and investments associated with the deferred compensation and co-investment plans in 2014.
                       other revenues of $684 million remained unchanged. the results in 2014 included lower income from the companys 40% stake in mitsubishi ufj morgan stanley securities co., ltd.

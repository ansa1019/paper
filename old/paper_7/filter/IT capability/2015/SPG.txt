item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included in this annual report on form 10-k.
overview simon property group, inc., simon or the company, is a delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or reit, under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or the internal revenue code. reits will generally not be liable for federal corporate income taxes as long as they distribute not less than 100% of their reit taxable income. simon property group, l.p., or the operating partnership, is our majority-owned partnership subsidiary that owns all of our real estate properties and other assets. in this discussion, the terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to simon, the operating partnership, and its subsidiaries.
we own, develop and manage retail real estate properties, which consist primarily of malls, premium outlets®, and the mills®. as of december 31, 2015, we owned or held an interest in 209 income-producing properties in the united states, which consisted of 108 malls, 71 premium outlets, 14 mills, four lifestyle centers, and 12 other retail properties in 37 states and puerto rico. we opened four outlets in 2015 and have three outlets and two other significant retail projects under development. in addition, we have redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of anchors, big box tenants, and restaurants, underway at 29 properties in the u.s. and europe. internationally, as of december 31, 2015, we had ownership interests in nine premium outlets in japan, three premium outlets in south korea, two premium outlets in canada, one premium outlet in mexico, and one premium outlet in malaysia. as of december 31, 2015, we had a noncontrolling ownership interest in a joint venture that holds five outlet properties in europe and one outlet property in canada. of the five properties in europe, two are located in italy and one each is located in austria, the netherlands, and the united kingdom. additionally, as of december 31, 2015, we owned a 20.3% equity stake in klépierre sa, or klépierre, a publicly traded, paris-based real estate company, which owns, or has an interest in, shopping centers located in 16 countries in europe.
we generate the majority of our revenues from leases with retail tenants including:
 recoverable expenditures such as property operating, real estate taxes, repair and maintenance, and advertising and promotional expenditures.
we invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation. we seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, or ffo, and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments. we seek to accomplish this growth through the following:
 attracting and retaining high quality tenants and utilizing economies of scale to reduce operating expenses,
 expanding and re-tenanting existing highly productive locations at competitive rental rates,
 selectively acquiring or increasing our interests in high quality real estate assets or portfolios of assets,
 generating consumer traffic in our retail properties through marketing initiatives and strategic corporate alliances, and
we also grow by generating supplemental revenue from the following activities:
 establishing our malls as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and consumer-focused corporate alliances, including payment systems (such as handling fees relating to the sales of bank-issued prepaid cards), national marketing alliances, static and digital media initiatives, business development, sponsorship, and events,
 offering property operating services to our tenants and others, including waste handling and facility services, and the provision of energy services,
 generating interest income on cash deposits and investments in loans, including those made to related entities.
we focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum. we expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our risk-reward criteria. we selectively develop new properties in markets we believe are not adequately served by existing retail outlet properties.
we routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio. our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk.
to support our growth, we employ a three-fold capital strategy:
 provide the capital necessary to fund growth,
 maintain sufficient flexibility to access capital in many forms, both public and private, and
 manage our overall financial structure in a fashion that preserves our investment grade credit ratings.
we consider ffo, net operating income, or noi, and comparable property noi (noi for properties owned and operated in both periods under comparison) to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, or gaap. we use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies. reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure are included below in this discussion.
 improved operating performance and core business fundamentals in 2015 and the impact of our acquisition and expansion activity,
 increased consolidated lease settlement activity of $25.9 million, or $0.07 per diluted share,
 a 2015 gain of $80.2 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, from the sale of marketable securities, and
 a 2015 gain on acquisitions and disposals of $250.5 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, related to a non-cash gain on klépierre's acquisition of corio n.v., or corio, of $206.9 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, and gains of $43.6 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, due to the disposition of our interests in three unconsolidated properties,
 a 2014 gain on acquisitions and disposals of $158.3 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, primarily related to klépierre's sale of a portfolio of 126 retail galleries of which our share of the gain was $133.9 million, or $0.37 per diluted share.
core business fundamentals improved during 2015, primarily driven by higher tenant sales and strong leasing activity. portfolio noi grew by 7.1% in 2015 as compared to 2014. comparable property noi also grew 3.7% for our portfolio of u.s. malls, premium outlets, and the mills. total sales per square foot, or psf, increased 0.1% from $619 psf at december 31, 2014, to $620 psf at december 31, 2015, for our u.s. malls and premium outlets. average base minimum rent for u.s. malls and premium outlets increased 4.1% to $48.96 psf as of december 31, 2015, from $47.01 psf as of december 31, 2014. releasing spreads remained positive in our u.s. malls and premium outlets as we were able to lease available square feet at higher rents than the expiring rental rates on the same space, resulting in a releasing spread (based on total tenant payments  base minimum rent plus common area maintenance) of $10.62 psf ($69.64 openings compared to $59.02 closings) as of december 31, 2015, representing a 18.0% increase over expiring payments. ending occupancy for our u.s. malls and premium outlets was 96.1% as of december 31, 2015, as compared to 97.1% as of december 31, 2014, a decrease of 100 basis points primarily as a result of tenant bankruptcy activity announced in the first quarter of 2015.
our effective overall borrowing rate at december 31, 2015 on our consolidated indebtedness decreased 53 basis points to 3.88% as compared to 4.41% at december 31, 2014. this reduction was primarily due to a decrease in the effective overall borrowing rate on fixed rate debt of 51 basis points (4.12% at december 31, 2015 as compared to 4.63% at december 31, 2014). at december 31, 2015, the weighted average years to maturity of our consolidated indebtedness was 5.9 years as compared to 6.2 years at december 31, 2014.
our financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2015, included:
 acquiring two properties  jersey gardens in elizabeth, new jersey (renamed the mills at jersey gardens) and university park village in fort worth, texas, subject to existing fixed-rate mortgage loans of $350.0 million and $55.0 million, respectively, which mature on november 1, 2020 and may 1, 2028 and bear interest of 3.83% and 3.85%, respectively.
 issuing $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 2.50% with a maturity date of september 1,
2020 and $600.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 3.50% with a maturity date of september 1, 2025 on august 17, 2015.
 redeeming at par or repaying at maturity $693.5 million of senior unsecured notes with fixed interest rates ranging from 5.10%
 completing the early redemption of two series of senior unsecured notes comprising $1.0 billion with fixed interest rates of 6.13% and 7.38%. we recorded a $121.0 million loss on extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of the early redemption.
 issuing €750.0 million ($798.3 million u.s. dollar equivalent) of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 1.38% with a maturity date of november 18, 2022.
 increasing our borrowings of $815.0 million on our $4.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, or credit facility, which we used to partially fund the early redemption of senior unsecured notes on december 21, 2015; we repaid these credit facility borrowings in full on january 14, 2016 with proceeds from a january 13, 2016 unsecured notes issuance.
united states portfolio data the portfolio data discussed in this overview includes the following key operating statistics: ending occupancy, average base minimum rent per square foot, and total sales per square foot for our domestic assets. we include acquired properties in this data beginning in the year of acquisition and remove disposed properties in the year of disposition. the washington prime properties have been removed from the portfolio data for all periods presented. for comparative purposes, we separate the information related to the mills from our other u.s. operations. we also do not include any properties located outside the united states.
 properties we account for under the equity method of accounting as joint ventures, and
total sales per square foot.    total sales include total reported retail tenant sales on a trailing 12-month basis at owned gla (for mall stores with less than 10,000 square feet) in the malls and the mills and stores with less than 20,000 square feet in the premium outlets. retail sales at owned gla affect revenue and profitability levels because sales determine the amount of minimum rent that can be charged, the percentage rent realized, and the recoverable expenses (common area maintenance, real estate taxes, etc.) that tenants can afford to pay.
current leasing activities during 2015, we signed 803 new leases and 1,594 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment, expansion, downsizing and relocation) with a fixed minimum rent across our u.s. malls and premium outlets portfolio, comprising approximately 7.5 million square feet, of which 5.8 million square feet related to consolidated properties. during 2014, we signed 773 new leases and 1,581 renewal leases with a fixed minimum rent,
comprising approximately 7.4 million square feet, of which 5.5 million square feet related to consolidated properties. the average annual initial base minimum rent for new leases was $55.24 per square foot in 2015 and $58.57 per square foot in 2014 with an average tenant allowance on new leases of $36.66 per square foot and $38.83 per square foot, respectively.
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. from time to time, we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions. in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. for a summary of our significant accounting policies, see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
 we, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases. we accrue minimum rents on a straight-line basis over the terms of their respective leases. substantially all of our retail tenants are also required to pay overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount during the lease year. we recognize overage rents only when each tenant's sales exceed its sales threshold.
 we review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable. these circumstances include, but are not limited to, a decline in a property's cash flows, occupancy or comparable sales per square foot. we measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization plus its residual value is less than the carrying value of the property. to the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value. we may decide to sell properties that are held for use and the sale prices of these properties may differ from their carrying values. we also review our investments, including investments in unconsolidated entities, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the fair value of the investments below carrying value is other-than-temporary. changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other investments could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results.
 to maintain our status as a reit, we must distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income in any given year and meet certain asset and income tests. we monitor our business and transactions that may potentially impact our reit status. in the unlikely event that we fail to maintain our reit status, and available relief provisions do not apply, we would be required to pay federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates during the period we did not qualify as a reit. if we lost our reit status, we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost unless our failure was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were met. as a result, failing to maintain reit status would result in a significant increase in the income tax expense recorded and paid during those periods.
 we make estimates as part of our valuation of the purchase price of acquisitions (including the components of excess investment in joint ventures) to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. the most significant components of our valuations are typically the determination of fair value to the buildings as-if-vacant, land and market value of in-place leases. in the case of the fair value of buildings and fair value of land and other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term. in the case of the market value of in-place leases, we make our best estimates of the tenants' ability to pay rents based upon the tenants' operating performance at the property, including the competitive position of the property in its market as well as sales psf, rents psf, and overall occupancy cost for the tenants in place at the acquisition date. our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in-place leases.
 a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties. after determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment.
the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. the capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon opening.
results of operations in addition to the activity discussed above in the "results overview" section, the following acquisitions, openings, and dispositions of consolidated properties affected our consolidated results from continuing operations in the comparative periods:
 on january 15, 2015, we acquired a 100% interest in jersey gardens (renamed the mills at jersey gardens) in elizabeth, new jersey and university park village in fort worth, texas, properties previously owned by glimcher realty trust.
 during 2013, we disposed of two malls, four community centers, and two retail properties.
in addition to the activities discussed above and in "results overview", the following acquisitions, dispositions, and openings of joint venture properties affected our income from unconsolidated entities in the comparative periods:
 during the third quarter of 2015, we closed on our previously announced joint venture with hudson's bay company, or hbc, whereby we currently have an 8.9% noncontrolling interest in a joint venture to which hbc contributed 42 of its properties in the u.s. later in the third quarter of 2015, the joint venture acquired an additional
41 properties in germany concurrently with hbc's acquisition of galeria holding, the parent company of germany's leading department store, kaufhof, as further discussed in note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. all of the joint venture's properties have been leased to affiliates of hbc.
 during the second quarter of 2015, we formed a joint venture with sears holdings, or sears, whereby we have a 50% noncontrolling interest in a joint venture in which sears contributed 10 of its properties located at our malls. seritage growth properties, or seritage, now holds sears' interest in the joint venture.
 on august 14, 2014, we and our partner opened twin cities premium outlets, a 409,000 square foot outlet center. we have a 35%
 on april 16, 2014, klépierre disposed of a portfolio of 126 properties located in france, spain, and italy.
 on april 10, 2014, through a european joint venture, we acquired an additional 22.5% noncontrolling interest in ashford designer outlet, increasing our ownership interest in this property to 45%.
 on october 16, 2013, through a european joint venture, we acquired noncontrolling interests in portions of four designer outlets, which include parndorf (vienna, austria), la reggia (naples, italy), noventa di piave (venice, italy), and roermond (roermond, netherlands).
 on april 19, 2013, we and our partner, mitsubishi estate co., ltd., opened shisui premium outlets, a 230,000
 a $80.2 million gain on the sale of marketable securities in the second quarter of 2015,
property operating expense increased $27.4 million, due to a $12.1 million increase related to the property transactions, and a $15.3 million increase in comparable property activity as a result of inflationary cost increases.
real estate taxes increased $48.7 million, of which the property transactions accounted for $15.3 million, with the remaining increase primarily caused by higher tax estimates in 2015.
during 2015, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $6.6 million whereas in the prior year the provision was $12.0 million, a reflection of the overall strong economic health of our tenants.
other expenses increased $11.2 million primarily due to an increase in legal costs and professional fees as well as acquisition-related costs in the first quarter of 2015, partially offset by a favorable net foreign currency revaluation impact on foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.
interest expense decreased $68.9 million primarily due to the net impact of our financing activities during 2015 and 2014 and the reduction in our effective overall borrowing rate as previously discussed.
income from unconsolidated entities increased $58.0 million primarily due to favorable results of operations and financing activity of joint venture properties as well as our acquisition and development activity.
during 2015, we disposed of our interests in three unconsolidated retail properties resulting in a gain of $43.6 million and we recorded a non-cash gain on klépierre's acquisition of corio of $206.9 million as discussed in note 3 of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. during 2014, we recorded a gain related to klépierre's sale of a portfolio of 126 properties and our disposal of three retail properties. additionally, in 2014, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in arizona mills from our joint venture partner. the property was previously accounted for under the equity method and we recognized a non-cash gain upon consolidation of this property. the aggregate gain recognized on these 2014 transactions was $158.3 million.
tenant reimbursements increased $104.2 million, due to a $14.8 million increase attributable to the property transactions and an $89.4 million, or 7.6%, increase in the comparable properties primarily due to utility reimbursements, annual fixed contractual increases related to common area maintenance, real estate tax recoveries and additional marketing recoveries related to costs incurred during our property rebranding initiative and increased digital and social media advertising costs.
total other income increased $32.7 million, principally as a result of a $16.1 million increase in lease settlement income, a $8.3 million increase attributable to dividend income and a $7.6 million increase in land sale activity.
property operating expense increased $27.6 million due to a $6.5 million increase related to the property transactions, and a $21.1 million increase related to the comparable properties primarily as a result of increased utility expenses partially due to the harsh winter.
depreciation and amortization expense increased $36.1 million primarily due to the additional depreciable assets related to the property transactions and our continued redevelopment and expansion activities.
advertising and promotion increased $18.8 million primarily related to costs incurred during our property rebranding initiative and increased digital and social media advertising costs.
provision for credit losses increased $4.8 million as a result of increased reserves due to an increase in tenant bankruptcies and a decrease in recoveries as compared to 2013. the 2014 expense is in line with longer term historical levels.
interest expense decreased $89.5 million primarily due to the net impact of our financing activities during 2014 and the reduction in the effective overall borrowing rate.
income from unconsolidated entities increased $20.4 million primarily due to favorable results from operations from the development and redevelopment of joint venture properties and 2013 results including an extinguishment charge related to the refinancing of aventura mall.
during 2014, we recorded a gain related to klépierre's sale of a portfolio of 126 properties and our disposal of three retail properties. additionally, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in arizona mills from our joint venture partner. the property was previously accounted for under the equity method and we recognized a non-cash gain upon consolidation of this property. the aggregate gain recognized on these transactions was $158.3 million. during 2013, we disposed of our interest in two malls, four community centers, and five retail properties and recorded a gain on the acquisition of an outlet center. the aggregate gain recognized on these transactions was approximately $93.4 million.
discontinued operations decreased $117.3 million due to 2014 including approximately five months of ownership of the washington prime properties, whereas 2013 included twelve full months of ownership of those properties. the 2013 results also included a $14.2 million gain on the disposal of three strip centers held within a joint venture portfolio of washington prime properties. additionally, on february 28, 2014 one strip center was sold by that same joint venture for a gain of $0.2 million. in 2014, we also incurred $38.2 million in transaction costs related to the washington prime spin-off.
liquidity and capital resources because we own long-lived income-producing assets, our financing strategy relies primarily on long-term fixed rate debt. floating rate debt comprised only 9.4% of our total consolidated debt at december 31, 2015. we also enter into interest rate protection agreements to manage our interest rate risk. we derive most of our liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities that totaled $3.8 billion in the aggregate during 2015. in addition, the credit facility, the operating partnership's $2.75 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility, or supplemental facility, and together with the credit facility, the credit facilities, and the commercial paper program provide alternative sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time. borrowing capacity under these sources may be increased as discussed further below.
on december 31, 2015, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of approximately $4.6 billion under the credit facility and the supplemental facility, net of outstanding borrowings of $1.2 billion, and amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program and letters of credit of $36.9 million. for the year ended december 31, 2015, the maximum amount outstanding under the two credit facilities was $1.8 billion and the weighted average amount outstanding was $1.2 billion. the weighted average interest rate was 0.79% for the year ended december 31, 2015. further, on october 6, 2014, the operating partnership entered into the global commercial paper program and on march 2, 2015, increased the maximum aggregate program size from $500.0 million to $1.0 billion as further discussed below.
we have historically had access to public equity and long and short-term unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private equity from institutional investors at the property level.
our business model and status as a reit require us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition, development and redevelopment activity, and to refinance maturing debt. we may also, from time to time, access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives. we believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the credit facility, the supplemental facility, and the commercial paper program to address our debt maturities and capital needs through 2016.
cash flows our net cash flow from operating activities and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities totaled $3.8 billion during 2015. in addition, we had net proceeds from our debt financing and repayment activities, including the $121.0 million debt extinguishment charge, of $1.2 billion in 2015. these activities are further discussed below under "financing and debt." during 2015, we also:
 funded the acquisition of two properties, acquired the land and existing structure anchored to one of our wholly owned properties, funded an additional equity stake in klépierre, funded the acquisition of our joint venture interest in ten assets that are adjacent to our existing properties, funded our portion of a joint venture development project, and funded the purchase of a noncontrolling interest in a joint venture, the aggregate cash portion of which was $1.4 billion,
 paid stockholder dividends and unitholder distributions totaling $2.2 billion,
 funded consolidated capital expenditures of $1.0 billion (including development and other costs of $138.8 million, redevelopment and expansion costs of $699.1 million, and tenant costs and other operational capital expenditures of $183.1 million),
 funded investments in unconsolidated entities of $329.9 million,
 funded the repurchase of our common stock and the purchase of limited partner units of $505.7 million, and
 received proceeds on the sale of marketable securities of $504.0 million.
in general, we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses, monthly debt service, recurring capital expenditures, and dividends to stockholders necessary to maintain our reit qualification on a long-term basis. in addition, we expect to be able to generate or obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures, such as acquisitions, major building redevelopments and expansions, as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness, from:
 excess cash generated from operating performance and working capital reserves,
 borrowings on our credit facilities and commercial paper program,
 additional secured or unsecured debt financing, or
 additional equity raised in the public or private markets.
we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2016, and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash. these cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our retail tenants. a significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds from the credit facilities and commercial paper program, curtail planned capital expenditures, or seek other additional sources of financing as discussed above.
financing and debt unsecured debt at december 31, 2015, our unsecured debt consisted of $13.5 billion of senior unsecured notes of the operating partnership, net of discounts, $1.2 billion outstanding under the credit facility, $240.0 million outstanding under an unsecured term loan, and $878.7 million outstanding under the operating partnership's commercial paper program. the december 31, 2015 balance on the credit facility included $237.8 million (u.s. dollar equivalent) of euro-denominated borrowings and $184.8 million (u.s. dollar equivalent) of yen-denominated borrowings. at december 31, 2015 the outstanding amount under the commercial paper program was $878.7 million, of which $188.1 million was related to the u.s. dollar equivalent of euro-denominated notes. foreign currency denominated borrowings under both the credit facility and commercial paper program are designated as net investment hedges of a portion of our international investments.
on december 31, 2015, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of $4.6 billion under the credit facility and the supplemental facility. the maximum aggregate outstanding balance under the two credit facilities during the year ended december 31, 2015 was $1.8 billion and the weighted average outstanding balance was $1.2 billion. letters of credit of $36.9 million were outstanding under the two credit facilities as of december 31, 2015.
the credit facility's initial borrowing capacity of $4.0 billion may be increased to $5.0 billion during its term and provides for borrowings denominated in u.s. dollars, euros, yen, sterling, canadian dollars and australian dollars. borrowings in currencies other than the u.s. dollar are limited to 75% of the maximum revolving credit amount, as defined. the initial maturity date of the credit facility is june 30, 2018 and can be extended for an additional year to june 30, 2019 at our sole option, subject to continued compliance with the terms thereof. the base interest rate on the credit facility is libor plus 80 basis points with an additional facility fee of 10 basis points.
on march 2, 2015, the operating partnership amended and extended the supplemental facility. the initial borrowing capacity of $2.0 billion has been increased to $2.75 billion, may be further increased to $3.5 billion during its term, will initially mature on june 30, 2019 and can be extended for an additional year to june 30, 2020 at our sole option, subject to our continued compliance with the terms thereof. the base interest rate on the amended supplemental facility was reduced to libor plus 80 basis points and the additional facility fee was reduced to 10 basis points. the supplemental facility provides for borrowings denominated in u.s. dollars, euros, yen, sterling, canadian dollars and australian dollars.
on march 2, 2015, the operating partnership increased the maximum aggregate program size of its commercial paper program from $500.0 million to $1.0 billion, or the non-u.s. dollar equivalent thereof. the operating partnership may issue unsecured commercial paper notes, denominated in u.s. dollars, euros and other currencies. notes issued in non-u.s. currencies may be issued by one or more subsidiaries of the operating partnership and are guaranteed by the operating partnership. notes are sold under customary terms in the u.s. and euro commercial paper note markets and rank (either by themselves or as a result of the guarantee described above) pari passu with the operating partnership's other unsecured senior indebtedness. the commercial paper program is supported by the credit facilities and if necessary or appropriate, we may make one or more draws under either of the credit facilities to pay amounts outstanding from time to time on the commercial paper program. at december 31, 2015, we had $878.7 million outstanding under the commercial paper program, comprised of $690.6 million outstanding in u.s. dollar denominated notes and $188.1 million (u.s. dollar equivalent) of euro denominated notes with weighted average interest rates of 0.43% and 0.03%, respectively. the borrowings mature on various dates from january 4, 2016 to april 18, 2016 and reduce amounts otherwise available under the credit facilities.
on august 17, 2015, the operating partnership issued $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 2.50% with a maturity date of september 1, 2020 and $600.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 3.50% with a maturity date of september 1, 2025. proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes.
on november 18, 2015, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the operating partnership issued €750.0 million ($798.3 million u.s. dollar equivalent) of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 1.38% with a maturity date of november 18, 2022. proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were used to pay down a portion of euro-denominated borrowings on the credit facility.
during 2015, we redeemed at par or repaid at maturity $693.5 million of senior unsecured notes with fixed interest rates ranging from 5.10% to 5.75% and completed the early redemption of two series of senior unsecured notes comprising $1.0 billion with fixed interest rates of 6.13% and 7.38%. we recorded a $121.0 million loss on extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of the early redemption. further, on february 1, 2016, we redeemed at par $163.3 million of senior unsecured notes with a fixed interest rate of 6.10%.
on january 13, 2016, the operating partnership issued $550.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 2.50% with a maturity date of july 15, 2021 and $800.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 3.30% with a maturity date of january 15, 2026. proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were used to pay down the credit facility, unencumber three assets and redeem senior unsecured notes at par in february 2016 and for general corporate purposes.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we repaid $259.3 million in mortgage loans, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.51%, unencumbering five properties.
on january 15, 2015, we acquired two properties  jersey gardens in elizabeth, new jersey (renamed the mills at jersey gardens) and university park village in fort worth, texas, subject to existing fixed-rate mortgage loans of $350.0 million and $55.0 million, respectively. the loans mature on november 1, 2020 and may 1, 2028 and bear interest at 3.83% and 3.85%, respectively.
covenants our unsecured debt agreements contain financial covenants and other non-financial covenants. if we were to fail to comply with these covenants, after the expiration of the applicable cure periods, the debt maturity could be accelerated or other remedies could be sought by the lender including adjustments to the applicable interest rate. as of december 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants of our unsecured debt.
at december 31, 2015, we or our subsidiaries were the borrowers under 44 non-recourse mortgage notes secured by mortgages on 49 properties, including four separate pools of cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized mortgages encumbering a total of 11 properties. under these cross-default provisions, a default under any mortgage included in the cross-defaulted pool may constitute a default under all mortgages within that pool and may lead to acceleration of the indebtedness due on each property within the pool. certain of our secured debt instruments contain financial and other non-financial covenants which are specific to the properties which serve as collateral for that debt. if the applicable borrower under these non-recourse mortgage notes fails to comply with these covenants, the lender could accelerate the debt and enforce its right against their collateral. at december 31, 2015, the applicable borrowers under these non-recourse mortgage notes were in compliance with all covenants where non-compliance could individually, or giving effect to applicable cross-default provisions in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

our off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in joint ventures which are common in the real estate industry and are described in note 7 to the notes to consolidated financial statements. our joint ventures typically fund their cash needs through secured debt financings obtained by and in the name of the joint venture entity. the joint venture debt is secured by a first mortgage, is without recourse to the joint venture partners, and does not represent a liability of the partners, except to the extent the partners or their affiliates expressly guarantee the joint venture debt. as of december 31, 2015, the operating partnership guaranteed joint venture related mortgage indebtedness of $353.7 million (of which we have a right of recovery from our venture partners of $112.8 million). mortgages guaranteed by us are secured by the property of the joint venture which could be sold in order to satisfy the outstanding obligation and which has an estimated fair value in excess of the guaranteed amount. we may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such fundings are not required contractually or otherwise.
acquisitions and dispositions buy-sell, marketing rights, and other exit mechanisms are common in real estate partnership agreements. most of our partners are institutional investors who have a history of direct investment in retail real estate. we and our partners in our joint venture properties may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up or similar restrictions). if we determine it is in our stockholders' best interests for us to purchase the joint venture interest and we believe we have adequate liquidity to execute the purchase without hindering our cash flows, then we may initiate these provisions or elect to buy our partner's interest. if we decide to sell any of our joint venture interests, we expect to use the net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness or to reinvest in development, redevelopment, or expansion opportunities.
acquisitions.    on january 15, 2015, we acquired a 100% interest in jersey gardens (renamed the mills at jersey gardens) in elizabeth, new jersey and university park village in fort worth, texas, properties previously owned by glimcher realty trust, for $677.9 million of cash and the assumption of existing mortgage debt of $405.0 million.
dispositions.    we continue to pursue the disposition of properties that no longer meet our strategic criteria or that are not a primary retail venue within their trade area.
joint venture formation activity on april 13, 2015, we announced a joint venture with sears, whereby sears contributed 10 of its properties located at our malls to the joint venture in exchange for a 50% noncontrolling interest in the joint venture. we contributed
$114.0 million in cash in exchange for a 50% noncontrolling interest in the joint venture. sears or its affiliates are leasing back each of the 10 properties from the joint venture. the joint venture has the right to recapture not less than 50% of the space leased to sears to be used for purposes of redeveloping and releasing the recaptured space. we will provide development, leasing and management services to the joint venture for any recaptured space. on july 7, 2015, we separately invested approximately $33.0 million in exchange for 1,125,760 common shares of seritage, a public reit recently formed by sears. seritage now holds sears' interest in the joint venture.
on july 22, 2015, we closed on our previously announced joint venture with hbc, to which hbc contributed 42 properties in the u.s. and we committed to contribute $100.0 million for improvements to the properties contributed by hbc in exchange for a noncontrolling interest in the newly formed joint venture. as of december 31, 2015, we have funded $1.0 million of this commitment. on september 30, 2015, hbc announced it had closed on the acquisition of galeria holding, the parent company of germany's leading department store, kaufhof. in conjunction with the closing, the joint venture acquired 41 kaufhof properties in germany from hbc. all of the joint venture's properties have been leased to affiliates of hbc. we contributed an additional $178.5 million to the joint venture upon closing of the galeria holding transaction. our noncontrolling interest in the joint venture is currently approximately 8.9%.
development activity new domestic developments, redevelopments and expansions.    during 2015, construction began on the following properties:
on april 23, 2015, we announced a partnership with swire properties inc. and whitman family development to jointly develop the approximately 500,000 square foot shopping center component of brickell city centre, a mixed-use development in downtown miami. we own a 25% interest in the retail component of this project, which is scheduled to open in september 2016. our share of the estimated cost of this project is approximately $110.0 million.
we routinely incur costs related to construction for significant redevelopment and expansion projects at our properties. redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of anchors and big box tenants, are underway at 27 properties in the u.s.
summary of capital expenditures.    the following table summarizes total capital expenditures on consolidated properties on a cash basis (in millions):
operational capital expenditures                                 92            79            75
capital expenditures on washington prime properties                           32            93
our share of the costs of all development and redevelopment projects currently under construction is approximately $2.1 billion. we expect to fund these capital projects with cash flows from operations. our estimated stabilized return on invested capital typically ranges between 8-12% for all of our new development, expansion and redevelopment projects.
international development activity.    we typically reinvest net cash flow from our international joint ventures to fund future international development activity. we believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies. we have also funded most of our foreign investments with local currency-denominated borrowings that act as a natural hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates. our consolidated net income exposure to changes in the volatility of the euro, yen, won, and other foreign currencies is not material. we expect our share of international development costs for 2016 will be approximately $160.0 million, primarily funded through reinvested joint venture cash flow and construction loans.

dividends and stock repurchase program common stock cash dividends during 2015 aggregated $6.05 per share. common stock cash dividends during 2014 aggregated $5.15 per share. in january 2016, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.60 per share of common stock payable on february 29, 2016 to stockholders of record on february 12, 2016. we must pay a minimum amount of dividends to maintain our status as a reit. our future dividends and future distributions of the operating partnership will be determined by our board of directors, in its sole discretion, based on actual and projected financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, cash available for dividends and limited partner distributions, cash reserves as deemed necessary for capital and operating expenditures, financing covenants, if any, and the amount required to maintain our status as a reit.
on april 2, 2015, our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock over a twenty-four month period as market conditions warrant. we may repurchase the shares in the open market or in privately

non-gaap financial measures industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on performance measures such as ffo, diluted ffo per share, noi and comparable property noi. we believe that these non-gaap measures are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of reits and provide a relevant basis for comparison among reits. we also use these measures internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.
we determine ffo based on the definition set forth by the national association of real estate investment trusts, or nareit, as consolidated net income computed in accordance with gaap:
 excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items and cumulative effects of accounting changes,
 plus the allocable portion of ffo of unconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting based upon economic ownership interest, and
 all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with gaap.
we have adopted nareit's clarification of the definition of ffo that requires us to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale or disposal of, or any impairment charges related to, previously depreciated operating properties.
we include in ffo gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. we also include in ffo the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, legal expenses, transaction expenses and other items required by gaap.
you should understand that our computation of these non-gaap measures might not be comparable to similar measures reported by other reits and that these non-gaap measures:
 should not be considered as alternatives to consolidated net income determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of operating performance, and
 are not alternatives to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

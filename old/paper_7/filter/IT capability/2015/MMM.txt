item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is designed to provide a reader of 3m's financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. 3m's md&a is presented in eight sections:
·   critical accounting estimates
·   financial condition and liquidity
forward-looking statements in item 7 may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the section entitled "cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results" in item 1 and the risk factors provided in item 1a for discussion of these risks and uncertainties).
3m is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products and services. as described in note 16, effective in the third quarter of 2015, within the health care business segment, the company formed the oral care solutions division, which combined the former 3m espe and 3m unitek divisions. 3m manages its operations in five operating business segments: industrial; safety and graphics; health care; electronics and energy; and consumer. from a geographic perspective, any references to emea refer to europe, middle east and africa on a combined basis.
during the fourth quarter of 2015, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions primarily focused on structural overhead, largely in the u.s., and slower-growing markets, with particular emphasis on emea and latin america. this impacted approximately 1,700 positions worldwide and resulted in a fourth-quarter 2015 pre-tax charge of $114 million, $88 million after-tax or $0.14 per diluted share.

acquisitions and divestitures                                           (0.02)                  -
for total year 2015, net income attributable to 3m was $4.833 billion, or $7.58 per diluted share, compared to $4.956 billion, or $7.49 per diluted share, in 2014, an increase of 1.2 percent on a per diluted share basis. operational benefits include the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, partially offset by higher pension/postretirement benefit costs. restructuring actions (discussed above) resulted in an after-tax charge of 14 cents per diluted share. acquisition and divestiture impacts primarily relate to the capital safety and polypore separations media acquisitions, and the divestitures of the license plate converting business in france and substantially all of the library systems business. foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings per diluted share by approximately 43 cents year-on-year, driven by average year-on-year changes in foreign exchange rates in the euro of 17 percent, yen of 12 percent, and brazil real of 30 percent. the income tax rate was largely unchanged year-on-year. weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2015 declined 3.7 percent year-on-year to 637.2 million, which increased earnings per diluted share by approximately 28 cents. refer to the section entitled "results of operations" for further discussion.
for total year 2014, net income attributable to 3m was $4.956 billion, or $7.49 per diluted share, compared to $4.659 billion, or $6.72 per diluted share, in 2013, an increase of 11.5 percent on a per diluted share basis. operational benefits include a significant benefit from the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, plus profit leverage on organic volume growth. foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings per diluted share by approximately 15 cents per diluted share. the income tax rate was 28.9 percent in 2014, up 0.8 percentage points versus 2013, which decreased earnings per diluted share by approximately 8 cents. weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2014 declined 4.6 percent year-on-year to 662.0 million, which increased earnings per diluted share by approximately 34 cents.
fourth-quarter 2015 sales and operating income results:        fourth-quarter 2015 net income attributable to 3m was $1.038 billion, or $1.66 per diluted share, compared to $1.179 billion, or $1.81 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2014. fourth-quarter 2015 sales totaled $7.3 billion, a decrease of 5.4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2014. 3m achieved organic local-currency sales growth (which includes organic volume and selling price impacts) in health care, and consumer, with declines in industrial, safety and graphics, and electronics and energy. organic local-currency sales increased 4.5 percent in health care, led by health information systems, food safety, oral care, drug delivery systems, and critical and chronic care. organic local-currency sales increased 2.7 percent in the consumer business segment, with positive growth in the construction and home improvement business, stationery and office supplies, and home care, while consumer health care declined. organic local-currency sales declined 1.8 percent in industrial, with sales growth in 3m purification and automotive oem more than offset by declines in industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives, and advanced materials. organic local-currency sales declined 2.5 percent in safety and graphics, with sales declines in personal safety partially offset by sales growth in roofing granules, and commercial solutions, while traffic safety and security was flat. electronics and energy organic local-currency sales growth declined 7.7 percent, with decreases in electronic-related sales in both electronics materials solutions, and display materials and systems. energy-related organic local-currency sales declined in renewable energy, communications markets, and electrical markets. for the company in total, organic-local currency sales declined 1.1 percent, with organic volume declines of 2.3 percent partially offset by higher selling prices which added 1.2 percent. acquisitions added 1.9 percent to sales, which related to the march 2015 acquisition of ivera medical corp. (ivera), the august 2015 acquisition of capital safety group s.a.r.l. (capital safety), and the august 2015 acquisition of polypore international inc.'s separations media business (polypore). divestitures reduced sales by 0.4 percent, related to the january 2015 sale of the global static business, and the fourth quarter sale of the license converting business in france, along with substantially all of the library systems business. foreign currency translation reduced sales by 5.8 percent year-on-year.
from a geographic area perspective, fourth-quarter 2015 organic local-currency sales grew 1.1 percent in emea. organic local-currency sales declined 0.4 percent in the united states, 0.6 percent in latin america/canada, and 2.7 percent in asia pacific. in emea, central/east europe showed solid local-currency sales growth in the quarter, while west europe was up slightly, and middle east/africa declined. organic local-currency sales in the united states declined, as 3m experienced weak end-market demand in its industrial-related businesses. the consumer-oriented businesses (health care and consumer) continued to deliver positive organic growth. organic local-currency sales in latin america/canada declined. in latin america, mexico continued its trend of strong organic growth, increasing 7 percent, while brazil declined 6 percent. organic local-currency sales in asia pacific declined 2.7 percent. three of five
business groups posted positive growth in the asia pacific region, led by health care and consumer, while electronics and energy declined. within asia pacific, organic local-currency sales declined by 3 percent in both japan and china/hong kong.        operating income in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 20.5 percent of sales, compared to 21.5 percent of sales in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease of 1.0 percentage points. restructuring charges reduced operating income margins by 1.6 percentage points. in addition, higher pension/postretirement benefit costs reduced margins. these impacts were partially offset by a benefit from the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases.
year 2015 sales and operating income results:        sales totaled $30.3 billion, a decrease of 4.9 percent from 2014. from a business segment perspective, organic local-currency sales increased 3.7 percent in health care, 3.4 percent in consumer, 2.4 percent in safety and graphics, and 0.7 percent in industrial, while sales declined 1.9 percent in electronics and energy. from a geographic area perspective, 2015 organic local-currency sales grew 2.1 percent in the united states, 1.5 percent in latin america/canada, 0.9 percent in asia pacific, and 0.8 percent in emea. for the company in total, organic local-currency sales grew 1.3 percent, with higher organic volumes contributing 0.2 percent and selling price increases contributing 1.1 percent. acquisitions added 0.8 percent to sales, while divestitures reduced sales by 0.2 percent. foreign currency translation reduced sales by 6.8 percent year-on-year. refer to the sections entitled "performance by business segment" and "performance by geographic area" for additional detail.
operating income in 2015 was 22.9 percent of sales, compared to 22.4 percent of sales in 2014, an increase of 0.5 percentage points. these results included a benefit from the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, partially offset by higher pension/postretirement benefit costs. refer to the section entitled "results of operations" for further discussion.
year 2014 sales and operating income results:        for total year 2014, net income attributable to 3m was $4.956 billion, or $7.49 per diluted share, compared to $4.659 billion, or $6.72 per diluted share, in 2013, an increase of 11.5 percent on a per diluted share basis. sales totaled $31.8 billion, an increase of 3.1 percent from 2013. from a business segment perspective, organic local-currency sales grew 5.8 percent in health care, 5.4 percent in safety and graphics, 5.2 percent in electronics and energy, 4.9 percent in industrial, and 3.9 percent in consumer. from a geographic area perspective, 2014 organic local-currency sales grew 6.3 percent in asia pacific, 4.9 percent in the united states, 4.5 percent in latin america/canada, and 3.2 percent in emea. for the company in total, organic local-currency sales grew 4.9 percent, with higher organic volumes contributing 3.9 percent and selling price increases contributing 1.0 percent. acquisitions added 0.1 percent to sales, driven by the treo acquisition. foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.9 percent year-on-year.
operating income in 2014 was 22.4 percent of sales, compared to 21.6 percent of sales in 2013, an increase of 0.8 percentage points. these results included a benefit from the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, lower pension/postretirement benefit costs, and profit leverage on organic volume growth. these factors were partially offset by strategic investments and other factors. refer to the section entitled "results of operations" for further discussion.
the following table contains sales and operating income results by business segment for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014. in addition to the discussion below, refer to the section entitled "performance by business segment" and "performance by geographic area" later in md&a for a more detailed discussion of the sales and income results of the company and its respective business segments (including corporate and unallocated). refer to note 16 for additional information on business segments, including elimination of dual credit.

sales in 2015 decreased 4.9 percent, substantially impacted by foreign currency translation, which reduced sales by 6.8 percent. sales in u.s. dollars declined in consumer by 2.2 percent, health care by 2.7 percent, safety and graphics by 3.8 percent, industrial by 6.0 percent, and electronics and energy by 6.8 percent. total company organic local-currency sales growth (which includes organic volume and selling price impacts) was 1.3 percent, acquisitions added 0.8 percent, divestitures reduced sales by 0.2 percent, and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 6.8 percent. all of 3m's five business segments posted operating income margins of approximately 21 percent or more in 2015. worldwide operating income margins for 2015 were 22.9 percent, compared to 22.4 percent for 2014.
sales in 2014 increased 3.1 percent, led by health care at 4.5 percent, electronics and energy at 3.9 percent, industrial at 3.1 percent, safety and graphics at 2.7 percent, and consumer at 2.0 percent. total company organic local-currency sales growth (which includes organic volume and selling price impacts) was 4.9 percent, acquisitions added 0.1 percent, and foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1.9 percent. all of 3m's five business segments posted operating income margins of approximately 20 percent or more in 2014. worldwide operating income margins for 2014 were 22.4 percent, compared to 21.6 percent for 2013.
financial condition:
3m generated $6.4 billion of operating cash flow in 2015, a decrease of $206 million when compared to 2014. this followed an increase of $809 million when comparing 2014 to 2013. refer to the section entitled "financial condition and liquidity" later in md&a for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. in february 2016, 3m's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3m's outstanding common stock, which replaced the company's february 2014 repurchase program. this new program has no pre-established end date. in 2015, 2014, and 2013, the company purchased more than $5 billion of its own stock each year. the company expects to purchase $4 billion to $6 billion of its own stock in 2016. in february 2016, 3m's board of directors declared a first-quarter 2016 dividend of $1.11 per share, an increase of 8 percent. this marked the 58th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3m. 3m's debt to total capital ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) was 48 percent at december 31, 2015, 34 percent at december 31, 2014, and 25 percent at december 31, 2013. the company has an aa- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from standard & poor's and an aa3 credit rating, with a negative outlook, from moody's investors service. the company has significant cash on hand and sufficient additional access to capital markets to meet its funding needs.
in 2015, the company experienced declining costs for most raw material categories and transportation fuel, due largely to the significant price decreases in crude oil. this in turn drove year-on-year cost decreases in many feedstock categories, including petroleum based materials, minerals, metals and wood pulp based products. to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward contracts.
pension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:
on a worldwide basis, 3m's pension and postretirement plans were 86 percent funded at year-end 2015. the primary u.s. qualified pension plan, which is approximately 69 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 91 percent funded and the international pension plans were 90 percent funded. the u.s. non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. asset returns in 2015 for the primary u.s. qualified pension plan was 0.7%, as 3m strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status. for the primary u.s. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2016 is 7.50%, down 0.25% from 2015. the primary u.s. qualified pension plan year-end 2015 discount rate was 4.47%, up 0.37 percentage points from the year-end 2014 discount rate of 4.10%. the increase in u.s. discount rates resulted in a decreased valuation of the projected benefit obligation (pbo), however the plan's funded status decreased slightly in 2015 as the growth in the pbo increased at a greater rate than the plan assets returned in 2015. additional detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in note 11 (pension and postretirement benefit plans).
3m expects to contribute approximately $100 million to $200 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2016. the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its u.s. plans in 2016. 3m expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2016 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) to decrease by approximately $320 million pre-tax when compared to 2015. refer to "critical accounting estimates" within md&a and note 11 (pension and postretirement benefit plans) for additional information concerning 3m's pension and post-retirement plans.
beginning on january 1, 2016, with respect to defined contribution plans, the company reduced its match on employee 401(k) contributions for u.s. employees. previously, based on the date the employee was hired, up to 6% of eligible compensation was matched in cash at rates of 60%, 75% or 100%. beginning in 2016, 5% of eligible compensation will be matched at rates of 45%, 60% or 100%, respectively. the reduction in the company's match is anticipated to reduce 2016 defined contribution pension expense by approximately $35 million.

in 2015, organic local-currency sales grew 1.3 percent, with increases of 2.1 percent in the united states, 1.5 percent in latin america/canada, 0.9 percent in asia pacific, and 0.8 percent in emea. organic local-currency sales growth was 1.6 percent across developing markets, and 1.2 percent in developed markets. worldwide organic local-currency sales grew 3.7 percent in health care, 3.4 percent in consumer, 2.4 percent in safety and graphics, and 0.7 percent in industrial, while sales declined 1.9 percent in electronics and energy. acquisitions added 0.8 percent to worldwide growth, while divestitures reduced worldwide growth by 0.2 percent. foreign currency translation reduced worldwide sales growth by 6.8 percent.
in 2014, organic local-currency sales grew 4.9 percent, with increases of 6.3 percent in asia pacific, 4.9 percent in the united states, 4.5 percent in latin america/canada, and 3.2 percent in emea. organic local-currency sales grew 5.6 percent across developing markets, and 4.5 percent in developed markets. worldwide organic local-currency sales grew 5.8 percent in health care, 5.4 percent in safety and graphics, 5.2 percent in electronics and energy, 4.9 percent in industrial, and 3.9 percent in consumer. acquisitions added 0.1 percent to worldwide growth and foreign currency translation reduced worldwide sales growth by 1.9 percent.
refer to the sections entitled "performance by business segment" and "performance by geographic area" later in md&a for additional discussion of sales change.
pension and postretirement expense increased $165 million in 2015 compared to 2014, compared to a decrease of $162 million in 2014 compared to 2013. year 2015 includes the impact of a first-quarter 2015 japan pension curtailment gain of $17 million. pension and postretirement expense is recorded in cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (sg&a); and research, development and related expenses (r&d). refer to note 11 (pension and postretirement plans) for components of net periodic benefit cost and the assumptions used to determine net cost.
the company is investing in business transformation. business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3m to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing 3m to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. this is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (erp) system on a worldwide basis.
in the fourth quarter of 2015, as discussed within the overview section above, 3m incurred restructuring charges impacting operating expenses as follows:
cost of sales, measured as a percent of net sales, was 50.9 percent in 2015, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points from 2014. cost of sales as a percent of sales decreased due to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, as selling prices increased net sales by 1.1 percent and raw material cost deflation was favorable by approximately 3.5 percent year-on-year. in addition, higher pension and postretirement costs (of which a portion impacts cost of sales) and fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges, increased cost of sales as a percent of sales.
cost of sales, measured as a percent of net sales, was 51.7 percent in 2014, a decrease of 0.4 percentage points from 2013. cost of sales as a percent of sales decreased due to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, as selling prices increased net sales by 1.0 percent and raw material cost deflation was favorable by approximately 1.5 percent year-on-year. in addition, lower pension and postretirement costs (of which a portion impacts cost of sales), along with organic volume leverage, decreased cost of sales as a percent of sales.
selling, general and administrative expenses (sg&a) decreased $287 million, or 4.4 percent, in 2015 when compared to 2014. the translation of foreign currencies into u.s. dollars reduced sg&a expense, as evidenced by our foreign currency translation impact which reduced worldwide sales by 6.8 percent. this foreign currency translation benefit was partially offset by higher pension and postretirement expense and fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges. sg&a, measured as a percent of sales, increased 0.1 percentage points to 20.4 percent in 2015, compared to 20.3 percent of sales in 2014.
selling, general and administrative expenses (sg&a) increased $85 million, or 1.3 percent, in 2014 when compared to 2013. year 2014 included strategic investments in business transformation, while lower pension and postretirement expense benefitted sg&a. sg&a, measured as a percent of sales, decreased 0.4 percentage points to 20.3 percent in 2014, compared to 20.7 percent of sales in 2013.
research, development and related expenses (r&d) decreased $7 million, or 0.4 percent, in 2015 compared to 2014. r&d increased 3.2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. 3m continued to support its key growth initiatives, including more r&d aimed at disruptive innovation, which refers to innovation which has the potential to create new markets and disrupt existing markets. in 2015, like sg&a, r&d spending in u.s. dollars was reduced due to the translation of foreign currencies into u.s. dollars. these 2015 translation benefits were partially offset by higher pension and postretirement expense in 2015 when compared to 2014. in 2014, increases in r&d, when compared to 2013, were partially offset by lower pension and postretirement expense. r&d, measured as a percent of sales, was 5.8 percent in 2015, compared to 5.6 percent in both 2014 and 2013.
3m uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. refer to the table below for a reconciliation of operating income margins for 2015 versus 2014, and 2014 versus 2013.
pension and postretirement benefit costs                       (0.5)            0.5
acquisitions and divestitures                                  (0.2)          (0.1)
productivity and other                                           0.3              -
operating income margins were 22.9 percent in 2015 compared to 22.4 percent in 2014, an increase of 0.5 percentage points. these results included a significant benefit from the combination of higher selling prices and lower raw material costs, and a benefit from productivity and other items. these benefits were partially offset by higher pension and postretirement benefit costs, 2015 restructuring charges, higher strategic investments, and acquisition and divestiture impacts. strategic investments include incremental programs around disruptive r&d and business transformation. acquisition and divestiture impacts primarily relate to the capital safety and polypore separations media acquisitions, and the divestitures of substantially all of the library systems business, along with the license plate converting business in france.        operating income margins were 22.4 percent in 2014 compared to 21.6 percent in 2013, an increase of 0.8 percentage points. these results included a significant benefit from the combination of higher selling prices and lower raw material costs. in addition, lower year-on-year pension and postretirement benefit costs and profit leverage on organic volume growth provided benefits. items that reduced operating income margins included strategic investments, which included investments in disruptive r&d, business transformation, the supply chain center of expertise in europe, and portfolio management actions. the company invested $90 million in 2014 in portfolio management actions to position 3m for greater success. foreign currency effects and acquisition impacts (treo) reduced operating income margins.
interest expense: interest expense increased slightly in 2015 compared to 2014, despite significantly higher debt levels, helped by lower average interest rates. interest expense decreased in 2014 compared to 2013, again despite higher debt levels, primarily due to lower u.s. borrowing costs as debt maturities were replaced with lower cost financing from commercial paper and lower interest rates on new debt issuances.
capitalized interest related to property, plant and equipment construction in progress is recorded as a reduction to interest expense. the amounts shown in the table above for interest expense are net of capitalized interest amounts of $13 million, $15 million, and $21 million, in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
interest income: interest income in 2015 was lower when compared to 2014 due to lower average cash/marketable securities balances. interest income in 2014 was lower when compared to 2013 due to lower cash balances.
the company currently expects that its effective tax rate for 2016 will be approximately 29.5 to 30.5 percent. the rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors, such as the geographic mix of income before taxes.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non-3m ownership interests in 3m consolidated entities. the changes in noncontrolling interest amounts have largely related to sumitomo 3m limited (japan), which was 3m's most significant consolidated entity with non-3m ownership interests. as discussed in note 6, on september 1, 2014, 3m purchased the remaining 25 percent ownership in sumitomo 3m limited, bringing 3m's ownership to 100 percent. thus, effective september 1, 2014, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was significantly reduced. the primary remaining noncontrolling interest relates to 3m india limited, of which 3m's effective ownership is 75 percent.
3m estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax income by approximately $390 million and $100 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. these estimates include the effect of translating profits from local currencies into u.s. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3m operations in the united states and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the negative impact of swapping venezuelan bolivars into u.s. dollars. 3m estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses increased pre-tax income by approximately $180 million and $10 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. refer to note 12 in the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning 3m's hedging activities.        performance by business segment disclosures relating to 3m's business segments are provided in item 1, business segments. financial information and other disclosures are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. as described in note 16, effective in the third quarter of 2015, within the health care business segment, the company formed the oral care solutions division, which combined the former 3m espe and 3m unitek divisions. 3m manages its operations in five business segments. the reportable segments are industrial; safety and graphics; electronics and energy; health care; and consumer.
in addition to these five business segments, 3m assigns certain costs to "corporate and unallocated," which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in note 16. corporate and unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the company determines not to allocate directly to its business segments. because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.
corporate and unallocated operating expenses increased by $104 million in 2015 when compared to 2014. this increase was driven by higher pension and postretirement benefit expenses, which increased in total by $165 million. of this increase, $153 million was allocated to corporate and unallocated. increases were also driven by fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges of $37 million, as indicated in the below table. items which partially offset these increases within corporate and unallocated included higher administrative and r&d cost absorption by the five business segments, resulting in less under-absorbed expense being allocated to corporate.
corporate and unallocated operating expenses decreased by $70 million in 2014 when compared to 2013. this decrease was driven by lower pension and postretirement benefit expenses, which declined year-on-year by $162 million. of this reduction, $116 million was allocated to corporate and unallocated. this was partially offset by higher corporate and unallocated expenses related to year-on-year increases in annual incentive plan expenses and legal accruals.
each of 3m's business segments incurred restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2015, as indicated in the preceding table. in 2014, each business segment absorbed additional cost related to incremental investments related to business transformation, enabled by 3m's global erp implementation, which impacted each of the five business segments 2014 annual operating income margins by approximately 0.2 percentage points when compared to 2013.

employment decreased by 354 positions in 2015 and increased by 1,133 positions in 2014. the primary factor that decreased employment in 2015 related to fourth-quarter 2015 restructuring actions that impacted approximately 1,700 positions worldwide. the 2015 acquisitions of ivera medical corp., polypore international inc.'s separations media business and capital safety group s.a.r.l. increased 2015 headcount by approximately 2,000 positions. the primary factors that increased employment in 2014 was additions in developing economies to support growth, plus additions related to the treo solutions llc acquisition in 2014.     capital spending/net property, plant and equipment:
investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. 3m's capital spending by geography has been led by the united states (64% of spending in 2015), followed by europe, middle east and africa, asia pacific, and latin america/canada. 3m is continuing to increase its manufacturing and sourcing capability, particularly in developing economies, in order to more closely align its product capability with its sales in major geographic areas. 3m will continue to make investments in critical developing markets, such as brazil, china, mexico, panama, poland, southeast asia, and turkey. capital spending is discussed in more detail later in md&a in the section entitled "cash flows from investing activities."         critical accounting estimates information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note 1. as stated in note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates.
the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the company's pension and postretirement obligations, asset impairments and income taxes. senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of 3m's board of directors.
the categories of claims for which the company has a probable and estimable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings. please refer to the section entitled "process for disclosure and recording of liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings" (contained in "legal proceedings" in note 14) for additional information about such estimates.
3m has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all u.s. employees and many employees outside the united states. the primary u.s. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective january 1, 2009. the company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with accounting standard codification (asc) 715, compensation - retirement benefits, in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost. asc 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders' equity. while the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. see note 11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.
pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant's years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. the benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date. the company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the december 31 measurement date, using the yields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. historically, the single aggregated discount rate used for each plan's benefit obligation was also used for the calculation of all net periodic benefit costs, including the measurement of the service and interest costs. beginning in 2016, 3m changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. the new method measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. the interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. the spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. the company changed to the new method to provide a more precise measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates. the company accounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016. as a result of the change to the spot yield curve approach, 2016 defined benefit pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost is expected to decrease by $180 million. including this $180 million, 3m expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2016 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) to decrease by approximately $320 million pre-tax when compared to 2015.
using this methodology, the company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:
u.s. qualified pension       international pension (weighted average)       u.s. postretirement medical december 31, 2014 liability and 2015 net periodic benefit cost:
december 31, 2015 liability:
benefit obligation                                                                       4.47   %                                       3.12   %                          4.32   %
2016 net periodic benefit cost components:
another significant element in determining the company's pension expense in accordance with asc 715 is the expected return on plan assets, which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes. for the primary u.s. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2016 is 7.50%, 0.25% lower than 2015. refer to note 11 for information on how the 2015 rate was determined. return on assets assumptions for
international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. the weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 5.77% for 2016, compared to 5.90% for 2015.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, the company recognized total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) of $556 million, up from $391 million in 2014. defined benefit pension and postretirement expense (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) is anticipated to decrease to approximately $236 million in 2016, a decrease of $320 million compared to 2015.
the table below summarizes the impact on 2016 pension expense for the u.s. and international pension plans of a 0.25 percentage point increase/decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions used to measure plan liabilities and 2016 net periodic benefit cost. the table assumes all other factors are held constant, including the slope of the discount rate yield curves.
increase (decrease) in net periodic benefit cost discount rate                      expected return on assets
as of december 31, 2015, net property, plant and equipment totaled $8.5 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $2.6 billion. management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. this includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. for instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group.
3m goodwill totaled approximately $9.2 billion as of december 31, 2015. 3m's annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year. impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. at 3m, reporting units generally correspond to a division. 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing.
an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3m typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3m uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to businesses where the price/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3m also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions.
as described in note 16, effective in the third quarter of 2015, within the health care business segment, the company formed the oral care solutions division, which combined the former 3m espe and 3m unitek divisions. for any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes, the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. during the third quarter of 2015, the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed. the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2015 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.
as of october 1, 2015, 3m had 26 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 87 percent of the goodwill. these ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: 3m purification (which
includes the polypore separations media acquisition), advanced materials, communication markets, display materials and systems, health information systems, industrial adhesives and tapes, infection prevention, oral care solutions, personal safety (which includes the capital safety acquisition), and traffic safety and security. the estimated fair values for these reporting units were in excess of carrying value by approximately 50 percent or more, except for one reporting unit with approximately $300 million of goodwill, where the fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 30 percent. 3m's market value at both september 30, 2015, and december 31, 2015, was significantly in excess of its equity of approximately $12 billion at both december 31, 2015 and september 30, 2015.
in 2015, 3m primarily used an industry price-earnings ratio approach, but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units, to determine fair values. where applicable, 3m used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. the weighting was based on management's estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring.
3m is an integrated materials enterprise, thus many of 3m's businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3m's focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3m's value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them. based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2015, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units.
factors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. these risk factors are discussed in item 1a, "risk factors," of this document. in addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results. as indicated above, during the third quarter of 2015, the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by changes between reporting units and determined that no impairment existed. long-lived assets with a definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. if future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3m would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. 3m will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2016 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.
the extent of 3m's operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. the company follows guidance provided by asc 740, income taxes, regarding uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to note 8 for additional information). the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the company's current estimate of the tax liabilities. if the company's estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.     new accounting pronouncements information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
financial condition and liquidity
3m continues its transition to a better-optimized capital structure and is adding leverage at a measured pace. the strength and stability of 3m's business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, enable the company to implement this strategy. investing in 3m's businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority, thus 3m will continue to deploy capital towards research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. investment in organic growth will be supplemented by complementary acquisitions. 3m will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. sources for cash availability in the united states, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases, as well as funding u.s. acquisitions and other items as needed. for those international earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for u.s. operations. however, if these international funds are needed for operations in the u.s., 3m would be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes to repatriate them. see note 8 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.
3m's primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and u.s. commercial paper issuances. the company believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3m's commercial paper program permits the company to have a maximum of $3 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance.
the company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 3m considers net debt and its components to be an important indicator of liquidity and a guiding measure of capital structure strategy. net debt is not defined under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. the following table provides net debt as of december 31, 2015 and 2014.
less: cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities             1,925             3,351
in 2015, net debt rose by $5.4 billion to a net debt balance of $8.9 billion (as of december 31, 2015), as 3m progressed on its capital structure strategy. debt levels were higher in both the u.s. and internationally, while international cash and marketable securities balances were reduced. specific actions related to cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, in addition to debt, are discussed further below.
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities:
at december 31, 2015, 3m had $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $1.7 billion was held by the company's foreign subsidiaries and $200 million was held by the united states. of the $1.7 billion held internationally, u.s. dollar-based cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $355 million, or 21 percent, which was invested in money market funds, asset-backed securities, agency securities, corporate medium-term note securities and other high quality fixed income securities. at december 31, 2014, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by the company's foreign subsidiaries and in the united states totaled approximately $3.3 billion and less than $100 million, respectively.
the company's total balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was $1.4 billion lower at december 31, 2015 when compared to december 31, 2014. 3m was able to manage the business with lower cash levels due to significant ongoing cash flow generation and proven access to capital markets funding throughout business cycles.
the company's total debt was $4.0 billion higher at december 31, 2015 when compared to december 31, 2014. the strength of 3m's capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3m proven access to capital markets. additionally, the company's maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. the company has an aa- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from standard & poor's and an aa3 credit rating, with a negative outlook, from moody's investors service. the company's ongoing transition to a better-optimized capital structure, financed with additional low-cost debt, could impact 3m's credit rating in the future.
effective may 16, 2014, the company updated its "well-known seasoned issuer" shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales. this replaced 3m's previous shelf registration dated august 5, 2011. in june 2014, in connection with the may 16, 2014 shelf registration, 3m re-commenced its medium-term notes program (series f) under which 3m may issue, from time to time, up to $9 billion aggregate principal amount of notes. included in this $9 billion are $8.17 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rate applicable at the time of issuance for the euro denominated debt) of notes previously issued in 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2015 as part of series f. information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in note 10.
in august 2014, 3m amended and extended its existing $1.5 billion five-year multi-currency revolving credit agreement to a $2.25 billion five-year multi-currency revolving credit agreement, with an expiration date of august 2019. this credit agreement includes a provision under which 3m may request an increase of up to $2.25 billion, bringing the total facility up to $4.5 billion (at the lenders' discretion). this facility was undrawn at december 31, 2015. under the $2.25 billion credit agreement, the company is required to maintain its ebitda to interest ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. this is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total ebitda for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. at december 31, 2015, this ratio was approximately 56 to 1. debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. apart from the committed facilities, an additional $241 million in stand-alone letters of credit and $18 million in bank guarantees were also issued and outstanding at december 31, 2015. these lines of credit are utilized in connection with normal business activities.
3m's strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward. the company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities.
various assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) totaled $3.868 billion at december 31, 2015, compared with $6.339 billion at december 31, 2014, a decrease of $2.471 billion. current asset balance changes decreased working capital by $1.317 billion, driven by decreases in marketable securities. current liability balance changes decreased working capital by $1.154 billion, driven by increases in short-term debt.
the company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. these measures are not defined under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. one of the primary working capital measures 3m uses is a combined index, which includes accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable. this combined index (defined as quarterly net sales - fourth quarter at year-end - multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable) was 4.9 at december 31, 2015 compared to 5.0 at december 31, 2014. receivables decreased $84 million, or 2.0 percent, compared with december 31, 2014, as currency translation impacts decreased accounts receivable by $239 million, partially offset by 2015 acquisitions that added $103 million. inventories decreased $188 million, or 5.1 percent, compared with december 31, 2014. the inventory decrease was attributable to currency translation, which decreased inventories by $272 million, partially offset by 2015 acquisitions that added $102 million.
accounts payable decreased by $113 million compared with december 31, 2014, as currency translation impacts reduced accounts payable by $76 million.
return on invested capital (non-gaap measure):
the company uses non-gaap measures to focus on shareholder value creation. 3m uses return on invested capital (roic), defined as annualized after-tax operating income (including interest income) divided by average operating capital. operating capital is defined as net assets (total assets less total liabilities) excluding debt. this measure is not recognized under u.s. gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. roic was 22.5 percent for 2015, and 22.0 percent for 2014.
cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow. individual amounts in the consolidated statement of cash flows exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents, which are presented separately in the cash flows. thus, the amounts presented in the following operating, investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects.     cash flows from operating activities:
excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation             (154)             (167)              (92)
net cash provided by operating activities                    $6,420            $6,626            $5,817
cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows.
in 2015, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $206 million compared to 2014. operating cash flows decreased due to $363 million in higher cash income taxes when comparing 2015 to 2014, plus lower net income, which was partially offset by lower year-on-year working capital requirements. the combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $46 million in 2015, compared to increases of $306 million in 2014, with the year-on-year improvement related to lower organic volume growth. additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the "financial condition and liquidity" section.
in 2014, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $809 million compared to 2013. operating cash flows benefited year-on-year from increases in net income including noncontrolling interest, lower pension and postretirement plans contributions, and lower year-on-year working capital requirements. the combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $306 million in 2014, compared to increases of $407 million in 2013, with the year-on-year improvement partially due to higher receivable and inventory turns. additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the "financial condition and liquidity" section.
in addition, to net cash provided by operating activities, 3m believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are useful measures of performance and uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash. free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 3m defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment (which is classified as an investing activity). it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. 3m defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3m. below find a recap of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion for 2015, 2014 and 2013.

investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. capital spending was $1.461 billion in 2015, compared to $1.493 billion in 2014 and $1.665 billion in 2013. the company expects 2016 capital spending to be approximately $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion as 3m continues to invest in its businesses.
3m invests in renewable and maintenance programs, which pertains to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing current capacity, eliminating pollution, and compliance. costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3m also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities, plus research facilities. finally, 3m also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (it) and corporate laboratory facilities.
in 2015, investments included new sites and buildings, investments in it, continued expansion of current facilities and new facilities, plus the sustainment of existing facilities, in addition to other initiatives. specific investments in 2015 included a new state-of-the-art, four story, 400,000 square foot research facility at 3m center in st. paul, minnesota. in addition, 3m continued its investments it it systems and infrastructure, particularly the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an erp system.
in 2014, investments in growth across geographies included production equipment, new sites and buildings, capacity investments, converting, and distribution, and other growth initiatives. other investments include it systems and infrastructure, including an ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an erp system on a worldwide basis. in
addition, 3m began a multi-year program in the united states to renew and upgrade laboratory facilities and administrative buildings.
in 2013, 3m continued its expansion of manufacturing capacity in key growth markets, including investments in the u.s., china, germany, and brazil. this included significant investments across 3m's many businesses, such as abrasives, industrial adhesives and tapes, advanced materials, electronics-related, infection prevention, and other businesses. 3m continued its investments in it systems and infrastructure. in addition, 3m sustained existing facilities through general maintenance, cost reduction, and compliance efforts.
refer to note 2 for information on acquisitions and divestitures. the company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses.
purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to asset-backed securities, agency securities, corporate debt securities and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. refer to note 9 for more details about 3m's diversified marketable securities portfolio. purchases of investments include additional survivor benefit insurance, plus cost method and equity investments.
cash flows from financing activities:
repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days)                                                 (800)              (1,625)                (859)
proceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days)                                                3,422                2,608                  824

net cash used in financing activities                                                            $(3,648)             $(6,603)             $(5,246)
total debt was $10.8 billion at december 31, 2015, $6.8 billion at december 31, 2014, and $6.0 billion at december 31, 2013. total debt was 48 percent of total capital (total capital is defined as debt plus equity) at year-end 2015, 34 percent of total capital at year-end 2014, and 25 percent of total capital at year-end 2013.
in both 2015 and 2014, the change in short-term debt primarily related to bank borrowings by international subsidiaries, primarily japan and korea in 2015. in 2015, repayment of debt primarily related to debt assumed (and paid off) as part of the capital safety acquisition (refer to note 2). in 2014, repayment of debt primarily includes repayment of a eurobond in july 2014 totaling 1.025 billion euros (approximately $1.4 billion carrying value), repayment of the three-year 66 million british pound committed credit facility agreement entered into in december 2012, and repayment of other international debt. in 2013, repayment of debt related to the august 2013 repayment of $850 million (principal amount) of medium-term notes.

repurchases of common stock are made to support the company's stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. in february 2016, 3m's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3m's outstanding common stock, which replaced the company's february 2014 repurchase program. this authorization has no pre-established end date. in 2015, 2014, and 2013, the company purchased more than $5 billion of its own stock each year. the company expects full-year 2016 gross share repurchases will be in the range of $4 billion to $6 billion. for more information, refer to the table titled "issuer purchases of equity securities" in part ii, item 5. the company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the company's stock.
on september 1, 2014, 3m purchased (via sumitomo 3m limited) sumitomo electric industries, ltd.'s 25 percent interest in 3m's consolidated sumitomo 3m limited subsidiary for 90 billion japanese yen. upon completion of this transaction, 3m owned 100 percent of sumitomo 3m limited. this was reflected as a "purchase of noncontrolling interest" in the financing section of the consolidated statement of cash flows. in addition, in april 2014, 3m purchased the remaining noncontrolling interest in a consolidated 3m subsidiary for an immaterial amount, which was also classified as a "purchase of noncontrolling interest" in the financing section of the consolidated statement of cash flows.
in march 2013, 3m sold shares in 3m india limited, a subsidiary of the company, in return for $8 million. the noncontrolling interest shares of this subsidiary trade on a public exchange in india. this sale of shares complied with an amendment to indian securities regulations that required 3m india limited, as a listed company, to achieve a minimum public shareholding of at least 25 percent. as a result of this transaction, 3m's ownership in 3m india limited was reduced from 76 percent to 75 percent. the $8 million received in the first quarter of 2013 was classified as other financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
in addition to the march 2013 sale of noncontrolling interest described above, other cash flows from financing activities may include various other items, such as changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for capital leases.
as of december 31, 2015, the company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements. refer to the section entitled "warranties/guarantees" in note 14 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees.
in addition to guarantees, 3m, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require the company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3m products or the negligence of 3m personnel, or claims alleging that 3m products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. while 3m's maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the company's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
capital leases (note 14)                                       59                11               6               4             3               3                32
unconditional purchase obligations and other                1,631             1,228             160             102            54              56                31
long-term debt payments due in 2016 and 2017 include floating rate notes totaling $126 million (classified as current portion of long-term debt), and $96 million (included as a separate floating rate note in the long-term debt table), respectively, as a result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments. interest projections on both floating and fixed rate long-term debt, including the effects of interest rate swaps, are based on effective interest rates as of december 31, 2015.
unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company. included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. these estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. the company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the company's expected capital spending in 2016 and beyond. the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated. the majority of 3m's products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. for this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the company's expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis.
other obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled "unconditional purchase obligations and other," include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under asc 740, which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months. the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long-term portion of the net tax liability of $208 million is excluded from the preceding table. refer to note 8 for further details.
as discussed in note 11, the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its u.s. plans in 2016 and company contributions to its u.s. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table.
financial instruments the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. to help manage borrowing costs, the company may enter into interest rate swaps. under these arrangements, the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward contracts.
refer to item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk", for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk, interest rates risk, commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10-k, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item 8, and the discussion of risks and cautionary factors that may affect future results in item 1a. risk factors.
description of our company we are a holding company whose subsidiaries and affiliates, and their licensees, are engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, other tobacco products and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the united states of america. we manage our business in four segments:
our products are sold in more than 180 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. we have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. our portfolio comprises both international and local brands.
we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products, net of sales and promotion incentives. our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell. mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premium-price brands to mid-price or low-price brands in any given market (product mix). mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets (geographic mix). we often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to governments, and, in those circumstances, we include the excise taxes in our net revenues and in excise taxes on products. our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs.
our marketing, administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products, other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products (including general corporate expenses), and costs incurred to develop new products. the most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses.
philip morris international inc. is a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized. as a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock.
certain prior years' amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation. in the fourth quarter of 2015, to further align with the member state composition of the european union, pmi transferred the management of its operations in bulgaria, croatia, romania and slovenia from its eema segment to its european union segment, resulting in the reclassification of prior year amounts between the two segments. the changes did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented.

see the discussion of events affecting the comparability of statement of earnings amounts in the consolidated operating results section of the following discussion and analysis.
•   asset impairment and exit costs - during 2015, we recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $68 million ($52 million after tax or $0.03 per share) related to severance costs for the organizational restructuring in the european union segment. during 2014, we recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $535 million ($409 million after tax or $0.26 per share) related to the factory closures in the netherlands, australia and canada and the restructuring of the u.s. leaf purchasing model.
on april 4, 2014, we announced the initiation by our affiliate philip morris holland b.v. ("pmh") of consultations with employee representatives on a proposal to discontinue cigarette production at its factory located in bergen op zoom, the netherlands. pmh reached an agreement with the trade unions and their members on a social plan and ceased cigarette production on september 1, 2014. during 2014, we recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $489 million. for further details, see the asset impairment and exit costs section of the following discussion and analysis.
•   income taxes - our effective income tax rate for 2015 decreased by 1.1 percentage points to 28.0%. the effective tax rate for 2014 was unfavorably impacted by the above asset impairment and exit costs related to the factory closures. the 2015 tax items that increased our diluted eps by $0.03 per share in the table above represents a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $41 million following the conclusion of the irs examinations of altria group, inc.'s ("altria") consolidated tax returns for the years 2007 and 2008 and pmi's consolidated tax returns for the years 2009 through 2011. prior to march 28, 2008, pmi was a wholly owned subsidiary of altria. the change in tax rate that increased our diluted eps by $0.04 per share in the table above was primarily due to earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction and repatriation cost differences.
•   currency - the unfavorable currency impact during 2015 results from the strengthening of the u.s. dollar, especially against the argentine peso, australian dollar, canadian dollar, euro, indonesian rupiah, japanese yen, mexican peso, russian ruble, turkish lira and the ukrainian hryvnia. this unfavorable currency movement has impacted our profitability across our primary revenue markets and local currency cost bases.
•   eema: higher pricing, partially offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs, unfavorable volume/mix and higher manufacturing costs;
•   latin america &amp; canada: higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix, higher manufacturing costs and higher marketing, administration and research costs;
•   european union: higher pricing and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs and unfavorable volume/mix; and
•   asia: higher pricing, partially offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs, unfavorable volume/mix and higher manufacturing costs.
for further details, see the consolidated operating results and operating results by business segment sections of the following discussion and analysis.
• 2016 forecasted results - on february 4, 2016, we announced our forecast for 2016 full-year reported diluted eps to be in a range of $4.25 to $4.35, at prevailing exchange rates at that time, versus $4.42 in 2015. excluding an unfavorable currency impact, at then-prevailing rates, of approximately $0.60 per share for the full-year 2016, the reported diluted earnings per share range represents an increase of approximately 10% to 12% versus adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.42 in 2015. this forecast does not include any share repurchases in 2016. the company will revisit the potential for repurchases as the year unfolds, depending on the currency environment. we estimate 2016 international cigarette volume, excluding the people's republic of china and the u.s., to decline by approximately 2.0%-2.5%, in line with the estimated decline of 2.4% in 2015.
we calculated 2015 adjusted diluted eps as reported diluted eps of $4.42, plus the $0.03 per share charge related to asset impairment and exit costs, less the $0.03 per share benefit related to discrete tax items.
adjusted diluted eps is not a measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("u.s. gaap"). we define adjusted diluted eps as reported diluted eps adjusted for asset impairment and exit costs, discrete tax items and unusual items. we believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure as it represents core earnings, improves comparability and helps investors analyze business performance and trends. adjusted diluted eps should be considered neither in isolation nor as a substitute for reported diluted eps prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap.
this 2016 guidance excludes the impact of future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, future changes in currency exchange rates and any unusual events. the factors described in item 1a. risk factors represent continuing risks to this forecast.

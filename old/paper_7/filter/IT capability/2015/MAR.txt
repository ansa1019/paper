item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
business and overview overview we are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotels and timeshare properties in 87 countries and territories under 19 brand names. we also develop, operate, and market residential properties and provide services to home/condominium owner associations. under our business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels, rather than own them. we group our operations into three business segments: north american full-service, north american limited-service, and international.
we earn base management fees and in many cases incentive management fees from the properties that we manage, and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us. base fees typically consist of a percentage of property-level revenue while incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit adjusted for a specified owner return. net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit (house profit) less non-controllable expenses such as insurance, real estate taxes, and capital spending reserves.
our emphasis on long-term management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness, while adding new hotels to our system generates growth, typically with little or no investment by the company. this strategy has driven substantial growth while minimizing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. in addition, we believe minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we do make maximizes and maintains our financial flexibility.
we remain focused on doing the things that we do well; that is, selling rooms, taking care of our guests, and making sure we control costs both at company-operated properties and at the corporate level ("above-property"). our brands remain strong as a result of skilled management teams, dedicated associates, superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, significant distribution, our marriott rewards and the ritz-carlton rewards loyalty programs, a multichannel reservations system, and desirable property amenities. we strive to effectively leverage our size and broad distribution.
we, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. we address, through various means, hotels in our system that do not meet standards. we continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary, information-rich, and easy-to-use website, marriott.com, and of our associated mobile smartphone applications and mobile website that connect to marriott.com, through functionality and service improvements, and we expect to continue capturing an increasing proportion of property-level reservations via this cost-efficient channel.
our profitability, as well as that of owners and franchisees, has benefited from our approach to property-level and above-property productivity. properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls. we also control above-property costs, some of which we allocate to hotels, by remaining focused on systems, processing, and support areas.
pending combination with starwood hotels & resorts worldwide, inc.
on november 15, 2015, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement") to combine with starwood hotels & resorts worldwide, inc. ("starwood"). the merger agreement provides for the company to combine with starwood in a series of transactions after which starwood will be an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company (the "starwood combination"). if these transactions are completed, shareholders of starwood will receive 0.920 shares of our class a common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and $2.00 in cash, without interest, for each share of starwood common stock, par value $0.01 per share, that they own immediately before these transactions. we expect that the combination will close in mid-2016, after customary conditions are satisfied, including shareholder approvals, required antitrust approvals, and the completion of starwood's previously announced spin-off of its vacation ownership business, or another spin-off, split-off, analogous disposition, or sale of its vacation ownership business.
performance measures we believe revenue per available room ("revpar"), which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. we also believe occupancy and average daily rate ("adr"), which are components of calculating revpar, are meaningful indicators of our performance. occupancy, which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available, measures the utilization of a property's available capacity. adr, which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold, measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels.
we define our comparable properties as those that were open and operating under one of our brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year (since january 1, 2014 for the current period), and have not, in either the current or previous year: (i) undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions, (ii) been converted between company-operated and franchised, or (iii) sustained substantial property damage or business interruption. comparable properties represented the following percentages of our properties for each year indicated: (1) 86% of north american properties (87% excluding delta hotels and resorts) in 2015, 87% in 2014, and 89% in 2013; (2) 57% of international properties (68% excluding protea hotels) in 2015, 57% (71% excluding protea hotels) in 2014, and 75% in 2013; and (3) 82% of total properties (85% excluding protea hotels and delta hotels and resorts) in 2015, 82% of total properties (85% excluding protea hotels) in 2014, and 87% in 2013.
we also believe company-operated house profit margin, which is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit to total property-level revenue, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. house profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. house profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses.
in 2015, bookings for future group business in the u.s. improved. new group business booked in 2015 for any period in the future increased 9 percent year over year. the 2016 group revenue pace for systemwide full-service hotels (marriott, jw marriott, renaissance, the ritz-carlton, and gaylord brands) in north america was up more than 6 percent as of year-end 2015, compared to the 2015 group booking pace measured as of year-end 2014. in north america, revpar from transient
the europe region experienced higher demand in 2015 across most countries, primarily due to increased group and transient business driven by special events and the weak currency, partially constrained by weaker demand in france, particularly late in the year. results improved in russia due to increased domestic travel. in the asia pacific region, demand increased led by growth from corporate and other transient business in japan, india, thailand, and indonesia. the growth was partially offset by weaker results in south korea. revpar in greater china moderated in 2015 due to the impact of supply growth in certain southern china markets, continued austerity in beijing, and lower inbound travel to hong kong, while demand in shanghai remained strong. middle east demand was weaker in 2015, reflecting the region's instability and lower oil prices, partially offset by strong government and group demand in saudi arabia. demand in the united arab emirates was constrained mainly by new supply and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in travelers from russia. in africa, results were favorable in 2015. in the caribbean and latin america, strong performance in the region in 2015 was driven by greater demand in mexico and increased leisure travel to our caribbean and mexican resorts for most of the year, constrained somewhat by oversupply of hotels in panama and weaker economies in brazil and puerto rico.
we monitor market conditions and provide the tools for our hotels to price rooms daily in accordance with individual property demand levels, generally adjusting room rates as demand changes. our hotels modify the mix of business to improve revenue as demand changes. demand for higher rated rooms improved in most markets in 2015, which allowed our hotels to reduce discounting and special offers for transient business in many markets. this mix improvement benefited adr. for our company-operated properties, we continue to focus on enhancing property-level house profit margins and making productivity improvements.
the $26 million increase in base management fees reflected stronger revpar ($29 million) and the impact of unit growth across our system ($25 million), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($11 million), lower fees due to properties that converted from managed to franchised ($7 million), and decreased recognition of previously deferred fees ($8 million).
the $108 million increase in total franchise fees reflected the impact of unit growth across our system ($55 million), stronger revpar due to increased demand ($31 million), increased relicensing and application fees ($22 million), and higher fees from properties that converted to franchised from managed ($7 million), partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($7 million).
the $17 million increase in incentive management fees reflected higher revpar and house profit margins primarily at company-managed north american properties, particularly at a few large portfolios of managed hotels whose improved net house profits allowed them to reach their owners priority threshold and begin to record incentive fees. higher incentive fees also reflected the addition of hotels included in the delta hotels and resorts acquisition, partially offset by $15 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates and $7 million of lower incentive fees from properties under renovation.
acquired as part of our acquisition of protea hotels in the 2014 second quarter. lower owned and leased revenue reflected net weaker performance impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates, a decrease of $27 million attributable to properties that converted to managed or franchised or left our system, and $16 million net unfavorable impact of properties under renovation, partially offset by increases of $10 million from protea hotel leases we acquired in the 2014 second quarter and $6 million from the miami beach edition hotel, which opened in the 2014 fourth quarter and which we subsequently sold in the 2015 first quarter as discussed in footnote no. 3, "acquisitions and dispositions."
cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer but also includes reimbursements for other costs, such as those associated with our rewards programs, reservations, and marketing programs. as we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating or net income. the $575 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue reflected the impact of higher occupancies and growth across our system. since the end of 2014, our managed rooms increased by 12,668 rooms and our franchised rooms increased by 31,883 rooms, net of rooms at hotels exiting our system.
the $51 million increase in total base management fees, largely reflected stronger revpar due to increased demand ($34 million), the impact of unit growth across our system ($21 million), and increased recognition of previously deferred fees ($16 million), partially offset by a decrease in fees from terminated units ($8 million), decreased fees due to properties that converted from managed to franchised ($8 million), unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($6 million), and three fewer days of activity ($2 million).
the $79 million increase in total franchise fees, reflected stronger revpar due to increased demand ($35 million), new unit growth across our system ($35 million), increased relicensing fees ($10 million), and fees from properties that converted to franchised from managed ($7 million), partially offset by a decrease in fees from terminated units ($4 million) and three fewer days of activity ($3 million).
the $46 million increase in incentive management fees largely reflected higher net house profit at our north american and international managed hotels in addition to unit growth in international markets, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($5 million) and higher north american full-service deferred fees recognized in 2013 ($5 million). we estimate that the three fewer days of activity in 2014 compared to 2013 reduced fee revenues by approximately $5 million.
the $72 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, predominantly reflected $56 million of higher owned and leased revenue, $17 million in revenue from various protea hotels programs, $9 million in higher branding fees, and $2 million in other program revenue, partially offset by $14 million lower termination fee revenue in 2014. higher owned and leased revenue reflected $43 million from protea hotel leases associated with the acquisition, $30 million in revenue from a north american full-service managed property that we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter, and stronger performance across our new and existing owned and leased international properties, partially offset by $37 million attributable to five international properties that converted to managed or franchised properties. combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled $127 million in 2014 and $118 million in 2013.
depreciation, amortization and other expense decreased by $9 million (6 percent) to $139 million in 2015 from $148 million in 2014. the decrease reflected a $25 million favorable variance to the 2014 impairment charge on the edition hotels, partially offset by the 2015 impairment charges of $6 million for the miami beach edition residences and $6 million for the new york (madison square park) edition, which are both discussed in footnote no. 3, "acquisitions and dispositions," and a $4 million impairment charge on corporate equipment.
general, administrative, and other expenses decreased by $25 million (4 percent) to $634 million in 2015 from $659 million in 2014. the decrease largely reflected a $28 million net favorable impact to our legal expenses associated with litigation resolutions, $24 million of development costs that we deferred in 2015 related to our growing franchise pipeline, and $5 million in lower foreign exchange losses compared to the 2014 devaluation of assets denominated in venezuelan bolivars, partially offset by $20 million of higher costs incurred to grow our brands globally, $5 million of transaction costs related to the starwood combination, and $5 million from the delta hotels and resorts acquisition.
depreciation, amortization and other expense increased by $21 million (17 percent) to $148 million in 2014 from $127 million in 2013. the increase reflected the $25 million net impairment charge on the edition hotels discussed in footnote no. 3, "acquisitions and dispositions," $5 million in accelerated amortization related to contract terminations, $5 million in higher contract amortization primarily from protea hotels, and $3 million in higher depreciation related to a north american full-service property that we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter, partially offset by $13 million of accelerated amortization related to contract terminations in 2013 and $5 million of 2013 depreciation for two international properties that converted to managed contracts.
general, administrative, and other expenses increased by $10 million (2 percent) to $659 million in 2014 from $649 million in 2013. the increase largely reflected $9 million from the addition of protea hotels and related transition costs, $7 million from net unfavorable foreign exchange rates, primarily from the devaluation of assets denominated in venezuelan bolivars, and $6 million of increased guarantee funding, partially offset by $8 million litigation settlements recognized in 2013, and a $5 million performance cure payment in 2013 for an international property.
gains and other income, net increased by $19 million (238 percent) to $27 million in 2015 compared to $8 million in 2014. the increase primarily reflects the $41 million gain on the redemption of our preferred equity ownership interest, discussed in footnote no. 14, "fair value of financial instruments." the increase was partially offset by an $11 million disposal loss for an international property and a $4 million expected disposal loss for a north american limited-service segment plot of land, both discussed in footnote no. 3, "acquisitions and dispositions."
interest expense increased by $52 million (45 percent) to $167 million in 2015 compared to $115 million in 2014. the increase was due to net lower capitalized interest expense as a result of the completion of the miami beach edition in the 2014 fourth quarter and the new york (madison square park) edition in the 2015 second quarter ($25 million), interest on the series o notes and series p notes that we issued in the 2015 third quarter and the series n notes that we issued in the 2014 fourth quarter ($17 million), and an unfavorable variance to the 2014 debt premium accretion true-up ($7 million).
interest expense decreased by $5 million (4 percent) to $115 million in 2014 compared to $120 million in 2013. this decrease was principally from $8 million in higher debt premium accretion which included a true-up, $2 million in lower interest on an exited lease obligation, $2 million decrease due to lower interest rates on our marriott rewards program, and a $2 million increase in capitalized interest primarily related to development of edition hotels in miami beach and new york, offset by completion of the london edition in the 2013 fourth quarter. this was partially offset by a net $8 million increase due to the issuance of higher net senior note borrowings.
interest income decreased by $1 million (3 percent) to $29 million in 2015 compared to $30 million in 2014. this decrease was primarily due to lower interest income on the preferred equity ownership interest that was redeemed in the 2015 second quarter ($5 million), partially offset by higher interest income on the $85 million mezzanine loan (net of a $15 million discount) we provided to an owner in conjunction with entering into a franchise agreement for an international property in the 2014 second quarter ($5 million).
interest income increased by $7 million (30 percent) to $30 million in 2014 compared to $23 million in 2013. the increase was primarily due to $6 million earned on the $85 million mezzanine loan (net of a $15 million discount) provided to an owner in conjunction with entering into a franchise agreement for an international property in the 2014 second quarter, and $2 million earned on the mandatorily redeemable preferred equity ownership interest acquired in the 2013 second quarter. see footnote no. 13, "notes receivable" for more information on the mezzanine loan.
equity in earnings (losses)
equity in earnings of $16 million in 2015 increased by $10 million from equity in earnings of $6 million in 2014. the increase reflects a $22 million year-over-year impact from the reversal in 2015 of an $11 million litigation reserve that was recorded in 2014 and associated with an equity investment and a $5 million benefit recorded in 2015 following an adjustment to an international investee's liabilities. the increase was partially offset by a $6 million impairment charge relating to an
international joint venture and an unfavorable variance to a $9 million benefit recorded in 2014 for two of our international investments, following the reversal of their liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which they operate.
equity in earnings of $6 million in 2014 improved by $11 million from equity in losses of $5 million in 2013. the increase was driven by a $9 million reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which two of our international joint ventures operate, $9 million in higher earnings from three of our international and one of our north american full-service joint ventures, and a favorable variance from a $4 million impairment charge in the 2013 second quarter associated with a corporate investment (not allocated to any of our segments) that we determined was fully impaired because we do not expect to recover the investment. this was partially offset by an $11 million litigation reserve associated with another equity investment discussed above (not allocated to any of our segments).
our tax provision increased by $61 million (18 percent) to $396 million in 2015 from $335 million in 2014. the increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings and unfavorable comparisons to the 2014 resolution of a u.s. federal tax issue relating to a guest marketing program, the 2014 release of an international valuation allowance, and the 2014 resolution of an international financing activity tax issue. the increase was partially offset by a favorable irs settlement relating to share-based compensation ($12 million), a tax benefit from an international property disposition ($7 million), and a favorable comparison to the 2014 tax on unrealized foreign exchange gains that were taxed within a foreign jurisdiction ($5 million).
our tax provision increased by $64 million (24 percent) to $335 million in 2014 from $271 million in 2013. the increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings, unrealized foreign exchange gains that were taxed within a foreign jurisdiction, and non-recurring favorable foreign true-ups in 2013. the increase was partially offset by the favorable resolution of a u.s. federal tax issue relating to a guest marketing program ($21 million), the release of an international valuation allowance ($7 million), and the resolution of an international financing activity tax issue ($5 million).
adjusted earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("adjusted ebitda")
earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda"), a financial measure not required by, or presented in accordance with, u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), reflects net income excluding the impact of interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. our non-gaap measure of adjusted ebitda further adjusts ebitda to exclude (1) the pre-tax edition impairment charges of $12 million in 2015 and $25 million in 2014, which we recorded in the "depreciation, amortization, and other" caption of our income statements following an evaluation of our edition hotels and residences for recovery; (2) the $15 million pre-tax loss on dispositions of real estate, which we recorded in the "gains and other income, net" caption of our income statements in 2015; (3) the $41 million pre-tax gain triggered by a mandatory redemption feature of a preferred equity investment in 2015; and (4) share-based compensation expense for all periods presented.
we believe that adjusted ebitda is a meaningful indicator of our operating performance because it permits period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing core operations before the excluded items and facilitates our comparison of results before these items with results from other lodging companies, and because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the lodging industry. for example, interest expense can be dependent on a company's capital structure, debt levels, and credit ratings, and accordingly interest expense's impact on earnings varies significantly among companies. similarly, tax positions will vary among companies as a result of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. as a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. our adjusted ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization expense which we report under "depreciation, amortization, and other," as well as depreciation included under "reimbursed costs" in our income statements, because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. these differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies. we also exclude share-based compensation expense to address the considerable variability among companies in recording compensation expense because companies use share-based payment awards differently, both in the type and quantity of awards granted.
adjusted ebitda has limitations and should not be considered in isolation or a substitute for performance measures calculated under gaap. this non-gaap measure excludes certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make. in addition,
other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do or may not calculate it at all, which limits the usefulness of adjusted ebitda as a comparative measure.
we present our 2015 and 2014 adjusted ebitda calculations that reflect the changes we describe above and reconcile this measure with net income in the following table:

the following discussion reflects all three of our reportable segments. we consider total segment revenues and total segment profits (as defined in footnote no. 16, "business segments") to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability and enable investors to compare the revenues and profits of our operations to our competitors.
we added 300 properties (51,547 rooms) and 51 properties (6,328 rooms) exited our system in 2015.
total segment revenues increased by $678 million to $14,218 million in 2015, a five percent increase from revenues of $13,540 million in 2014, and total segment profits increased by $111 million to $1,504 million in 2015, an eight percent increase from $1,393 million in 2014.
the year-over-year increase in segment revenues of $678 million was a result of a $572 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, a $109 million increase in franchise fees, a $26 million increase in base management fees, and a $17 million increase in incentive management fees, partially offset by a $46 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue. the year-over-year increase of $111 million in segment profits reflected a $109 million increase in franchise fees, a $26 million increase in base management fees, and a $17 million increase in incentive management fees, partially offset by a $20 million decrease in gains and other income, net, a $12 million decrease in equity in earnings, a $6 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses, and a $3 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses. for more information on the variances, see the preceding sections beginning with "revenues."
in 2015, 68 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 50 percent in 2014. managed properties that paid incentive management fees in 2015 represented 63 percent of properties in north america and 74 percent outside of north america, compared to 36 percent in north america and 73 percent outside of north america in 2014. the percentage of north american properties that paid incentive management fees to us increased compared to 2014 due to a few large north american limited-service portfolios of properties that paid incentive management fees in 2015 but did not do so in 2014. in addition, in 2015, 51 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside of north america versus 56 percent in 2014.
compared to 2014, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2015 increased by 80 basis points and worldwide comparable company-operated house profit per available room ("hp-par") increased by 7.5 percent on a constant u.s. dollar basis, reflecting higher occupancy, rate increases, improved productivity, and solid cost controls. these same factors contributed to north american company-operated house profit margins increasing by 80 basis points compared to 2014. hp-par at those same properties increased by 7.8 percent. international company-operated house profit margins increased by 70 basis points, and hp-par at those properties increased by 6.9 percent reflecting increased demand and higher revpar in most locations and improved productivity.
we added 311 properties (46,050 rooms) and 52 properties (6,418 rooms) exited our system in 2014. these figures do not include residential units. during 2014, we also added two residential properties (30 units) and no residential properties or units exited our system.
total segment revenues increased by $1,022 million to $13,540 million in 2014, an 8 percent increase from revenues of $12,518 million in 2013, and total segment profits increased by $196 million to $1,393 million in 2014 from $1,197 million in 2013.
the year-over-year increase in segment revenues of $1,022 million was a result of a $787 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, an $80 million increase in franchise fees, a $58 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, a $51 million increase in base management fees, and a $46 million increase in incentive management fees. the year-over-year increase of $196 million in segment profits reflected an $80 million increase in franchise fees, a $51 million increase in base management fees, a $46 million increase in incentive management fees, $19 million of lower joint venture equity losses, a $11 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, and $4 million of lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense, partially offset by a $16 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses. for more information on the variances, see the preceding sections beginning with "revenues."
outside of north america, compared to 21 percent in north america and 70 percent outside of north america in 2013. in addition, in 2014, 56 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside of north america versus 58 percent in 2013. further, we earned $24 million in incentive management fees in 2014 from properties that did not earn any incentive management fees in 2013.
compared to 2013, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2014 increased by 120 basis points and hp-par increased by 9.7 percent on a constant u.s. dollar basis, reflecting higher occupancy, rate increases, improved productivity, and solid cost controls. these same factors contributed to north american company-operated house profit margins increasing by 150 basis points compared to 2013. hp-par at those same properties increased by 11.4 percent. international company-operated house profit margins increased by 70 basis points, and hp-par at those properties increased by 6.6 percent reflecting increased demand and higher revpar in most locations and improved productivity. note that 2014 had three fewer days of activity when compared to 2013.
development in 2015, we added 300 properties with 51,547 rooms across our brands, including 9,590 rooms from the acquisition of delta hotels and resorts, and 51 properties (6,328 rooms) left our system. no residential properties entered or left our system. highlights of the year included:
•   converting 39 properties (7,301 rooms), or 14 percent of our gross room additions for the year, to our brands;
•   adding 173 properties (19,712 rooms) to our north american limited-service brands.
we believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. nonetheless, our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new marriott-branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third-party owners. these growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. see the "forward-looking statements" and "risks and uncertainties" captions earlier in this report and the "liquidity and capital resources" caption later in this report.

segment profits         $561                $524                $490                 7   %                      7   %
in 2015, across our north american full-service segment we added 57 properties (15,345 rooms), including 37 properties (9,590 rooms) from the delta hotels and resorts acquisition, and five properties (1,398 rooms) left our system.
the $37 million increase in segment profits, compared to 2014, was driven by $44 million of higher base management and franchise fees and $10 million of higher incentive management fees, partially offset by $6 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, $4 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, $4 million of lower gains and other income, net, and $3 million of higher depreciation, amortization, and other expense.
base management and franchise fees were higher due to stronger revpar driven by rate and unit growth, partially offset by $5 million of contract modifications and terminations. increased incentive management fees were primarily driven by higher net house profits at managed hotels.
general, administrative, and other expenses were higher due to $5 million from the delta hotels and resorts acquisition and $2 million in higher reserves for guarantee funding, partially offset by $3 million of other property expenses incurred in 2014.
the $34 million increase in segment profits, compared to 2013, was driven by $30 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $17 million of higher incentive management fees, and $5 million of lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense, partially offset by $11 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, and $8 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses.
base management and franchise fees were higher due to stronger revpar as a result of increased demand and unit growth, partially offset by $7 million from terminated units. the increase in incentive management fees was primarily driven by higher net house profit at managed hotels, partially offset by $5 million in deferred fees recognized in 2013.
north american limited-service includes ac hotels by marriott, courtyard, residence inn, springhill suites, fairfield inn & suites, and towneplace suites located in the united states and canada.
segment profits         $651                $574                $479                 13   %                     20   %
in 2015, across our north american limited-service segment we added 173 properties (19,712 rooms) and 26 properties (2,820 rooms) left our system. the majority of the properties that left our system were fairfield inn & suites and residence inn properties.
for the twelve months ended december 31, 2015, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, revpar for comparable systemwide north american limited-service properties increased by 5.6 percent to $94.99, occupancy for these properties increased by 0.5 percentage points to 74.4 percent, and average daily rates increased by 4.9 percent to $127.65.
the $77 million increase in segment profits, compared to 2014, reflected $73 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $13 million of higher incentive management fees, $2 million of lower general, administrative, and other
expenses, and $1 million of lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense, partially offset by $5 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, $4 million of lower gains and other income, net, and $3 million of lower equity in earnings.
base management and franchise fees were higher due to unit growth and stronger room rates, including $19 million of higher franchise licensing and application fees, partially offset by a $5 million reduction in previously deferred fees and $3 million of contract terminations. increased incentive management fees were primarily driven by a few large portfolios of managed hotels whose improved net house profits allowed them to reach their owners priority threshold and begin to record incentive fees.
gains and other income, net were lower due to a $4 million expected disposal loss on a plot of land. see footnote no. 3, "acquisitions and dispositions" for more information.
lower equity in earnings was driven by the redemption of our investment in an entity that owns two hotels.
cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our north american limited-service segment properties totaled $2,366 million in 2015, compared to $2,217 million in 2014.
in 2014, across our north american limited-service segment we added 120 properties (13,928 rooms) and 32 properties (3,030 rooms) left our system. the majority of the properties that left our system were fairfield inn & suites and residence inn properties.
for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2013, revpar for comparable systemwide north american limited-service properties increased by 7.5 percent to $89.11, occupancy for these properties increased by 2.3 percentage points to 74.0 percent, and average daily rates increased by 4.2 percent to $120.36.
the $95 million increase in segment profits, compared to 2013, primarily reflected $80 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $11 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, and $7 million of higher incentive management fees.
higher base management and franchise fees were primarily driven by higher revpar for comparable properties and unit growth, and included $15 million of higher deferred management fees and $10 million of higher relicensing fees. increased incentive management fees resulted from net house profit growth at managed hotels.
cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our north american limited-service segment properties totaled $2,217 million in 2014, compared to $1,939 million in 2013.
international includes properties, regardless of brand, that are located outside the united states and canada.
segment profits         $292                $295                $228       (1         )%                    29   %
the $3 million decrease in segment profits in 2015, compared to 2014, consisted of $12 million of lower gains and other income, net, $9 million of lower equity in earnings, $6 million of lower incentive management fees, and $4 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, partially offset by $18 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $8 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, and $2 million of lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense.
base management and franchise fees increased due to stronger revpar, driven by both occupancy and rate, and unit growth, partially offset by the impact of $16 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates. lower incentive management fees reflected $15 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher net house profit at managed hotels and unit growth.
general, administrative, and other expenses increased primarily due to higher costs for branding and service initiatives to grow our brands globally.
lower gains and other income, net primarily reflected an $11 million loss on the sale of an international property discussed in footnote no. 3, "acquisitions and dispositions."
lower equity in earnings reflected an unfavorable variance to a $9 million benefit recorded in 2014 for two of our international investments, following the reversal of their liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which they operate, and a $6 million impairment charge relating to an international joint venture, partially offset by a $5 million benefit recorded in 2015 following an adjustment to an international investee's liabilities.
the $67 million increase in segment profits in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily consisted of $22 million in higher incentive management fees, $21 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $17 million of higher equity in earnings, and $11 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, partially offset by $6 million higher general, administrative, and other expenses.
the increase in base management and franchise fees was driven by unit growth and higher revpar, partially offset by the impact of $3 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates and $4 million from terminated units. increased incentive management fees were primarily driven by higher net house profit at managed hotels and unit growth, partially offset by the impact of $4 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates.
the increase of equity in earnings was driven by a $9 million reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which two of our international joint ventures operate and $7 million in increased earnings at three of our joint ventures.
the increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses largely reflected $10 million from protea hotels programs and leases acquired in the 2014 second quarter, $5 million in higher costs in 2013 related to three leases we terminated, $5 million of pre-opening costs in 2013, $4 million from new units, and $4 million of favorable operating profits, partially offset by an unfavorable variance of $12 million in termination fees recognized in 2013, and $6 million in earnings from properties that converted to managed or franchised.
the increase in general, administrative, and other expenses was primarily due to $5 million related to the protea hotels acquisition and $5 million in higher compensation, partially offset by a $5 million performance cure payment for one property in 2013.
share-based compensation under our stock and cash incentive plan, we award: (1) stock options to purchase our common stock; (2) stock appreciation rights ("sars") for our common stock; (3) restricted stock units ("rsus") of our common stock; and (4) deferred stock units. we also issue performance-based rsus ("psus") to named executive officers and some of their direct reports under the stock and cash incentive plan.
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements and our credit facilities our multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the "credit facility") provides for $2,000 million of aggregate effective borrowings to support general corporate needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, letters of credit, and acquisitions. the availability of the credit facility also supports our commercial paper program. in addition, we may use borrowings under the credit facility, or commercial paper supported by the credit facility, to finance all or part of the cash component of the consideration to starwood shareholders in connection with the starwood combination and certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the combination. borrowings under the credit facility generally bear interest at libor (the london interbank offered rate) plus a spread, based on our public debt rating. we also pay quarterly fees on the credit facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. the term of the credit facility expires on july 18, 2018.
the credit facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage (consisting of the ratio of adjusted total debt to consolidated ebitda, each as defined in the credit facility) to not more than 4 to 1. our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. we currently satisfy the covenants in our credit facility and public debt instruments, including the leverage covenant under the credit facility, and do not expect that the covenants will restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future.
we believe the credit facility and our access to capital markets, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, remain adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, meet debt service, and fulfill other cash requirements.
we issue commercial paper in the united states. we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper; therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. we classify any outstanding commercial paper and credit facility borrowings as long-term based on our ability and intent to refinance them on a long-term basis. we reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. we do not expect that fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity, given our borrowing capacity under the credit facility.
at year-end 2015, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $1,158 million and reflected borrowing capacity of $1,062 million under our credit facility and our cash balance of $96 million. we calculated that borrowing capacity by taking $2,000 million of effective aggregate bank commitments under our credit facility and subtracting $938 million of outstanding commercial paper (there being no outstanding letters of credit under our credit facility).
we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. we expect to continue meeting part of our financing and liquidity needs primarily through commercial paper borrowings, issuances of senior notes, and access to long-term committed
credit facilities. if conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the capital markets take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of both the 2008 worldwide financial crisis and the events of september 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility, which we believe will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs, including repayment of debt obligations, but which may or may not carry a higher cost than commercial paper. since we continue to have ample flexibility under the credit facility's covenants, we expect that undrawn bank commitments under the credit facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly.
cash from operations cash from operations and non-cash items for the last three fiscal years are as follows:
non-cash items (1)           395                 328                 316
our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.4 to 1.0 at year-end 2015 and 0.5 to 1.0 at year-end 2014. we minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, and aggressive collection efforts. we also have significant borrowing capacity under our credit facility should we need additional working capital.
our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which we detail in exhibit 12 to this 2015 annual report on form 10-k, are as follows:
6.4x        6.2x        5.1x        4.6x        2.3x spin-off cash tax benefits tax matters that could affect our cash tax benefits related to the 2011 spin-off of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business were resolved in 2013. as we expected, the spin-off resulted in our realization through 2015 of approximately $480 million of cash tax benefits, relating to the value of the timeshare business. we realized $447 million of those benefits through 2014 and expect to realize approximately $33 million of cash tax benefits in 2015.
investing activities cash flows capital expenditures and other investments. we made capital expenditures of $305 million in 2015, $411 million in 2014, and $296 million in 2013. these included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, improvements to existing properties, and systems initiatives. capital expenditures in 2015 decreased by $106 million compared to 2014, primarily related to the 2014 development of two edition hotels, partially offset by 2015 renovations at a north american full-service property and investments in our reservations system. capital expenditures in 2014 increased by $115 million compared to 2013, primarily related to developing two edition hotels and our 2014 acquisition of an international property, partially offset by the completion of the london edition in the 2013 fourth quarter.
we expect 2016 investment spending will total approximately $450 million to $550 million, including approximately $100 million for maintenance capital spending. investment spending also includes other capital expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs, acquisitions, and equity and other investments. see our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for information on investment spending for 2015. our anticipated investment spending does not include additional investments we may make in connection with the starwood combination, which we expect will close in mid-2016, after customary conditions are satisfied, including shareholder approvals, required antitrust approvals, and the completion of starwood's previously announced spin-off of its vacation ownership business, or another spin-off, split-off, analogous disposition, or sale of its vacation ownership business. see footnote no. 3, "acquisitions and dispositions," for more information about the starwood combination.
over time, we have sold lodging properties, both completed and under development, subject to long-term management agreements. the ability of third-party purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations. we expect to continue making selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business, which may include loans and noncontrolling equity investments.
fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on our overall business results because: (1) we own less than one percent of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure.
dispositions. property and asset sales generated $673 million cash proceeds in 2015 and $435 million in 2014. see footnote no. 3, "acquisitions and dispositions," for more information on completed dispositions and planned dispositions.
loan activity. from time to time we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise. loan collections, net of loan advances, amounted to $26 million in 2015 compared to net advances of $69 million in 2014. at year-end 2015, we had a $3 million senior loan (current) and $218 million of mezzanine and other loans ($215 million noncurrent and $3 million current) outstanding, compared with a $3 million senior loan (current) and $239 million of mezzanine and other loans ($215 million noncurrent and $24 million current) outstanding at year-end 2014. in 2015, our notes receivable balance for senior, mezzanine, and other loans decreased by $21 million, primarily reflecting $86 million of collections on mvw notes receivable issued to us in 2011 in conjunction with our timeshare spin-off, partially offset by the issuance of the $58 million mezzanine loan (net of a $6 million discount) described in footnote no. 13, "notes receivable."
equity and cost method investments. cash outflows of $7 million in 2015, $6 million in 2014, and $16 million in 2013 for equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures.
cash from financing activities debt. debt increased by $336 million in 2015, to $4,107 million at year-end 2015 from $3,771 million at year-end 2014, and reflected $790 million ($800 million face amount) in series o and p notes issuances, partially offset by $314 million from the redemption of series g notes and a $134 million decrease in commercial paper borrowings. see footnote no. 10, "long-term debt" for additional information on the debt issuances.
our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt, and reducing our working capital. at year-end 2015, our long-term debt had an average interest rate of 2.9 percent and an average maturity of approximately 4.6 years. the ratio of our fixed-rate long-term debt to our total long-term debt was 0.8 to 1.0 at year-end 2015.

the preceding table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits at year-end 2015 of $24 million. see footnote no. 6, "income taxes" for additional information.
in addition to the purchase obligations noted in the preceding table, in the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of the hotels that we manage. since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow.
guarantee commitments the following table summarizes our guarantee commitments at year-end 2015:

for further information on our investment and loan commitments, including the nature of the commitments and their expirations, see the "commitments" caption in footnote no. 7, "commitments and contingencies."
letters of credit at year-end 2015, we also had $82 million of letters of credit outstanding (all outside the credit facility), the majority of which were for our self-insurance programs. surety bonds issued as of year-end 2015 totaled $159 million, the majority of which federal, state, and local governments requested in connection with our self-insurance programs.
related party transactions equity method investments we have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and/or franchise services and receive fees. we also have equity method investments in entities that provide management and/or franchise services to hotels and receive fees. in addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity, or guarantees to these entities.
for more information, including the impact to our financial statements of transactions with these related parties, see footnote no. 17, "related party transactions."
critical accounting policies and estimates our preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
while we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available at the time the estimate or assumption was made. actual results may differ significantly. additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors, and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them.
see footnote no. 2, "summary of significant accounting policies," for further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates, which are as follows:
goodwill, including how we evaluate the fair value of reporting units and when we record an impairment loss on goodwill;
loan loss reserves, including information on how we measure impairment on senior, mezzanine, and other loans of these types; and income taxes, including information on how we determine our current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

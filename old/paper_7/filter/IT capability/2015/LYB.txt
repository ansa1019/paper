item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
general this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements, and the accompanying notes elsewhere in this report. when we use the terms we, us, our or similar words in this discussion, unless the context otherwise requires, we are referring to lyondellbasell industries n.v. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
references to industry benchmark prices or costs, including the weighted average cost of ethylene production, are generally to industry prices and costs from third-party consulting data. references to industry benchmarks for refining and oxyfuels market margins are to industry prices reported by platts, a reporting service of the mcgraw-hill companies. references to industry benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas are to bloomberg.
overview our performance is driven by, among other things, global economic conditions generally and their impact on demand for our products, raw material and energy prices, as well as industry-specific issues, such as production capacity. our businesses are generally subject to the cyclicality and volatility seen in the chemicals and refining industries.
during 2015, we generated record earnings. our performance remained focused and steady despite the challenging environment of declining crude oil and natural gas prices. the impact of lower oil prices, which reduced the u.s. cost advantage for olefins and tba products, was offset by stronger polyolefins results in the u.s. and europe and in other businesses, such as styrene. lower prices for crude oil and correlated products also led to significant lower of cost or market inventory valuation charges during the year. we believe our performance indicates our capability to deliver strong results under a wide range of operating environments. during 2015, we continued to execute and expand our strategic growth program with expansions of our ethylene and pp compounds capacities. we also moved forward additional growth projects during the year.
significant items that affected 2015 results include:
   lower of cost or market (lcm) inventory valuation charges affecting all but the technology segment in 2015 totaling $548 million, pretax
   improved refining margins, offset by lower crude processing rates due primarily to unplanned maintenance in the latter part of the year at our houston refinery;
   steady intermediates and derivatives (i&amp;d) segment results reflecting higher styrene and ethylene oxide (eo) and derivatives results offset in part by lower results for the tba chain and acetyls; and
other noteworthy items during 2015 include the following:
        we completed a 250 million pounds per year ethylene expansion at our channelview, texas facility in the third quarter of 2015 and continued construction of an 800 million pounds per year ethylene expansion at our corpus christi, texas facility to be completed in the second quarter of 2016.
results of operations for the periods discussed in these results of operations are presented in the table below.
research and development expenses                            102                      127                      150
income from equity investments                               339                      257                      203
provision for income taxes                                 1,730                    1,540                    1,136
the decline in prices for crude oil and other feedstocks during 2015 was the primary contributing factor for lower average sales prices, which were responsible for 23% of the revenue decline in 2015 versus 2014. unfavorable translation impacts resulting from a significant decline in the euro/u.s. dollar exchange rate further reduced revenues by 5% during 2015.
sales volumes during 2015 were relatively unchanged from 2014. a decrease in sales due to lower crude processing rates in our refining segment was mostly offset by higher sales volumes for other products, including u.s. and european polyolefins in our o&pamericas and o&peai segments, respectively; and tba products, acetyls and styrene in our i&d segment.
crude processing rates at our houston refinery were negatively impacted in 2015 primarily as a result of unplanned maintenance outages during the last part of the year. strong 2015 demand for polyethylene and the completion of an expansion-related turnaround at our matagorda, texas facility in the first quarter of 2014 led to the higher u.s. polyethylene sales volumes in 2015. european polyolefins sales volumes increased relative to 2014 on higher demand. european polypropylene sales volumes also benefited from higher operating rates in 2015. tba product sales volumes benefited from, among other things, strong octane and gasoline demand and a tight market. an increase in methanol sales volumes due to higher operating rates and increased feedstock supply led to the higher acetyls sales volumes. increased operating rates and industry outages boosted sales volumes during 2015 for po & derivatives and eo and derivatives.
higher sales volumes for acetyls, styrene, po and derivatives and refined products, which were offset in part by lower volumes for u.s. olefins and eo and derivatives, contributed to 4% higher revenues in 2014 compared to 2013. higher acetyls sales volumes in 2014 benefited from the restart of our methanol plant at channelview, texas in december 2013. sales volumes for styrene improved in 2014 compared to 2013, which was affected by
planned maintenance activities in the u.s. and europe. industry outages in europe and asia in 2014 led to higher volumes for po and derivatives. an increase in sales volumes of refined products in 2014 reflects higher crude processing rates relative to 2013, which was negatively impacted by planned outages at our houston refinery. sales volumes for u.s. polyethylene were favorably affected by firm demand and the completion of an expansion and turnaround of our matagorda, texas polyethylene facility. these increases were offset in part by lower u.s. olefin sales volumes as 2014 volumes were impacted by an expansion-related turnaround at our la porte, texas facility. unplanned outages in 2014 resulted in lower eo and derivative volumes during that period.
in 2014, higher average sales prices for u.s. polyethylene, polypropylene (pp), pp compounds, po and derivatives, except butanediol (bdo), and vinyl acetate monomer (vam) were offset by lower average sales prices for european polyethylene, butanediol, oxyfuels, c4 chemicals and refining products.
increased demand and industry supply issues in 2014 led to the increase in u.s. polyethylene prices. the improvements in polypropylene prices reflected more favorable market conditions in 2014 versus 2013. global industry constraints and limited regional supply led to increased prices for vam and all of our po and derivatives products, except butanediol, which declined due to excess industry capacity in asia and the middle east. the lower average sales prices for oxyfuels in 2014 reflected the impact of lower brent crude oil and gasoline prices, which was partially offset by a higher octane blending premium. in 2014, the decline in c4 chemicals prices was driven by the lower energy profile, while the average sales prices for refining products reflected the decline in crude oil prices during the fourth quarter of 2014.
cost of sales in 2015 includes pre-tax charges totaling $548 million for noncash lcm inventory valuation adjustments in all of our segments except technology. these adjustments were driven mainly by declines in the prices for crude oil, ethylene, propylene, benzene and etbe. during 2015, cost of sales also includes $35 million of amortization expense associated with the expiration of emission allowance credits in our refining and i&d segments. cost of sales in 2014 included a $760 million charge related to an lcm inventory valuation adjustment driven by a decline in feedstock prices in our o&pamericas segment and a $52 million benefit in our o&peai segment associated with a settlement for certain existing and future environmental claims under a 2005 indemnification agreement.
the decrease in cost of sales in 2015 was primarily due to lower feedstock costs. in 2015, the raw material costs for heavy liquids and natural gas liquids (ngls) used in our o&pamericas segment; naphtha and other feedstocks and propylene used in our o&peai segment; benzene, propylene, butane, ethylene and ethanol used in our i&d segment; and crude oil used in our refining segment were significantly lower relative to 2014.
2014 versus 2013cost of sales increased by $999 million in 2014 compared to 2013. non-cash, lcm charges related to inventories in all but our technology segment were responsible for $760 million of the $999 million increase in cost of sales. these charges, which were recognized in the third and fourth quarters of 2014, were primarily driven by declines in the prices of crude oil and products derived from or correlated to crude oil.
2015 versus 2014operating income increased by $386 million in 2015, which includes the impact of the $548 million lcm inventory valuation adjustment and the emission credit allowances amortization discussed above.
absent the lcm inventory valuation adjustments in 2015 and 2014, the amortization associated with the expiration of emission credit allowances in 2015 and the benefit from the environmental settlement in 2014, operating income was higher by $261 million in 2015, compared to 2014. the improvement in results was primarily driven by the operations of our o&peai and refining segments. the primary drivers of the improvement in operating income were higher margins that benefited from lower feedstock costs and improved supply/demand fundamentals in our european olefins and polyolefins businesses. higher refining margins also contributed to the increases in operating income. improvements in polyolefins margins in our o&pamericas segment added to these increases in 2015; however, lower olefin margins in that segment primarily driven by lower ethylene prices more than offset the polyolefins margin benefit. improved styrene and eo and derivatives margins in our i&d segment, which also added to the improvement in operating income, were substantially offset by lower margins for tba products and acetyls.
2014 versus 2013operating income increased by $634 million in 2014, which includes the impact of the $760 million lcm inventory valuation adjustment discussed above. this increase primarily reflects the impact of the higher sales volumes discussed above and margins that benefited from lower feedstock costs.
apart from the lcm adjustment, margins were higher in 2014 across all businesses in our o&pamericas and o&peai segments, for po and derivatives, acetyls and oxyfuels in our i&d segment and for refining products in our refining segment. these higher margins were offset in part by lower margins for c4 chemicals, styrene and eo and derivatives in our i&d segment. our higher margins generally reflected our lower cost of ethylene production and the lower cost of crude oil, but in some cases were driven by average sales prices that increased relative to the related feedstock costs. lower margins for styrene and eo and derivatives reflected lower average sales prices compounded by higher feedstock costs and the lower c4 chemicals margins are attributed to falling energy prices.
operating results for each of our business segments are reviewed further in the segment analysis section below.
2015 versus 2014the decrease in interest expense in 2015 relative to 2014 was primarily due to favorable impacts of $85 million related to our fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps. this decrease was offset in part by higher interest charges related to the issuance of our 4.875% guaranteed notes due 2044 in february 2014 and our 4.625% senior notes due 2055 in march 2015.
2014 versus 2013the increase in interest expense in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to interest related to the july 2013 issuances of our 4% guaranteed notes due 2023 and 5.25% guaranteed notes due 2043 and the february 2014 issuance of our 4.875% guaranteed notes due 2044. these increases were partially offset by a $28 million net favorable adjustment related to our fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps.
see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps.
income from equity investmentsour income from equity investments was $339 million in 2015, $257 million in 2014 and $203 million in 2013.
2015 versus 2014our 2015 income from equity investments increased by $82 million over 2014 largely due to improved margins in certain joint ventures as a result of favorable market prices during 2015 and strong operating rates.
2014 versus 2013income from equity investments increased by $54 million over 2013. this improvement includes higher margins for some of our joint ventures in the middle east, europe and asia, the impact of better operating rates at two of our joint ventures in asia and one of our joint ventures in the middle east that experienced significant unplanned maintenance in 2013. in 2014, an improved supply of feedstock at one our asian joint ventures also contributed to the higher operating rates relative to 2013.
income taxesour effective income tax rates of 27.9% in 2015, 27.0% in 2014 and 22.7% in 2013 resulted in tax provisions of $1,730 million, $1,540 million and $1,136 million, respectively. our effective income tax rate fluctuates based on, among other factors, changes in pretax income in countries with varying statutory tax rates, the u.s. domestic production activity deduction, changes in valuation allowances, changes in foreign exchange gains/losses, the amount of exempt income, and changes in unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions. the companys exempt income primarily includes interest income and equity earnings of joint ventures. the interest income is earned by certain of our european subsidiaries through intercompany financings and is either untaxed or taxed at rates substantially lower than the u.s. statutory rate. the equity earnings are attributable to our joint ventures and these earnings when paid (dividended) to certain european subsidiaries are eligible for participation exemptions, which exempt the dividend payments from all or portions of normal statutory income tax rates. we currently anticipate the favorable treatment for the interest income and dividends to continue in the near term; however, this treatment is based on current law and tax rulings, which could change. the foreign exchange gains/losses have a permanent impact on our effective income tax rate that can cause unpredictable movement in our effective income tax rate. we continue to maintain valuation allowances in various jurisdictions totaling $125 million, which could impact our effective tax rate in the future.
2015the 2015 effective income tax rate, which was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate of 35%, was favorably impacted by exempt income, earnings in various countries with lower statutory tax rates, (notably in europe) and the u.s. domestic production activity deduction. these favorable items were partially offset by the effects of u.s. state and local income taxes.
2014the 2014 effective income tax rate, which was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate of 35%, was favorably impacted by exempt income, the u.s. domestic production activity deduction, foreign exchange losses, and earnings in various countries with lower statutory tax rates, (notably in europe). these favorable items were partially offset by the effects of u.s. state and local income taxes.
2013the 2013 effective income tax rate, which was lower than the u.s. statutory tax rate of 35%, was favorably impacted by the release of certain valuation allowances, exempt income, the u.s. domestic production activity deduction, and earnings in various countries with lower statutory tax rates (notably in europe), partially offset by the effects of u.s. state and local taxes and foreign exchange gains. in 2013, we released valuation allowances primarily associated with tax losses in our french tax group resulting in an overall benefit of $353 million.
for further information related to our income taxes, see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
2015 versus 2014in 2015, comprehensive income increased on higher net income, the reduction in actuarial losses related to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized in 2015, the favorable impact of unrealized net changes in foreign currency translation adjustments and to a lesser extent, the benefit of favorable financial derivative adjustments.
in 2015 and 2014, we recognized net actuarial losses of $8 million and $493 million, respectively. the $493 million net loss in the prior year was caused primarily by pension and other postretirement benefit discount rate decreases and mortality assumption changes. in 2015, the $8 million net loss was primarily attributable to $133 million of actual asset return less than the expected return. this loss was offset by gains due to $73 million of discount rate increases and, $50 million of gains due to favorable liability experience and healthcare assumptions.
the predominant functional currency for our operations outside of the u.s. is the euro. relative to the u.s. dollar, the value of the euro decreased during 2015 and 2014, resulting in losses as reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
2014 versus 2013comprehensive income decreased by $1,312 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to foreign currency translation losses and actuarial losses related to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that were recognized during the period. these losses were offset in part by the increase in 2014 net income over 2013. the predominant functional currency for our operations outside of the u.s. is the euro. relative to the u.s. dollar, the value of the euro decreased in 2014 versus 2013, resulting in foreign currency translation losses, which decreased comprehensive income by $958 million. in 2014, we recognized net actuarial losses of $493 million, which compares to a net actuarial gain of $411 million recognized in 2013. this $904 million decline in 2014 reflects $663 million related to discount rate assumption changes and other immaterial liability experience gains and losses and $241 million primarily related to actual asset return in excess of the expected return compared to 2013.
see critical accounting policies below and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the key assumptions included in calculating the discount rate and expected return on plan assets.
segment analysis we use earnings before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (ebitda) as our measure of profitability for segment reporting purposes. this measure of segment operating results is used by our chief operating decision maker to assess the performance of and allocate resources to our operating segments. intersegment eliminations and items that are not directly related or allocated to business operations are included in other. for additional information related to our operating segments, as well as a reconciliation of ebitda to its nearest generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) measure, income from continuing operations before income taxes, see note 22, segment and related information, to our consolidated financial statements.
our continuing operations are divided into five reportable segments: o&pamericas; o&peai; i&d; refining; and technology. the following tables reflect selected financial information for our reportable segments.
technology segment                                        465                      497                      532

olefins and polyolefinsamericas segment overviewin calculating the impact of margin and volume on ebitda, consistent with industry practice, management offsets revenues and volumes related to ethylene co-products against the cost to produce ethylene. volume and price impacts of ethylene co-products are reported in margin. ethylene is a major building block of our olefins and polyolefins businesses and as such management assesses the performance of the segment based on ethylene sales volumes and prices and our internal cost of ethylene production.
2015 versus 2014segment results were lower in 2015 primarily due to a decline in olefins results partially offset by improved polyolefin results relative to 2014. olefins results in 2015 reflect lower margins, offset in part by higher sales volumes due partly to the completion of an 800 million pound ethylene expansion at our la porte, texas facility in september 2014. the decrease in olefins margins was driven by the decline in u.s. ethylene prices due to the impact of lower oil prices on global ethylene markets and increased u.s. ethylene supply. margin improvements and higher sales volumes in 2015 led to the increased polyethylene and polypropylene results over 2014.
margins in our olefins business in 2015 continued to benefit from low-cost ethylene produced from ngls in north america, but to a lesser extent than in 2014 and 2013. the cost advantage for this ethylene, compared to that produced from naphtha and other crude oil-based liquids in the rest of the world, declined due to the lower crude oil prices in 2015. higher u.s. polyethylene margins and volumes reflected continued strong global market conditions. polypropylene margins expanded on significant strengthening of supply/demand balances.
prices for heavy liquids, ngls and olefins have declined significantly since the third quarter of 2014 to levels that have not been seen in recent years. these declines resulted in the recognition of the non-cash, lcm inventory adjustments totaling $279 million in 2014 discussed below. volatility in the benchmark prices for heavy liquids and natural gas and certain correlated products, particularly ethylene and propylene, which continued during most of 2015, led to net non-cash lcm inventory valuation adjustments totaling $548 million during 2015.
2014 versus 2013segment results were higher in 2014, primarily due to improved polyethylene and olefins results and, to a lesser extent, better polypropylene margins. margin improvements and an increase in 2014 sales volumes contributed to the improved polyethylene results over 2013. our 2014 olefins results reflected higher margins relative to 2013, offset in part by a decrease in sales volumes from the outage at our la porte, texas facility prior to the completion of the ethylene expansion discussed above. our segment results were negatively impacted by a $279 million non-cash, lcm inventory valuation adjustment, most of which was recognized in the fourth quarter.
as mentioned above, the significant decline in prices for heavy liquids, ngls and olefins in december 2014 to levels lower than the carrying value of our related inventories as of december 31, 2014 required us to record the lcm inventory valuation adjustment discussed above.
ethylene raw materialsbenchmark crude oil and natural gas prices generally have been indicators of the level and direction of the movement of raw material and energy costs for ethylene and its co-products in the o&pamericas segment. ethylene and its co-products are produced from two major raw material groups:
although prices of these raw materials are generally related to crude oil and natural gas prices, during specific periods the relationships among these materials and benchmarks may vary significantly. in the u.s., we have significant capability to change the mix of raw materials used in the production of ethylene and its co-products to take advantage of the relative costs of heavy liquids and ngls.
production economics for the industry have favored ngls in recent years. although the decline in oil prices significantly reduced the cost of ethylene produced from heavy liquids in 2015, ngl prices also declined and they continued to be preferred feedstocks. approximately 90% of our u.s. ethylene production was produced from ngls during the past three years.
the following table shows the average u.s. benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas for the applicable periods, as well as benchmark u.s. sales prices for ethylene and propylene, which we produce and sell or consume internally. the table also shows the discounted u.s. benchmark prices for certain polyethylene and polypropylene products. these industry benchmark prices are third party estimates that are indicative of contract sales for some key product grades, but do not necessarily describe price trends for our full olefins or polymers product mixes. the benchmark weighted average cost of ethylene production, which reflects credits for co-product sales, is based on a third party consultants estimated ratio of heavy liquid raw materials and ngls used in u.s. ethylene production.

2015 versus 2014average sales prices declined for most products in 2015 resulting in a 31% revenue decrease compared to 2014. lower average olefin prices reflect the significant decline in prices for crude oil and correlated products relative to prices in 2014. the decline in average polyethylene and polypropylene sales prices followed the decline in the 2015 prices of their respective feedstocks, ethylene and propylene.
these decreases in revenues were offset in part by an increase in sales volumes, which gave rise to a 2% revenue increase in 2015, compared to 2014. ethylene sales volumes were higher due to increased production reflecting higher capacity following the completion of the expansion-related turnaround at our la porte, texas facility during 2014 and additional production related to less planned and unplanned downtime at our channelview, texas facility. polyethylene sales volumes improved in 2015, due to the completion of an expansion-related turnaround at our matagorda, texas facility in the first quarter of 2014 and continued healthy global demand. polypropylene sales volumes, which were limited by production in both years, increased slightly in 2015 relative to 2014.
2014 versus 2013the $859 million increase in revenues in 2014 was the result of an improvement in average sales prices and increased sales volumes, which accounted for 6% and 1%, respectively, of the increase over 2013. average sales prices in 2014 increased across most products, particularly polyethylene. higher average polyethylene prices in 2014 reflected increased demand and industry supply issues in the ethylene and polyethylene markets. average polypropylene prices also improved in 2014, reflecting a market environment that was more favorable than in 2013.
the increase in sales volumes in 2014 was primarily due to higher polyethylene sales volumes offset in part by a decrease in ethylene volumes. the increase in polyethylene sales volumes reflected the completion of an expansion-related turnaround at our matagorda, texas facility in the early part of 2014 and strong industry demand. firm market demand throughout 2014 also contributed to the increase in polyethylene sales volumes over 2013. ethylene volumes were negatively impacted by production constraints as a result of the turnaround at our la porte, texas facility during 2014. polypropylene sales volumes were relatively unchanged between the 2014 and 2013 periods.
ebitdaebitda decreased by $250 million, or 6%, in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased by $338 million, or 9%, in 2014 compared to 2013.
2015 versus 2014the 6% decrease in ebitda reflects a 24% net margin decline due to lower olefin margins, offset in part by a 14% increase related to higher volumes and a 3% increase related to the $119 million decline in the non-cash charges related to the lcm inventory valuation adjustments discussed above. improvements in our income from equity investments accounts for the remaining 1% increase in ebitda during 2015.
the impact of significantly lower ethylene margins in 2015 was offset in part by increases in polyethylene and polypropylene margins compared to 2014. olefin margins declined in 2015 as the average sales price of ethylene was driven down by the decline of naphtha feedstock prices, which generally trend with crude oil prices, and by improved market supply due to an improvement in industry operating rates and additional market capacity. a decrease in our cost of ethylene production partially offset the impact of the decline in ethylene sales price in 2015 lessening the impact of lower margins during the year. lower ngl and heavy liquids feedstock prices in 2015 outpaced the decline in selling prices of our co-products, which resulted in the decrease of our cost of ethylene production compared to the prior year.
polyethylene margins improved in 2015 as demand remained strong and decreases in the cost of ethylene feedstock more than offset lower average sales prices relative to 2014. polypropylene margins, which increased in 2015, benefited from lower propylene feedstock costs, which in part reflect the decline in crude oil prices, and higher average sales prices relative to propylene, driven by industry operating issues and increased demand.
sales volumes in 2015 increased as compared to the prior year as a result of downtime and expansion-related activities in 2014 and the increased demand discussed above.
2014 versus 2013the 9% improvement in ebitda during 2014 reflects a 19% increase related to higher margins which was offset in part by a 2% decrease related to volumes and an 8% decrease related to the $279 million lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment discussed above.
margins improved across all products, especially for olefins and polyethylene. the combination of higher ethylene sales prices discussed above, the lower cost of ngls and heavy liquids, and higher co-product credits resulted in an improvement in olefins margins in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in 2014 polyethylene margins reflect higher average sales prices as discussed above offset in part by increases in ethylene feedstock costs. polypropylene margins also improved in 2014 due to the continued strength in pricing that carried over from late 2013.
the decrease in ebitda attributable to the lower volumes reflects a decline in olefins volumes which was partially offset by increased polyethylene volumes.
olefins and polyolefinseurope, asia, international segment overview
2015 versus 2014operating results in 2015 reflect improved results for our european polyolefins business and, to a lesser extent, higher results for our olefins business and better results for our joint ventures that are accounted for using the equity method. polyethylene and polypropylene margins improved due to supply constraints as a result of several industry outages and the benefit of a lower price position compared to other regions resulting from the weakness in the euro. an increase in 2015 sales volumes also contributed to the higher polyethylene and polypropylene results relative to 2014. olefins margins improved in 2015 as the lower cost of ethylene production, which was driven by lower feedstock prices, outpaced the decline in olefin product prices. margins benefited for most of 2015 from a lag between declining feedstock costs and product prices. turnaround activities at our münchsmünster, germany facility and unplanned outages resulted in a decrease in olefins sales volumes in 2015 relative to 2014.
at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, lower feedstock and product prices resulted in market prices that were lower than the carrying value of our related inventories. accordingly, we recorded a $30 million non-cash, lcm inventory valuation charge related to our olefins and polyolefins businesses. this compares to the $44 million non-cash, lcm inventory valuation charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 discussed below.
2014 versus 2013operating results in 2014 reflect improved results for our olefins and european polyolefins businesses and, to a lesser extent, better results for our joint ventures that are accounted for using the equity method. improvements in margins and operating rates, which surpassed european average industry rates, contributed to the higher olefins results in 2014. higher polyolefins results in 2014 reflected improved margins versus 2013 and increased polyethylene volumes. although market conditions for european producers remained highly competitive, the increase in european demand for polyolefins was consistent with the modest overall economic recovery that was evidenced in the region.
in the fourth quarter of 2014, the declining price of naphtha resulted in a market price lower than the carrying value of our related inventory necessitating the recognition of a $44 million non-cash, lcm inventory valuation charge related to our olefins business. despite this charge, our fourth quarter results remained consistent with our prior quarterly results during 2014. the fall of our product prices lagged behind the decline in feedstock prices throughout the latter part of 2014.
ethylene raw materialsin europe, heavy liquids are the primary raw materials for our ethylene production. in periods during 2015 not affected by turnaround activities, we increased the consumption of feedstocks other than naphtha, such as propane, butane and condensates, in our production process. the prices for these other feedstocks have been subject to declines that were at times of the same or greater magnitude as the declines in the crude oil prices.
the following table shows the average western europe benchmark prices for brent crude oil for the applicable periods, as well as benchmark western europe prices for ethylene and propylene, which we produce and consume internally or purchase from unrelated suppliers, and discounted prices for certain polyethylene and polypropylene products. these industry benchmark prices are third party estimates that are indicative of contract sales for some key product grades, but do not necessarily describe price trends for our full olefins or polymers product mixes.

the following table sets forth selected financial information for the o&peai segment including income from equity investments, which is a component of ebitda.
income from equity investments                   283                     229                   174

2015 versus 2014the decline in 2015 revenues reflects decreases of 14% and 12% related to lower average sales prices and currency translation impacts, respectively. an increase in polyolefins volumes, which was substantially offset by a decline in olefins volumes stemming from turnaround activities and unplanned outages, was responsible for a 2% revenue increase in 2015.
in 2015, lower average sales prices for polypropylene and pp compounds were partially offset by higher average polyethylene prices. decreases in feedstock costs in 2015 led to the decline in polypropylene and pp compounds sales prices compared to 2014. the increase in polyethylene prices in 2015 reflect strong spread increases over ethylene, primarily in europe.
higher polyethylene sales volumes reflect an increase in demand for our high density polyethylene as well as higher operating rates in 2015. increased demand and an improvement in operating rates led to the increase in 2015 polypropylene sales volumes over 2014. sale volumes for pp compounds increased in 2015 due to higher demand in the automotive industry. lower production from our crackers related to turnaround activities during 2015 resulted in the decrease in olefins sales volumes.
2014 versus 2013the increase in 2014 revenues comprises a 2% increase related to higher sales volumes and a 2% increase from higher average sales prices. improved operations of our crackers in 2014 versus 2013 resulted in higher output, which led to increased olefins sales volumes. higher polyethylene sales volumes reflect an increase in our low density polyethylene production capacity relative to 2013 due to operational issues during that time. polypropylene sales volumes declined in 2014 largely due to lower output related to turnaround activities at one of our joint ventures during the first quarter of 2014 and the closure of our clyde production facility in australia in late 2013.
in 2014, improvements in the average sales prices for polypropylene and pp compounds were partially offset by a decline in average polyethylene prices. increases in feedstock costs in 2014 led to the higher polypropylene and pp compounds sales prices compared to 2013. the lower polyethylene prices in 2014 reflected a decline in ethylene feedstock costs, primarily in europe.
ebitdaebitda increased by $459 million, or 34%, in 2015 compared to 2014 and by $527 million, or 63%, in 2014 compared to 2013.
2015 versus 2014the 34% improvement in 2015 ebitda reflects a 42% increase related to margins, a 4% increase related to higher volumes and an additional 4% increase stemming from improvements in income from our equity investments. these increases were partially offset by a 13% decrease due to the translation of a weaker euro and a 3% decrease related to a net charge of $38 million discussed below. in 2015, ebitda included a $30 million charge related to lcm adjustments driven by a decline in naphtha prices and polyolefins prices. in 2014, ebitda included a $52 million benefit associated with a settlement for certain existing and future environmental claims under a 2005 indemnification agreement from an insurance settlement, which was offset in part by a $44 million charge related to an lcm adjustment driven by a decline in naphtha prices.
the increase in 2015 results was mainly driven by better results for european polyolefins and olefins compared to 2014. polyethylene results improved during 2015 on higher spreads, primarily due to a decline in ethylene feedstock costs and on increased sales volume, as discussed above. polypropylene results increased in 2015 over the corresponding prior year period due to margin improvements from higher spreads and increased volumes, as discussed above. higher olefins results reflect margin improvements, partly offset by a decline in volumes due to turnaround activity. improved olefin margins reflect mid-year supply constraints due to industry outages, the decline in naphtha feedstock prices during the second half of 2015 and increased consumption of advantaged feedstocks in the first half of 2015.
the higher contribution to our results by certain of our joint ventures, which is reflected in income from equity investments in 2015, is mainly driven by improved margins compared to 2014 in certain joint ventures as a result of favorable market prices during 2015 and strong operating rates.
2014 versus 2013the 63% improvement in 2014 ebitda included a 51% increase related to margins, a 7% increase related to higher volumes and a 7% increase related to improvements in income from our equity investments. these increases were partially offset by a 2% decrease related to a net charge of $17 million discussed below. in 2014, ebitda included a $52 million benefit associated with a settlement for certain existing and future environmental claims under a 2005 indemnification agreement from an insurance settlement, which was offset in part by a $44 million charge related to an lcm adjustment driven by a decline in naphtha prices. in 2013, ebitda included a $25 million benefit from an insurance settlement related to the damage to our ldpe plant described below.
the increase in 2014 results was mainly driven by improvements in earnings for olefins and european polyolefins compared to 2013. higher olefins results reflect margin improvements and the impact of increased volumes discussed above. olefin margins improved primarily due to the combination of the decline in naphtha feedstock prices during the second half of 2014, higher consumption of advantaged feedstocks and increased propylene sales prices driven by tightness in the european market. polyethylene results improved during 2014 on increased sales volume, as discussed above, and on higher spreads, primarily due to a decline in ethylene feedstock costs. polypropylene results increased in 2014 over the corresponding prior year period as the margin improvements from higher spreads more than offset the impact of the decline in volumes discussed above.
the higher contribution to our results by certain of our joint ventures, which is reflected in income from equity investments in 2014, is mainly driven by improved margins compared to 2013 as a result of favorable market price developments during 2014.
intermediates and derivatives segment overview
2015 versus 2014results in 2015 reflect improvements in our styrene business and, to a lesser extent, our ethylene oxide and derivatives business, offset in part by lower results for our oxyfuels and c4 chemicals (tba products) and acetyls businesses. stronger margins resulting from favorable product pricing and declining benzene and ethylene feedstock costs led to the improved styrene results. the decline in the 2015 results for acetyls and tba products reflected a decrease in methanol prices due to increased industry supply and lower energy prices, respectively, compared to 2014 which reflected unusually high tba product margins.
our 2015 results were also unfavorably impacted by non-cash, lcm inventory valuation adjustments. the continued decline in benzene, etbe and feedstock prices to levels that were lower than the carrying value of our related inventories at reporting dates throughout the year necessitated the recognition of $181 million of lcm inventory valuation adjustments in 2015, an $88 million increase over the lcm inventory valuation adjustment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014.
2014 versus 2013operating results for our i&d segment reflected a slight decline in 2014 compared to 2013 due to a $93 million non-cash, lcm inventory valuation adjustment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014. this adjustment was a result of the decline of prices for oxyfuels and the raw materials used to produce oxyfuels that fell to levels that were lower than the carrying value of our related inventories at december 31, 2014.
absent this inventory valuation adjustment, results reflected improvements in acetyls and po and derivatives that were offset in part by lower results for styrene, ethylene oxide/ethylene glycol (eo/eg), and the tba chains. the increase in acetyls results was primarily driven by the restart of the channelview, texas methanol unit in december 2013. industry outages and the delay of announced capacity additions contributed to the improvement in po and derivatives results in 2014. in 2014, styrene results fell below 2013 results due to excess supply and higher feedstock prices compared to 2013. unplanned maintenance in the last half of the year contributed to the decrease in our eo/eg results in 2014. the decrease in our tba chain results reflected the impact of lower oxyfuels sales volumes that was partially offset by slightly better margins.
the following table sets forth selected financial information for the i&d segment including income from equity investments, which is a component of ebitda. in addition, the table shows methyl tertiary butyl ether (mtbe) margins in northwest europe (nwe).

revenuesrevenues for 2015 decreased by $2,358 million, or 23%, compared to 2014 and increased by $658 million, or 7%, in 2014 compared to 2013.
2015 versus 2014the decrease in 2015 revenues reflects a decline in average sales prices for most products and a significantly weaker euro against the u.s. dollar, partly offset by higher sales volumes relative to the prior year. the declines in average sales prices and the currency translation impacts led to revenue decreases of 23% and 6%, respectively. these negative impacts were reduced by a 6% revenue increase related to higher sales volumes for our tba, acetyls, po and derivatives, styrene and eo and derivatives businesses.
in 2015, the significant decline in crude oil and other key feedstocks prices was the primary driver behind the overall decrease in average sales prices across most businesses. the impact of industry supply constraints in several businesses, principally styrene and eo/eg, due to planned and unplanned outages slowed the impact of falling prices; however, average sales prices fell below 2014 levels. this decline in prices was offset in part by tba product octane blend premiums and gasoline price spreads over crude oil that were strong in 2015.
tba product sales volumes increased due to strong octane and gasoline demand. higher sales of purchased material and the reduction of inventory levels also contributed to this increase in sales volumes. increased feedstock supply and an improvement in operating rates led to the increase in 2015 methanol sales volumes. operating rates were higher in 2015 despite planned outages at our channelview, texas po/sm plant and our po / tba plant at fos sur mer, france. these higher operating rates, which reflected strong global demand and the impact of industry outages, led to an increase in po & derivatives and styrene sales volumes. industry outage and higher operating rates contributed to the increased sales volumes for eo and derivatives.
higher sales volumes for acetyls, styrene and po were offset in part by a decline in eo and derivatives and oxyfuels sales volumes. the 2014 increase in acetyls sales volumes was mainly driven by the december 2013 restart of our methanol plant in channelview, texas. sales volumes for styrene were higher in 2014 as volumes in 2013 were negatively impacted by planned plant outages at our channelview, texas and maasvlakte, the netherlands facilities, which limited production capacity during that period. po sales volumes increased in 2015 largely due to industry outages in asia and europe in 2014. due to unplanned outages at our bayport, texas facility in 2014, available production capacity was limited, which resulted in lower eo derivatives volumes compared to 2013. planned and unplanned production constraints in 2014 were also responsible for lower oxyfuels volumes compared to 2013.
in 2014, higher average sales prices for po and derivatives and vam were partially offset by declines in the average sales prices for oxyfuels and c4 chemicals in 2014 compared to 2013. global industry supply constraints and limited regional supply capacity led to higher prices for po and derivatives as well as vam in 2014 compared 2013. tba product sales prices declined in 2014 relative to 2013 with lower crude oil and gasoline prices, which were partially mitigated by an increase in the octane blend premium. octane blend premiums remained strong in 2014, primarily due to industry supply constraints and regionally strong blending demand.
ebitdaebitda increased by $16 million, or 1%, in 2015 compared to 2014 and decreased by $33 million, or 2%, in 2014 compared to 2013.
2015 versus 2014the 1% increase in ebitda during 2015 reflects increases of 7% related to higher volumes and 1% related to improvements in income from our equity investments. these improvements were substantially offset by decreases of 6% related to the $88 million incremental increase in the non-cash lcm inventory valuation adjustment recognized in 2015 over 2014 and by a 1% decrease related to lower margins in 2015.
segment results in 2015 reflect better results for styrene and eo and derivatives, partly offset by lower results for our tba chain and acetyls.
higher styrene results in 2015 reflect significant margin improvements driven by tight supply resulting from industry outages and by benzene and ethylene feedstock prices that declined more rapidly than the average sales price of styrene. results also benefited from increased sales volumes stemming from stronger market demand, industry outages and higher operating rates compared to 2014.
ethylene oxide and derivative results were higher in 2015 relative to 2014, reflecting margin improvements and increased sales volumes. despite a decline in product prices, margins improved as the ethylene feedstock prices declined more rapidly than the decline in average sales prices. ethylene oxide volumes increased in 2015 compared to 2014, which was negatively impacted by constrained production due to turnaround activities.
results for the tba chain declined in 2015 reflecting lower margins offset in part by an increase in sales volumes as discussed above. a significant decline in crude oil prices, which was partly offset by strong gasoline price spreads over crude oil and octane blending value, led to a decrease in tba product margins.
acetyls results declined in 2015 relative to 2014 as lower margins were offset in part by increased sales volumes despite turnaround activities at our la porte, texas facility in the latter part of the year. the decrease in acetyls margins reflects a decline of methanol prices due to new industry supply and falling energy prices, partially offset by lower natural gas prices.
2014 versus 2013ebitda decreased in 2014 as a result of the $93 million lcm inventory valuation adjustment in 2014 related to our oxyfuels business, which represented a 6% decrease in ebitda compared to 2013. the impact of this charge was offset in part by a 2% increase in ebitda related to 2013 charges totaling $26 million associated with the sale of our investment in nihon oxirane company discussed below. in addition to these items, a 10% increase in ebitda related to higher volumes was offset in part by a decrease of 8% related to lower margins.
apart from the one-time items discussed above, our 2014 results reflected improvements in po and derivatives and acetyls, partially offset by lower results for oxyfuels, c4 chemicals, styrene and eo/eg compared to 2013.
improved po and derivatives results for 2014 benefitted from asian start-up delays, industry outages and european industry supply interruptions. these global factors collectively led to higher po sales volumes and increases in average sales prices in 2014 compared to 2013. in addition, po and derivatives, particularly propylene glycols, benefited from the unusually cold weather in early 2014 compared to 2013.
higher acetyls results in 2014 predominantly reflected higher methanol volumes due to the restart of our methanol plant in channelview, texas in december 2013 combined with improved vam driven by industry outages and a reduction in overall market supply compared to 2013. although operational issues during 2014 limited the benefit derived from the restart of our methanol plant discussed above, the plant added approximately 180 million gallons to the overall results during that period. improved vam margins in 2014, as increases in average sales prices were partly offset by higher feedstock costs, also contributed to the higher acetyls results compared to 2013.
the lower oxyfuels results were mostly due to decreases in sales volumes in 2014 as a result of planned and unplanned outages discussed above. margins improved moderately in 2014 compared to 2013 as lower brent crude oil and gasoline prices were more than offset by the improved spread between gasoline and crude oil, stronger octane blend premiums and lower feedstock prices. margins were also negatively impacted by a shift in the level of sales between regions; in addition, c4 chemicals results declined on falling energy prices.
the decline in styrene results in 2014 compared to 2013 was attributed to lower margins that were partially offset by the impact of the increase in sales volumes discussed above. styrene margins decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower average sales prices, reflecting weak demand and excess capacity, and higher benzene and ethylene feedstock prices.
refining segment overviewthe refining segment comprises the operations of our full conversion refinery located on the houston ship channel in houston, texas.
2015 versus 2014the results of our refining segment in 2015 were impacted by non-cash charges totaling $177 million related to lcm inventory valuation adjustments to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to market value at our third and fourth quarter reporting dates. these charges, which resulted from a near $20 barrel decline in crude oil prices since the end of 2014 and corresponding reductions in refined product prices, were $167 million less than the lcm inventory valuation adjustment recorded in 2014.
fourth quarter 2015 results declined significantly compared to the results in the prior three quarters of 2015 as refinery operating rates were significantly lower due to unplanned maintenance outages. the recognition of a $127 million non-cash, lcm inventory valuation adjustment resulted in a loss for the fourth quarter.
excluding the impacts of the lcm inventory valuation adjustments recognized in both years, segment results for 2015 increased over 2014 as improvements in refining margins were largely driven by higher by-product price spreads over crude oil due to the drop in crude oil prices and increased purchases of crude oil at advantaged prices.
2014 versus 2013the results of our refining segment in 2014 were significantly impacted by a year-end, non-cash charge of $344 million to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to market value at december 31, 2014. this inventory valuation charge was predicated on a near $50 per barrel decline in crude oil prices since the third quarter of 2014 and corresponding reductions in refined product prices.
fourth quarter 2014 results were markedly lower than results in the prior three quarters of 2014 as refined product margins contracted, and the recognition of the lcm inventory valuation adjustment resulted in a loss for the quarter. excluding this charge, 2014 segment ebitda reflected an increase over 2013 as refining margins improved, operating rates were higher, and costs for renewable identification numbers, a u.s. government established credit used to show compliance in meeting the environmental protection agencys renewable fuel standard, declined by $20 million.
the following table sets forth selected financial information and heavy crude processing rates for the refining segment and the u.s. refining market margins for the applicable periods. lls is a light crude oil, while maya is a heavy crude oil.
ebitda                                                                     342                    65                   182

market margins, dollars per barrel light crude oil2-1-1                                                   $14.04                $13.32                $12.89
revenuesrevenues decreased by $5,153 million, or 44% in 2015 compared to 2014 and were nearly unchanged in 2014 compared to 2013.
2015 versus 2014total revenues decreased on significantly lower product prices due to the drop in crude oil prices and a reduction in sales volumes due to production limitations. the average crude oil price in 2015 declined by slightly over $40 per barrel compared to 2014 leading to lower product pricing. this decline in product pricing caused a 38% decrease in revenues compared to 2014. processing rates in 2015 reflect an 8% decrease from 2014 rates, driven by processing limits which were negatively impacted primarily by unplanned maintenance in the fourth quarter of 2015. this decline contributed to a 6% decrease in 2015 revenues.
2014 versus 2013the increase in total revenues reflected increased sales volume, which were nearly offset by lower product prices. sales volumes increased 8% in 2014 relative to 2013 on the benefit of near capacity crude processing rates during most of the year. processing rates in 2014 reflect a 12% improvement over rates in 2013, which were negatively impacted by planned and unplanned maintenance. this increase was offset by a nearly 8% decrease in revenues driven by lower refined product prices attributable to a drop in crude oil prices in 2014.
ebitdaebitda increased by $277 million, or 426%, in 2015 compared to 2014 and decreased by $117 million, or 64%, in 2014 compared to 2013.
2015 versus 2014the $177 million lcm inventory valuation adjustment in 2015 was significantly less than the $344 million adjustment recorded in 2014. this change in the lcm inventory valuation adjustment increased ebitda by 257%. results also improved by an additional 283% in 2015 due to an increase in refining margins. these improvements were offset in part by a 114% decline due to lower processing rates.
the increase in refining margins in 2015 relative to 2014 was generated by improved by-product price spreads to crude oil and increased purchases of crude oil at advantaged prices relative to the maya crude price benchmark. by-product spreads improved due to a decline in 2015 of the average per barrel price of crude oil relative to 2014. these factors more than offset the decline in the maya 2-1-1 benchmark margin in 2015 versus 2014.
crude processing rates in 2015 reflect an 8% decline relative to 2014. this decline is mainly due to a number of unplanned outages for maintenance that began in the latter part of the third quarter and extended into early december. the average crude processing rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 206 thousands of barrels per day. processing rates returned to near full capacity by mid-december 2015.
2014 versus 2013the $344 million lcm inventory valuation adjustment in 2014 represented a 189% decrease in ebitda during the period. ebitda was lower in 2014 relative to 2013 by an additional 7% due to a $14 million one-time recovery and settlement in 2013 discussed below. in addition to these items, our results reflected higher refining margins and higher volumes in 2014, which resulted in increases in ebitda of 98% and 34%, respectively.
higher refining margins in 2014 compared to 2013 were generated by improved average differentials between light and heavy crude oils, an increase in spreads between gasoline and diesel products versus light crude, improved by-product price spreads to crude oil cost and a decrease in the cost for rins.
refinery crude oil processing rates in 2014 were maintained near capacity with the exception of rates in the first quarter of 2014. processing rates in the first quarter of 2014 were negatively impacted by temporary reductions in coking capacity due to the repair of equipment necessitated by operational issues experienced in december 2013. planned repairs on a process vessel in april 2014 also resulted in reduced crude processing during that time.
technology segment overviewthe technology segment recognizes revenues related to the sale of polyolefin catalysts, licensing of chemical, polyolefin and other process technologies and associated engineering and other services. these revenues are offset in part by the costs incurred in the production of catalysts, licensing and services activities and in research and development (r&d) activities. in 2015, our technology segment incurred approximately 55% of all r&d costs while in the corresponding periods of 2014 and 2013, it incurred approximately 65% and 70%, respectively, of our r&d costs.
2015 versus 2014ebitda in 2015 was relatively unchanged compared to 2014, reflecting improved catalyst results and lower r&d expenses, offset by lower licensing and services revenues.
2014 versus 2013ebitda in 2014 was unchanged compared to 2013, reflecting lower r&d expenses and, to a lesser extent, higher catalyst results, offset by lower licensing and services revenues.
the following table sets forth selected financial information for the technology segment.

2015 versus 2014the unfavorable currency translation impacts due to the significantly weaker euro versus the u.s. dollar and a decline in licensing and services revenues contributed 12% and 7% to the decrease in 2015 revenues. these declines were offset in part by revenue increases of 12% and 1%, respectively, related to higher catalyst sales volumes and higher average catalyst sales prices in 2015.
2014 versus 2013lower licensing and services revenues contributed 7% to the decrease in revenues in 2014 compared to 2013, which benefited from the one-time, lump-sum settlement associated with a process license agreement entered into in a prior year. higher average catalyst sales prices increased revenues by 1% in 2014 while catalyst sales volumes reflected a corresponding decrease compared to the prior year period.
ebitdaebitda in 2015 increased by $11 million, or 5%, compared to 2014 and remained unchanged in 2014 compared to 2013.
2015 versus 2014ebitda increased by $11 million, or 5%, in 2015 compared to 2014 as improved catalyst volumes and margins were partly offset by unfavorable currency translation impacts, and lower r& d expenses were more than offset by lower licensing and services revenues.
2014 versus 2013ebitda in 2014 reflects lower r&d expenses and moderately higher catalyst results, offset by lower licensing and services revenues as discussed above. the improvement in 2014 catalyst results over 2013 was the result of higher margins due to higher average sales prices and lower cost.
financial condition operating, investing and financing activities of continuing operations, which are discussed below, are presented in the following table:
operating activities              $5,842                   $6,048                   $4,835
investing activities              (1,051   )               (3,531   )               (1,602   )
financing activities              (4,850   )               (5,907   )               (1,589   )
operating activitiescash of $5,842 million generated in 2015 primarily reflected earnings, adjusted for non-cash items, offset in part by cash used by the main components of working capitalaccounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable.
the main components of working capital consumed cash of $246 million in 2015. total cash used by the $786 million decrease in accounts payable and the $240 million increase in inventories was offset in part by a $780 million decline in accounts receivable. the decline in 2015 accounts payable reflects the lower cost of crude oil and other feedstocks. an increase in the levels of our u.s. olefins and crude oil inventories at year end led to the increase in 2015 inventories. u.s. olefins inventories increased in preparation for the turnaround at our corpus christi, texas facility in 2016 while the unplanned maintenance outage at our houston refinery resulted in the higher level of crude oil inventories at year end. accounts receivable decreased on lower average product sales prices, reflective of the drop in 2015 crude oil prices.
cash of $6,048 million generated in 2014 primarily reflected earnings, adjusted for non-cash items, distributions from our joint ventures and refunds totaling $232 million for value added taxes (vat) related to prior periods that were received from italian tax authorities in 2014. these cash inflows were offset in part by cash used by the main components of working capitalaccounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable.
the main components of working capital used cash of $225 million in 2014. total cash used by the $205 million increase in inventories and by the $378 million decrease in accounts payable was offset in part by a $358 million decline in accounts receivable. the increase in inventories primarily reflects higher olefins raw material inventories, which were offset in part by lower ethylene and propylene inventories due to turnaround activities at our la porte, texas facility, and higher levels of inventory for crude oil and work-in-process in our refining segment. accounts payable decreased due to lower feedstock costs in 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease in accounts receivable primarily reflects lower ethylene prices in our o&peai segment, lower oxyfuels prices in our i&d segment, lower average sales prices and year end volumes in north american polyolefins and lower prices for refining products. also contributing to the decline was a larger than usual accounts receivable balance at the end of 2013 attributable to customer remittance timing.
cash of $4,835 million generated in 2013 primarily reflected earnings, adjusted for non-cash items, proceeds received from italian tax authorities for refunds of vat from prior periods, distributions from our joint ventures, insurance settlements and cash provided by the main components of working capital. these increases were offset in part by company contributions to our pension plans.
the main components of working capital generated cash of $60 million in 2013. this reflected increases of $64 million, $151 million, and $275 million in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable, respectively. the increase in inventories was attributable to a build in our o&pamericas polyethylene inventory at the end of 2013 in preparation for a turnaround scheduled during the first half of 2014 at our la porte, texas facility and an increase in crude inventory levels over 2012 levels. these increases were partially offset by decreases in our i&d segment inventories. the increase in accounts receivable reflected higher year
end o&pamericas and i&d segment sales volumes in 2013 compared to 2012. a temporary increase in the purchase of intermediate feedstocks due to operating issues at the houston refinery at the end of 2013 and an increase in payment terms for crude oil purchases in our refining segment were the primary drivers for the increase in accounts payable.
investing activitieswe invested cash of $1,051 million, $3,531 million and $1,602 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
in 2014, we began to invest cash in investment-grade and other high-quality financial instruments that provide flexibility to redeploy funds as needed to meet our cash flow requirements while maximizing yield. in 2015 and 2014, we invested $2,073 million and $3,439 million, respectively, in securities, that are deemed available-for-sale and classified as short-term investments. we also invested $397 million and $425 million in tri-party repurchase agreements in 2015 and 2014, respectively. these investments are classified as short-term loans receivable except for a $101 million investment made during 2015 which is classified as a long-term loan receivable. we also received proceeds upon the sale and maturity of certain of our available-for-sale securities and repurchase agreement of $2,489 million and $350 million, respectively, in 2015 and $1,751 million and $75 million, respectively, in 2014. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these investments.
the following table summarizes our capital expenditures plan for 2016 and actual capital expenditures for our continuing operations for the periods from 2013 through 2015:
capital expenditures by segment:
technology                                                          46              24                    25                    30
consolidated capital expenditures of continuing operations      $1,833          $1,440                $1,499                $1,561
the amounts presented for the 2016 plan above include our contributions to our po joint venture assets.
capital spending projected for 2016 is expected to increase over 2015 levels. the largest projected increase is for our o&pamericas segment and includes spending for projects related to environmental, health and safety matters, the ethylene expansion and related turnaround of our corpus christi, texas facility, turnaround activities at one of our polyethylene facilities, the purchase of railcars and other projects. spending in 2016 is also projected to be higher for our refining and o&peai segments versus 2015. spending for the o&peai segment is expected to increase as a result of turnaround activities at two of our facilities. increased spending is planned for the refining segment in 2016 as certain capital maintenance and turnaround projects scheduled in 2015 were deferred until 2016 during the strike at our houston refinery. this increased level of spending is offset in part by lower projected spending in 2016 related to turnaround activities for our i&d segment as compared to 2015.
the decreased level of 2015 spending versus 2014 for our o&pamericas segment reflects the completion in 2014 of the ethylene expansion and associated turnaround at our la porte, texas facility, a debottleneck at our corpus christi, texas facility and the installation of new furnaces at our channelview, texas facility. turnaround activities at four of our u.s. and european facilities resulted in an increase in 2015 capital spending over 2014. the completion of the 2014 o&pamericas segment projects mentioned above are reflected in the
increase in 2014 capital spending relative to 2013. this increase was offset in part by reduced capital spending for our i&d, refining and o&peai segments in 2014 relative to 2013 due primarily to the completion in 2013 of the restart of our methanol plant in channelview, texas, a major turnaround at our houston, texas refinery, and a butadiene expansion project in wesseling, germany, respectively.
financing activitiesfinancing activities used cash of $4,850 million, $5,907 million and $1,589 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
we made payments totaling $4,656 million, $5,788 million and $1,949 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, to acquire a portion of our outstanding ordinary shares. we also made dividend payments totaling $1,410 million, $1,403 and $1,127 million to our shareholders in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. for additional information related to these share repurchases and dividend payments, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
in 2014, we entered into a commercial paper program. we received net proceeds of $61 million and $262 million through the issuance and repurchase of commercial paper instruments under this program during 2015 and 2014, respectively. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and the discussion of liquidity and capital resources below for additional information related to our commercial paper program.
in march 2015, we issued $1,000 million of 4.625% senior notes due 2055 and received net proceeds of $984 million. in february 2014, we issued $1,000 million of 4.875% guaranteed notes due 2044 and received net proceeds of $988 million. in july 2013, we received net proceeds totaling $1,468 million from the issuance of $750 million of 4% guaranteed notes due 2023 and $750 million of 5.25% guaranteed notes due 2043, and paid fees totaling $23 million. additional information related to these notes can be found in the liquidity and capital resources section below and in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these financing activities, see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
liquidity and capital resourcesas of december 31, 2015, we had $1,988 million unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities classified as short-term investments. for additional information related to our purchases of marketable securities, which currently include certificates of deposit, commercial paper, bonds and limited partnership investments, see the investing activities section above and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
at december 31, 2015, we held $456 million of cash in jurisdictions outside the u.s., principally in the united kingdom. less than 6% of our consolidated cash and cash equivalent balance is held in a country that has established government imposed currency restrictions that could impede the ability of our subsidiary to transfer funds to us. there are currently no other material or legal or economic restrictions that would impede our transfers of cash.
we also had total unused availability under our credit facilities of $2,862 million at december 31, 2015, which included the following:
                                                     $1,631 million under our $2,000 million revolving credit facility, which backs our $2,000 million commercial paper program. availability under this facility is net of outstanding borrowings, outstanding letters of credit provided under the facility and notes issued under our $2,000 million commercial paper program. a small portion of our availability under this facility is impacted by changes in the euro/u.s. dollar exchange rate. at december 31, 2015, we had $323 million of outstanding commercial paper, no outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings under the facility;
                       $748 million under our $900 million u.s. accounts receivable securitization facility. availability under this facility is subject to a borrowing base of eligible receivables, which is reduced by outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, if any. this facility had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit at december 31, 2015; and
                                430 million and $14 million (totaling approximately $483 million) under our 450 million european receivables securitization facility. availability under this facility is subject to a borrowing base, net of outstanding borrowings. there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility at december 31, 2015.
see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our credit facilities.
we have $624 million of outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees issued under uncommitted credit facilities at december 31, 2015. at december 31, 2015, we had total debt, including current maturities, of $8,028 million.
in accordance with our current interest rate risk management strategy and subject to managements evaluation of market conditions and the availability of favorable interest rates among other factors, we may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to economically convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to variable rate debt or convert a portion of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt.
in august 2015, we amended our u.s. accounts receivable securitization facility, which, among other things, decreased the purchase limit from $1 billion to $900 million, added a $300 million uncommitted accordion feature and extended the term of the facility to august 2018.
in june 2015, we entered into an agreement to extend the maturity of our senior revolving credit facility to june 2020. in september 2015, we entered into an agreement to reduce the letters of credit sublimit of our senior revolving credit facility from $700 million to $500 million.
in march 2015, we issued $1,000 million of 4.625% notes due 2055 at a discounted price of 98.353%. proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our ordinary shares. interest payments under these notes commenced on august 26, 2015. these unsecured notes rank equally in right of payment to all of lyondellbasell n.v.s existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness.
the notes may be redeemed before the date that is six months prior to the scheduled maturity date at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed and the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (discounted at the applicable treasury yield plus 35 basis points) on the notes to be redeemed. the notes may also be redeemed on or after the date that is six months prior to the final maturity date of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest.
in october 2014, we entered into a commercial paper program under which we may issue up to $2,000 million of privately placed, unsecured short-term promissory notes (commercial paper). this program is backed by our $2,000 million senior revolving credit facility. proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper may be used for general corporate purposes, including dividend payments and share repurchases. at december 31, 2015, we had $323 million of commercial paper outstanding.
in february 2014, our direct, 100% owned subsidiary, lyb international finance b.v., issued $1,000 million of 4.875% notes due 2044 at a discounted price of 98.831%. proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our ordinary shares. interest payments under these notes commenced on september 15, 2014. these unsecured notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by lyondellbasell industries n.v., rank equally in right of payment to all of lyb international finance b.v.s
existing and future unsecured indebtedness and to all of lyondellbasells existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness. the notes may be redeemed before the date that is six months prior to the scheduled maturity date at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed and the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (discounted at the applicable treasury yield plus 20 basis points) on the notes to be redeemed. the notes may also be redeemed on or after the date that is six months prior to the final maturity date of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest.
on july 16, 2013, lyb international finance b.v., issued $750 million of 4% guaranteed notes due 2023 and $750 million of 5.25% guaranteed notes due 2043 at discounted prices of 98.678% and 97.004%, respectively. proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our ordinary shares. interest payments under these notes commenced on january 15, 2014. these unsecured notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by lyondellbasell industries n.v., rank equally in right of payment to all of lyb international finance b.v.s existing and future unsecured indebtedness and to all of lyondellbasells existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness. these notes may be redeemed or repaid at any time and from time to time prior to maturity at an amount equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed and repaid, and the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis at the applicable treasury yield plus 25 basis points in the case of the 4% notes due 2023 and plus 30 basis points in the case of the 5.25% notes due 2043.
in april 2013, we amended and restated our 450 million european receivables securitization facility to obtain more favorable terms and conditions, including reduced pricing, and to extend the maturity date of the facility to april 2016.
for additional information related to our credit facilities and notes discussed above, see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
in may 2015, our shareholders approved a proposal to authorize us to repurchase up to an additional 10%, or approximately 47 million, of our shares outstanding over the next eighteen months. our share repurchase program does not have a stated dollar amount, and purchases may be made through open market purchases, private market transactions or other structured transactions. repurchased shares could be retired or used for general corporate purposes, including for various employee benefit and compensation plans. as of december 31, 2015, we have purchased 32 million shares under this program for approximately $2,896 million. as of february 11, 2016, we had approximately 7million shares remaining under the current authorization. the timing and amount of additional shares repurchased will be determined by our management board based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. for additional information related to our share repurchase programs, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
we may repay or redeem our debt, including purchases of our outstanding bonds in the open market, using cash on hand, cash from operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of debt, proceeds from asset divestitures, or a combination thereof. we plan to fund our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other funding requirements with cash from operations, which could be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. cash on hand, cash from operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of debt, or a combination thereof, may be used to fund the repurchase of shares under our share repurchase program.
we intend to continue to declare and pay quarterly dividends, with the goal of increasing the dividend over time, after giving consideration to our cash balances and expected results from operations.
we believe that our cash on hand, cash from operating activities and proceeds from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due.
contractual and other obligationsthe following table summarizes, as of december 31, 2015, our minimum payments for long-term debt, including current maturities, short-term debt, and contractual and other obligations for the next five years and thereafter:
advances from customers             97                57                    17                     7                     3                     2                        11
total debtour debt includes unsecured senior notes, guaranteed notes and various other u.s. and non-u.s. loans. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of covenant requirements under the credit facilities and indentures and additional information regarding our debt facilities.
interest on total debtour debt and related party debt agreements contain provisions for the payment of monthly, quarterly or semi-annual interest at a stated rate of interest over the term of the debt.
pension and other postretirement benefitswe maintain several defined benefit pension plans, as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. many of our u.s. and non-u.s. plans are subject to minimum funding requirements; however, the amounts of required future contributions for all our plans are not fixed and can vary significantly due to changes in economic assumptions, liability experience and investment return on plan assets. as a result, we have excluded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations from the contractual and other obligations table above. our annual contributions may include amounts in excess of minimum required funding levels. contributions to our non-u.s. plans in years beyond 2016 are not expected to be materially different than the expected 2016 contributions disclosed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. at december 31, 2015, the projected benefit obligation for our pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $871 million. subject to future actuarial gains and losses, as well as actual asset earnings, we, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, will be required to fund the $871 million, with interest, in future years. we contributed $107 million, $94 million and $172 million to our pension plans in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we provide other postretirement benefits, primarily medical benefits to eligible participants, as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. we pay other unfunded postretirement benefits as incurred.
advances from customerswe are obligated to deliver products in connection with long-term sales agreements under which advances from customers were received in prior years. these advances are treated as deferred revenue and will be amortized to earnings as product is delivered over the remaining terms of the respective contracts, which range predominantly from 4 to 8 years. the unamortized long-term portion of such advances totaled $40 million as of december 31, 2015.
otherother primarily consists of accruals for environmental remediation costs, obligations under deferred compensation arrangements, and anticipated asset retirement obligations. see critical accounting policies below for a discussion of obligations for environmental remediation costs.
deferred income taxesthe scheduled settlement of the deferred tax liabilities shown in the table is based on the scheduled reversal of the underlying temporary differences. actual cash tax payments will vary depending upon future taxable income. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our deferred tax liabilities.
purchase obligationswe are party to various obligations to purchase products and services, principally for raw materials, utilities and industrial gases. these commitments are designed to assure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements. the commitments are segregated into take-or-pay contracts and other contracts. under the take-or-pay contracts, we are obligated to make minimum payments whether or not we take the product or service. other contracts include contracts that specify minimum quantities; however, in the event that we do not take the contractual minimum, we are only obligated for any resulting economic loss suffered by the vendor. the payments shown for the other contracts assume that minimum quantities are purchased. for contracts with variable pricing terms, the minimum payments reflect the contract price at december 31, 2015.
operating leaseswe lease various facilities and equipment under noncancelable lease arrangements for various periods. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for related lease disclosures.
current business outlook the decline in crude oil prices has continued into the early part of 2016. in our o&pamericas and o&peai segments, ethylene prices have trended down with crude oil and in o&pamericas, with increased ethylene supplies due to high industry operating rates. as a result, the ethylene margin for o&pamericas is expected to be lower on an ngl feedstock basis, whereas o&peai should be able to hold and possibly grow the ethylene margin on a naphtha feedstock basis. polyolefins margins in the u.s. and europe are expected to remain healthy. in north america, polypropylene margins are being supported by a tight market and falling monomer prices could continue to support polyolefins margins in europe. during the first quarter, we will commence a turnaround at our berre, france cracker which is expected to impact first quarter results by $20 million in our o&peai segment.
thus far, our i&d segment has seen stable demand in the propylene oxide market; however, the restart of competitor plants impacted by outages may impact global product balances. strong gasoline prices and octane premiums partially offset the negative impacts of lower crude oil prices and seasonally higher butane prices on oxyfuels margins. additional capacity that has entered the market is putting downward pressure on our methanol margins.
although our refining segment expects to benefit from an improved maya 2-1-1 spread stemming from higher gasoline margins, planned maintenance on a crude unit and coker at our houston refinery, which is currently underway, is expected to have a $40 million negative impact on first quarter results. as a result of these maintenance activities, first quarter crude processing rates are expected to be similar to fourth quarter 2015 rates.
related party transactions we have related party transactions with a major shareholder and its affiliates and our joint venture partners. we believe that such transactions are effected on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would have been agreed upon by unrelated parties on an arms length basis. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional related party disclosures.
critical accounting policies management applies those accounting policies that it believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). our more critical accounting policies include those related to the valuation of inventory, long-lived assets, the valuation of goodwill, accruals for long-term employee benefit costs such as pension and other postretirement costs, and accruals for taxes based on income. inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management. management periodically updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment.
inventorywe account for our inventory using the last-in, first-out (lifo) method of accounting.
the cost of raw materials, which represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses, and energy costs generally follow price trends for crude oil and/or natural gas. crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to many factors, including changes in economic conditions. fluctuation in the prices of crude oil and natural gas from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods as market prices recover. accordingly, our cost of sales and results of operations may be affected by such fluctuations.
on may 1, 2010, upon emergence from bankruptcy, we recorded our inventory, which is primarily crude oil and correlated products derived therefrom, at fair value in accordance with the requirements of fresh-start accounting. the per barrel benchmark price of wti crude oil at that date was $86.15.
during 2014, we recorded lcm inventory valuation adjustments totaling $760 million driven primarily by the decline in the price of crude oil and related declines in the prices of heavy liquids and other correlated products. a $45 million charge was taken in the third quarter of 2014 which marked the beginning of the current downward price trend. an additional $715 million of lcm inventory valuation adjustment was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 to reflect decreases of approximately 50% in the price indices for crude oil and other correlated products as compared to the third quarter of 2014. since our inventory consists of manufactured products derived from crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and correlated materials, as well as the associated feedstocks and intermediate chemicals, our inventory market values are generally influenced by changes in benchmark crude oil and heavy liquid values and prices for manufactured finished goods. the degree of influence of a particular benchmark may vary from period to period, as the composition of the dollar value lifo pools change. due to natural inventory composition changes, variation in pricing from period to period does not necessarily result in a linear lcm impact. additionally, an lcm condition may arise due to a decline in a particular material that had previously provided a positive impact within a pool. as a result, market valuations and lcm conditions are dependent upon the composition and mix of materials on hand at the balance sheet date. in the measurement of an lcm adjustment, the numeric input value for determining the crude oil market price includes pricing that is weighted by volume of inventories held at a point in time, including wti, brent and maya crude oils. at december 31, 2014, representative prices for crude oil and heavy liquids were $47.59 per barrel and $45.20 per barrel, respectively. these price inputs were calculated using a weighted average of the materials held in inventory on that date.
the trend of falling hydrocarbon prices continued in 2015, leading to further lcm inventory valuation adjustments. in 2015, the cumulative charge related to lcm inventory valuation adjustments, which was driven by declines in crude oil, ethylene, propylene, benzene and etbe, was $548 million. representative prices used in the calculation of the cumulative lcm inventory adjustments recognized in 2015 were $30.22 per barrel for crude oil, 20 cents per pound for ethylene, 32 cents per pound for propylene, $2.14 per gallon for benzene and $1.66 per gallon for etbe. for additional information related to these lcm inventory adjustments, see note 22. further sustained price declines in our finished goods and raw materials could result in additional lcm inventory valuation charges during 2016.
currently all but one of our lifo inventory pools are at-risk for further adjustment as each impacted lifo pool is at, or approximates, the calculated market value at the last balance sheet measurement date. at-risk inventory accounts for $3.3 billion of our total inventory carrying value of $4.1 billion as of december 31, 2015. the extent to which further adjustment may occur is dependent on pool specific product prices and composition within each individual dollar value lifo pool at the balance sheet date.
long-lived assetswith respect to long-lived assets, which primarily include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, key assumptions included estimates of useful lives and the recoverability of carrying values of fixed assets and other intangible assets, as well as the existence of any obligations associated with the retirement of fixed assets. such estimates could be significantly modified and/or the carrying values of the assets could be impaired by such factors as new technological developments, new chemical industry entrants with significant raw material or other cost advantages, uncertainties associated with the european, u.s. and other world economies, the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries, and uncertainties associated with regulatory governmental actions.
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we evaluate definite lived intangible assets for impairment. long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets, which for us is generally at the plant group level (or, at times individual plants in certain circumstances where we have isolated production units with separately identifiable cash flows). when it is probable that the undiscounted cash flows of a tangible asset or asset group will not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. in-process research and development projects are impaired when abandoned.
the estimated useful lives of long-lived assets range from 3 to 30 years. depreciation and amortization of these assets, including amortization of capitalized plant turnaround costs, under the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives totaled $1,047 million in 2015. the useful lives of assets are assessed periodically and if determined to be shorter than originally estimated, depreciation and amortization charges would be accelerated over the revised useful life.
goodwillgoodwill of $536 million at december 31, 2015 represents the tax effect of the differences between the tax and book bases of our assets and liabilities resulting from the revaluation of those assets and liabilities to fair value in connection with the companys emergence from bankruptcy and adoption of fresh-start accounting. we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill of a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable.
we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. qualitative factors assessed for each of the reporting units include, but are not limited to, changes in long-term commodity prices, discount rates, competitive environments, planned capacity, cost factors such as raw material prices, and financial performance of the reporting units. if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a two-step quantitative test is required.
we also have the option to proceed directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test. under the two-step impairment test, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value, including goodwill. for step one of the impairment test, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a discounted cash-flow model. such a model inherently utilizes a significant number of estimates and assumptions, including operating margins, tax rates, discount rates, capital expenditures and working capital changes. step two of the impairment test would be performed should management conclude that the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, is in excess of its fair value. in step two of the impairment test, the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of its goodwill. valuation experts may be used in such an assessment. if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge equal to the excess would be recognized.
for 2015, management performed a qualitative impairment assessment of our reporting units which indicated that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value. accordingly, a quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test was not required. in 2014, management voluntarily performed a quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test for all reporting units. the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value. accordingly, no goodwill impairment was recognized in 2014.
long-term employee benefit costsour costs for long-term employee benefits, particularly pension and other postretirement medical and life insurance benefits, are incurred over long periods of time, and involve many uncertainties over those periods. the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties, and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. it is managements responsibility, often with the assistance of independent experts, to select assumptions that in its judgment represent its best estimates of the future effects of those uncertainties. it also is managements responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions.
the current benefit service costs, as well as the existing liabilities, for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis. the discount rate is a current rate, related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled. our assumed discount rate is based on yield information for high-quality corporate bonds with durations comparable to the expected cash settlement of our obligations. for the purpose of measuring the benefit obligations at december 31, 2015, we used a weighted average discount rate of 4.38% for the u.s. plans which reflects the different terms of the related benefit obligations. the weighted average discount rate used to measure obligations for non-u.s. plans at december 31, 2015 was 2.70%, reflecting market interest rates. the discount rates in effect at december 31, 2015 will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during 2016.
the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of other postretirement medical benefits are also measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. as of december 31, 2015, the assumed rate of increase for our u.s. plans was 7.3%, decreasing to 4.5% in 2038 and thereafter. a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate assumption would have had no significant effect on either the benefit liability or the net periodic cost, due to limits on our maximum contribution level under the medical plan.
the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption. investment returns that are recognized currently in net income represent the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets applied to a market-related value of plan assets which, for us, is defined as the market value of assets. the expected rate of return on plan assets is a longer term rate, and is expected to change less frequently than the current assumed discount rate, reflecting long-term market expectations, rather than current fluctuations in market conditions.
the weighted average expected long-term rate of return on assets in our u.s. plans of 8.00% is based on the average level of earnings that our independent pension investment advisor had advised could be expected to be earned over time and 3.63%, for our non-u.s. plan assets is based on an expectation and asset allocation that varies by region. the asset allocations are summarized in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. the actual returns in 2015 were a loss of 0.83% for u.s. plan assets and a gain of 1.26% for non-u.s. plan assets.
the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets. managements goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility.
net periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the expected asset earnings, rather than the actual earnings or loss. along with other gains and losses, this unrecognized amount, to the extent it cumulatively exceeds 10% of the projected benefit obligation for the respective plan, is recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service period of the participants in each plan.
the following table reflects the sensitivity of the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans to changes in the actuarial assumptions:

projected benefit obligations at december 31, 2015   $285                    $56           $                  $

accruals for taxes based on incomethe determination of our provision for income taxes and the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities is subject to managements estimates and judgments due to the complexity of the tax laws and regulations in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of these complex laws and regulations.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse.
we recognize future tax benefits to the extent that the realization of these benefits is more likely than not. our current provision for income taxes is impacted by the recognition and release of valuation allowances related to net deferred assets in certain non-u.s. jurisdictions. further changes to these valuation allowances may impact our future provision for income taxes, which will include no tax benefit with respect to losses incurred and no tax expense with respect to income generated in these countries until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated.
we recognize the financial statement benefits with respect to an uncertain income tax position that we have taken or may take on an income tax return when we believe it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities. for a position that is likely to be sustained, the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest cumulative amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized.

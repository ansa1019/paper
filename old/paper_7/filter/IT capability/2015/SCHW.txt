the charles schwab corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
overview management of the company focuses on several key client activity and financial metrics in evaluating the company's financial position and operating performance. management believes that net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin, earnings per common share (eps), and return on average common stockholders' equity provide broad indicators of the company's overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. expenses excluding interest as a percentage of average client assets are considered by management to be a measure of operating efficiency. results for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 are:

the company's financial results are highly correlated to the general overall strength of economic conditions and, more specifically, to the direction of the u.s. equity and fixed income markets, the mortgage lending markets and residential credit trends. overall market conditions, interest rates, economic, political and regulatory trends, and industry competition are among the factors that could affect results and which are unpredictable.
interest rates have a direct correlation to the company's ability to generate net interest revenue, as interest-earning assets and funding sources are sensitive to changes in the rate environment. to the extent short-term interest rates remain at current low levels, the company's net interest revenue will continue to be constrained, even as growth in average balances helps to
the charles schwab corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
increase such revenue. net interest revenue is also impacted by the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing funding sources, as well as the company's ability to attract assets from new and existing clients.
the interest rate environment also affects asset management and administration fees through the fees earned on the company's lineup of proprietary money market funds. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, the low interest rate environment caused the company to waive a portion of its money fund fees. to the extent that short-term rates remain low, asset management and administration fees may continue to be negatively affected. other drivers of asset management and administration fees include securities valuations and the company's ability to attract assets from new and existing clients.
the company generates trading revenue through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenue primarily from trading activity in client fixed income securities. trading revenue is impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of prices in the equity and fixed income markets, and commission rates. volatility in the markets can influence client behavior in terms of investment decisions and volume of trading activity.
in 2015, the company's revenue and net income grew despite an environment that included significant equity market volatility and continued low interest rates. the standard & poor's 500 index declined as much as 9% during the year and ultimately ended the year down 1% when compared to the prior year. the federal funds short-term target rate increased 25 basis points in december 2015, however, the increase had limited effect on 2015 results. the average 3-month london interbank offered rate (libor) yield improved 8 basis points to .32% compared to 2014. long-term interest rates decreased in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. the average 10-year u.s. treasury yield during 2015 was 2.13%, 40 basis points lower than the average yield during 2014.
strong client momentum continued as the company's innovative, full-service model continued to resonate with clients and drive growth during the year. core net new assets totaled $134.7 billion in 2015 compared to $124.8 billion in 2014. total client assets ended 2015 at $2.51 trillion, up 2% from the year ended 2014, despite the $89.2 billion impact of reduced market valuation on client assets during the year.
the company added 1.1 million new brokerage accounts to its client base during 2015, up 10% compared to 2014. active brokerage accounts ended 2015 at 9.8 million, up 4% on a year-over-year basis. faced with economic uncertainty and the resulting market volatility, investors increasingly turned to advice offerings throughout the year. over 155,000 accounts enrolled in one of the company's retail advisory solutions during 2015, 60% more than the year-earlier period, and total accounts using these solutions reached 560,000, up 14% year-over-year.
during 2015, the company's net revenues increased 5% compared to 2014 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees, partially offset by a decrease in trading revenue.
·   net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher client cash balances generating increased interest-earning assets, partially offset by lower average interest rate margins.
·   asset management and administration fees increased due to higher client asset balances and higher net yields earned on money market funds.
·   trading revenue decreased for 2015 primarily due to lower commissions per revenue trade and lower daily average revenue trades.
growth in expenses, excluding interest, was limited to a 4% increase in 2015 primarily reflecting business growth related increases in compensation, benefits and other expenses.
the combined effect of market conditions, strong business growth, and the company's overall spending discipline resulted in a pre-tax profit margin of 35.7% in 2015.
the company operated in an environment of mixed market conditions during 2014 compared to 2013, as the nasdaq composite index, standard & poor's 500 index, and dow jones industrial average showed periods of volatility before
the charles schwab corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
ending the year up 13%, 11%, and 8%, respectively. the federal funds target rate remained unchanged at a range of zero to .25% during 2014. the average 10-year u.s. treasury yield increased by 20 basis points to 2.53% during 2014 compared to 2013, while the yield ended the year down 86 basis points to 2.17%. in the same period, the average three-month u.s. treasury bill yield decreased by 3 basis points to .02%.
the company's steady focus on serving investor needs through its full-service investing model continued to drive growth during 2014. total client assets ended the year at $2.46 trillion, up 10% from 2013, reflecting net new client assets of $124.8 billion and a rising equity market environment. in addition, the company added almost 1 million new brokerage accounts to its client base during 2014. active brokerage accounts reached 9.4 million in 2014, up 3% from 2013.
as a result of the company's strong key client activity metrics, the company achieved a pre-tax profit margin of 34.9% in 2014. overall, net income increased by 23% in 2014 from 2013 and the return on average common stockholders' equity was 12% in 2014.
overall, net revenues increased by 11% in 2014 from 2013, primarily due to increases in net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, and other revenue.
·   net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets, including margin loans and the company's investment portfolio (securities available for sale and securities held to maturity), and the effect higher average interest rates on securities held to maturity had on the company's average net interest margin.
·   asset management and administration fees increased due to fees from mutual fund services, advice solutions, and other asset management and administration services.
·   other revenue increased primarily due to a net insurance settlement of $45 million, net litigation proceeds of $28 million related to the company's non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (rmbs) portfolio, and increases in order flow revenue.
expenses excluding interest increased by 6% in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense as a result of a charge of $68 million for estimated future severance benefits resulting from changes in the company's geographic footprint and an increase in professional services expense.
current regulatory environment and other developments in december 2015, the occ issued proposed guidelines to establish standards for recovery planning by national banks and federal savings banks with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. the proposed guidelines would require each bank to develop and maintain a recovery plan that sets forth the bank's plan for how it will remain a going concern when it is experiencing considerable financial or operational stress. the comment period for the proposed guidelines ended on february 16, 2016 and the guidelines are subject to further modification. the company is currently evaluating the impact of the proposed guidelines.
in october 2015, the federal reserve issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would require certain financial institutions that are subject to the federal reserve's capital rules to apply a regulatory capital deduction treatment to their investments in unsecured debt issued by u.s. bank holding companies identified as global systemically important banking organizations. the comment period for the rule proposal ended on february 19, 2016 and the rule proposal is subject to further modification. the company is currently evaluating the impact of the proposed rule.
in october 2015, the fdic issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would impose a surcharge on the quarterly assessments of insured depository institutions with total assets of $10 billion or more. the surcharge would equal an annual rate of 4.5 basis points applied to the institution's assessment base, with certain adjustments. the fdic expects the proposed surcharge to commence in the third quarter of 2016 and continue through the quarter that the reserve ratio of the dif reaches 1.35%. under the proposed rule, if by year-end 2018, the reserve ratio has not reached 1.35%, the fdic would impose a shortfall assessment on the institutions subject to the surcharge. the comment period for the rule proposal ended on january 5, 2016 and the rule proposal is subject to further modification. the company will continue to evaluate the impact of the proposed rule.

in april 2015, the department of labor published notice of a rule proposal to significantly broaden the definition of "fiduciary" under the employee retirement income security act of 1974. if adopted, among other things, the new rule would subject broker-dealers who provide non-discretionary investment advice to retirement plans and accounts to a "best interest" standard, as well as other conditions and requirements. the second comment period for the rule proposal ended on september 24, 2015 and the rule proposal is subject to further modification. the company will continue to evaluate the impact of the proposed rule.         results of operations net revenues year ended december 31,                                    2015                                2014                                2013

net interest revenue net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. the company's interest-earning assets are primarily funded through bank deposits and brokerage client account balances.
interest-earning assets include cash and cash equivalents, segregated cash and investments, margin loans included in receivables from brokerage clients, investment securities and bank loans. revenue on interest-earning assets is affected by various factors such as distribution and composition of assets, prevailing interest rates when purchased, and changes in prepayment levels. fees earned on securities borrowed and loaned are included in other interest revenue and expense. the rates on the majority of the company's investment securities and loans re-price or reset based on short-term market rates and the remainder is invested in fixed-rate loans and securities.
the company's interest-bearing liabilities include bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients and long-term debt. interest-bearing liabilities are primarily sensitive to short-term interest rates and the company establishes the rates paid on most of these liabilities. the company expects that the rate paid on these liabilities will generally adjust at some fraction of the movement in short-term market rates.
the company expects that net interest revenue will increase as short-term market rates increase and decline should rates fall below current levels. when interest rates fall, the company may attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by lowering rates paid to clients on interest-bearing liabilities. the current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the company can reduce interest expense on funding sources. the company may also alter the amount and type of fixed rate loans and securities that are added to the portfolio. generally, increases in the percentage of fixed-rate assets relative to non-interest-bearing liabilities will reduce the rate at which net interest revenue changes if rates move.
non-interest bearing funding sources include non-interest bearing cash balances, stockholders' equity and other miscellaneous assets and liabilities.

net interest revenue increased $253 million or 11% in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect of lower net interest margins. the growth in the average balances in bank deposits resulted from an increase in the uninvested cash balances in certain brokerage client accounts swept to schwab bank.
net interest revenue increased $292 million or 15% in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, including margin loans and the company's investment portfolio, and the effect higher average interest rates on securities held to maturity had on the company's average net interest margin. the growth in the average balance of bank deposits funded the increase in the balances of securities held to maturity and securities available for sale.
trading revenue trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. commission revenue is affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from trading activity in client fixed income securities. factors that influence principal transaction revenue include the volume of client trades and market price volatility. to accommodate clients' fixed income trading activity, the company maintains positions in fixed income securities, including u.s. state and municipal debt obligations, u.s. government, corporate debt, and other securities. the difference between the price at which the company buys and sells securities to and from its clients and other broker-dealers is recognized as principal transaction revenue. principal transaction revenue also includes adjustments to the fair value of these securities positions.

(1)   during 2015, the corporate brokerage retirement services business was transferred from the investor services segment to the advisor services segment. all prior-period amounts have been recast to conform with the current year presentation.
investor services net revenues increased by $174 million, or 4%, in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, and other revenue, partially offset by a decrease in trading revenue. net interest revenue increased mainly due to higher balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect of lower net interest margins. asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to fees from advice solutions which increased mainly due to growth in client assets enrolled in advisory offers. other revenue increased primarily due to litigation proceeds relating to the company's non-agency rmbs portfolio. trading revenue decreased in 2015 from 2014 largely due to lower commissions per revenue trade and lower daily average revenue trades. expenses excluding interest increased by $153 million, or 5%, in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to growth in the business resulting in increases in compensation and benefits and other expenses.

risk management the company's business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, credit, market, liquidity, compliance and legal risk. the company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. despite the company's efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks.
the company's risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting and risk mitigation. the activities and organizations that comprise the risk management process are described below.
the charles schwab corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
risk culture the board of directors has approved an enterprise risk management (erm) framework that incorporates the company's purpose, vision and values to form the bedrock of its risk culture and set the tone for the organization.
the erm framework and governance structure constitute a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered by the company in its business activities. the framework incorporates key concepts commensurate with the size, risk profile, complexity, and continuing growth of the company. risk appetite, which is defined as the amount of risk the company is willing to accept in pursuit of its corporate strategy, is set by executive management and approved by the board of directors.
risk governance senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring and controlling risks.
the global risk committee, which is comprised of senior executives from each major business and control function, is responsible for the oversight of risk management. this includes identifying emerging risks, assessing risk management practices and the control environment, reinforcing business accountability for risk management, supervisory controls and regulatory compliance, supporting resource prioritization across the company, and escalating significant issues to the board of directors.
the company has established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite. the risk metrics, with risk limits and tolerance levels, are established for key risk categories by the global risk committee and its functional risk sub-committees.
the global risk committee reports regularly to the risk committee of the board of directors. the risk committee in turn assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the company's risk management program, including approving risk appetite statements and reviewing reports relating to risk issues from functional areas of risk management, legal, compliance, and internal audit.
functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report to the global risk committee. these sub-committees include the:
·   asset-liability management and pricing committee, which establishes strategies and policies for the management of corporate capital, liquidity, interest rate risk, and investments;
·   compliance risk committee, which provides oversight of compliance risk management programs and policies providing an aggregate view of compliance risk exposure;
·   credit and market risk oversight committee, which provides oversight of and approves credit and market risk policies, limits, and exposures in loan, investment, and positioning portfolios;
·   new products and services risk oversight committee, which provides oversight of, and approves corporate policy and procedures relating to the risk governance of new products and services; and the
·   operational risk oversight committee, which provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies, risk tolerance levels, and operational risk governance processes, and includes the following sub-committees:
o   client fiduciary risk sub-committee, which provides oversight of fiduciary risk throughout the company;
o   global data subcommittee, which oversees and approves corporate policies and standards related to enterprise data governance;
o   information security and privacy sub-committee, which provides oversight of the information and cyber security and privacy programs and policies;
o   model governance sub-committee, which provides oversight of model risk throughout the company; and the
o   vendor management sub-committee, which provides oversight of the company's vendor management and outsourcing program and policies.
the charles schwab corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
senior management has also created an incentive compensation risk oversight committee, which establishes policy and reviews and approves the annual risk assessment of incentive compensation plans, and reports directly to the board compensation committee.
the company's compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring the company's risk management.
in addition, the company's disclosure committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the company's (a) disclosure controls and procedures and (b) internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. the disclosure committee reports on this evaluation to the ceo and cfo prior to their certification required by sections 302 and 906 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002.
operational risk operational risks arise due to potentially inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events and relationships impacting the company and/or any of its key business partners and vendors. operational risk includes fiduciary, information security, legal, and model risk, and each is also described in detail below.
the company's operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and the company's success depends, in part, on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs. to the extent the company experiences system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to its systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), the company's business and operations could be significantly negatively impacted. to minimize business interruptions, schwab has two data centers intended, in part, to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency. the company is committed to an ongoing process of upgrading, enhancing, and testing its technology systems. this effort is focused on meeting client needs, meeting market and regulatory changes, and deploying standardized technology platforms.
operational risk also includes the risk of human error, employee misconduct, external fraud, computer viruses, cyber attacks, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters. employee misconduct could include fraud and misappropriation of client or company assets, improper use or disclosure of confidential client or company information, and unauthorized activities, such as transactions exceeding acceptable risks or authorized limits. external fraud includes misappropriation of client or company assets by third parties, including through unauthorized access to company systems and data and client accounts. the frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase.
operational risk is mitigated through a system of internal controls and risk management practices that are designed to keep operational risk and operational losses at levels appropriate to the inherent risk of the business in which the company operates. the company has specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and uses periodic risk self-assessments and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. the company maintains backup and recovery functions, including facilities for backup and communications, and conducts periodic testing of disaster recovery plans. the company also maintains policies and procedures and technology to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to systems and data.
despite the company's risk management efforts, it is not always possible to deter or prevent technological or operational failure, or fraud or other misconduct, and the precautions taken by the company may not be effective in all cases. the company may be subject to litigation, losses, and regulatory actions in such cases, and may be required to expend significant additional resources to remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures.
the company also faces operational risk when it employs the services of various external vendors, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. the company manages its exposure to external vendor risk through contractual provisions, control standards, and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance. the company maintains policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with company data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. the company
the charles schwab corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
clearly defines for employees, contractors, and vendors the company's expected standards of care for confidential data. regular training is provided by the company in regard to data security.
the company is actively engaged in the research and development of new technologies, services, and products. the company endeavors to protect its research and development efforts, and its brands, through the use of copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and contracts.
fiduciary risk fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. the company attempts to manage this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business. guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees.     information security risk information security risk is the potential for unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, perusal, inspection, recording or destruction of the firm's information or systems. the company has designed and implemented a security program that knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data. the company continuously monitors the systems and works collaboratively with government agencies, law enforcement and other financial institutions to address potential threats. the company uses advanced monitoring systems to identify suspicious activity and deter unauthorized access by internal or external actors. the company limits the number of employees who have access to clients' personal information and enforces internal authentication measures to protect against the potential for social engineering. all employees who handle sensitive information are trained in privacy and security. schwab's fraud and cyber security teams monitor activity looking for suspicious behavior. these capabilities allow the company to identify and quickly act on any attempted intrusions.     legal risk legal risk is the risk of a claim for damages or other relief brought by clients, employees or third parties, alleging a breach of legal requirements or other duties under law. this risk may occur as a result of operational failure but may also occur as a result of other factors. the financial services industry is subject to substantial litigation risk, and the firm incurs legal claims in the ordinary course of business. increased litigation costs or substantial legal liability relating to an extraordinary claim or incidence of claims could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and financial condition. for information about the company's legal risk, see "item 1a - risk factors," and "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - 15. commitments and contingencies."     model risk model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. models are owned by several business units throughout the company, and are used for a variety of purposes. model use includes, but is not limited to, calculating capital requirements for hypothetical stressful environments, estimating interest and credit risk for loans and other balance sheet assets, and providing guidance in the management of client portfolios. the company has established a policy to describe the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders in model development, management, and use. all models at the company are registered in a centralized database and classified into different risk ratings depending on their potential financial, reputational, or regulatory impact to the company. the model risk rating informs the scope of all model governance activities.
the charles schwab corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
compliance risk the company faces significant compliance risk in its business, that is, the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. among other things, compliance risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for company products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of the company's controls. the company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, including sros. such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex, and regulatory proceedings and sanctions against financial services firms continue to increase.
the company attempts to manage compliance risk through policies, procedures and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. these procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, and employment policies. despite the company's efforts to maintain an effective compliance program and internal controls, legal breaches and rule violations could result in reputational harm, significant losses and disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the company's business activities.
credit risk credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations. the nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction, the structure and duration of that transaction, and the parties involved.
the company's exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending and client option and futures activities, securities lending activities, mortgage lending activities, pledged asset lending, its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and other investing activities. to manage the risks of such losses, the company has established policies and procedures which include: establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin, pal, option, and futures requirements for certain securities. collateral arrangements relating to margin loans, pals, option positions, securities lending agreements, and resale agreements include provisions that require additional collateral in the event market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral received. additionally, for margin loan, pal and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral exceeds the amounts loaned.
schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if schwab's client or a counterparty fails to meet its obligations to schwab.
the company's bank loan portfolio includes first mortgages, helocs, pals and other loans. the credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual and portfolio reviews performed by management. management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. all are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for loan losses.
the company's residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum loan-to-value (ltv) ratios, cash out limits, and minimum fair isaac corporation (fico) credit scores. the specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo).
the company does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a fico score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. at december 31, 2015, approximately 1% of both the first mortgage and heloc portfolios consisted of loans to borrowers with updated borrower fico (updated fico) scores of less than 620.
the charles schwab corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
at december 31, 2015, the weighted-average originated ltv ratio was 58% and 59% for the first mortgage and heloc portfolios, respectively. the computation of the ltv ratios at origination (origination ltv) for a heloc includes any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of origination. at december 31, 2015, 21% of helocs ($583 million of the heloc portfolio) were in a first lien position. the weighted-average originated fico score was 771 and 769 for the first mortgage and heloc portfolios, respectively.
the company monitors the estimated current ltv ratios (estimated current ltv) of its first mortgage and heloc portfolios on an ongoing basis. at december 31, 2015, the weighted-average estimated current ltv ratios were 48% and 51% for the first mortgage and heloc portfolios, respectively. the computation of the estimated current ltv ratio for a heloc includes any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of the heloc's origination. the company estimates the current ltv ratio for each loan by reference to a home price appreciation index. the company also monitors updated borrower fico scores, delinquency trends, and verified liquid assets held by individual borrowers. at december 31, 2015, the weighted-average updated fico scores were 773 and 770 for the first mortgage and heloc portfolios, respectively.
a portion of the company's heloc portfolio is secured by second liens on the associated properties. second lien mortgage loans possess a higher degree of credit risk given the subordination to the first lien holder in the event of default. at december 31, 2015, $2.2 billion, or 79%, of the heloc portfolio was in a second lien position. in addition to the credit monitoring activities described above, the company also monitors credit risk on second lien heloc loans by reviewing the delinquency status of the first lien loan on the associated property. at december 31, 2015, approximately 28% of the heloc borrowers that had a balance only paid the minimum amount of interest due or less.
for more information on the company's credit quality indicators relating to its first mortgage and heloc portfolios, including delinquency characteristics, borrower fico scores at origination, updated borrower fico scores, ltv ratios at origination, and estimated current ltv ratios, see "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - 6. bank loans and related allowance for loan losses."
the following table presents certain of the company's bank loan quality metrics as a percentage of total outstanding loans:
allowance for loan losses      0.22   %      0.31   %
the company has exposure to credit risk associated with its available for sale and held to maturity securities which include u.s. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, u.s. agency notes, u.s. treasury securities, certificates of deposit, and u.s. state and municipal securities.
at december 31, 2015, substantially all securities in the available for sale and held to maturity portfolios were rated investment grade (defined as a rating equivalent to a moody's rating of "baa" or higher, or a standard & poor's rating of "bbb-" or higher). u.s. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the u.s. government-sponsored enterprises.
concentration risk the company has exposure to concentration risk when holding large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or within a particular industry or geographical area.
the charles schwab corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
the fair value of the company's investments in mortgage-backed securities totaled $72.3 billion at december 31, 2015. of these, $71.0 billion were issued by u.s. agencies and $1.3 billion were issued by private entities (non-agency securities). these u.s. agency and non-agency securities are included in securities available for sale and securities held to maturity.
the fair value of the company's investments in asset-backed securities totaled $21.5 billion at december 31, 2015. schwab holds $11.4 billion floating rate federal family education loan program asset-backed securities (ffelp abs). two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations have placed a portion of ffelp abs on review for downgrade. both agencies have indicated that some classes could be downgraded below investment grade due to the risk that some remainder of the securities could be outstanding after their legal final maturity date. the timing of ffelp abs principal payments is inherently uncertain given the variety of payment options available to student loan borrowers. loans collateralizing these securities continue to offer a guarantee from the department of education of at least 97%. schwab holds only senior class notes that have additional credit enhancement of 3% or more that, together with the department of education guarantee, provide 100% or more credit enhancement. the company has an independent credit assessment function and it does not rely on rating agencies. the company does not consider these securities to be impaired because it expects full payment of principal and interest. therefore, the company continues to assign them the highest internal credit rating.
the fair value of the company's investments in corporate debt securities and commercial paper totaled $11.1 billion at december 31, 2015, with the majority issued by institutions in the financial services industry. these securities are included in securities available for sale, cash and cash equivalents, and other securities owned in the company's consolidated balance sheets. issuer, geographic, and sector concentrations are controlled by established credit policy limits to each concentration type.
the company's bank loans include $7.5 billion of adjustable rate first mortgage loans at december 31, 2015. the company's adjustable rate mortgages have initial fixed interest rates for three to ten years and interest rates that adjust annually thereafter. approximately 39% of these mortgages consisted of loans with interest-only payment terms. the interest rates on approximately 53% of these interest-only loans are not scheduled to reset for three or more years. the company's mortgage loans do not include interest terms described as temporary introductory rates below current market rates.
the company's heloc product has a 30-year loan term with an initial draw period of ten years from the date of origination. after the initial draw period, the balance outstanding at such time is converted to a 20-year amortizing loan. the interest rate during the initial draw period and the 20-year amortizing period is a floating rate based on the prime rate plus a margin. helocs that convert to an amortizing loan may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than those in the initial draw period. the company's allowance for loan loss methodology takes this increased inherent risk into consideration. the following table presents when current outstanding helocs will convert to amortizing loans:
within 1 year                                      166
the company also has exposure to concentration risk from its margin and securities lending, pal, and client option and futures activities collateralized by or referencing securities of a single issuer, an index, or within a single industry. this concentration risk is mitigated by collateral arrangements that require the fair value of such collateral exceeds the amounts loaned.
the company has indirect exposure to u.s. government and agency securities held as collateral to secure its resale agreements. the company's primary credit exposure on these resale transactions is with its counterparty. the company would have exposure to the u.s. government and agency securities only in the event of the counterparty's default on the resale agreements. the fair value of u.s. government and agency securities held as collateral for resale agreements totaled $8.2 billion at december 31, 2015.
the charles schwab corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
foreign holdings the company has exposure to non-sovereign financial and non-financial institutions in foreign countries. the majority of the company's foreign investments, at fair value, of $1.5 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion are in canada, australia and france, respectively, at december 31, 2015. these exposures are based on which country the issuer or counterparty is domiciled. the company has no direct exposure to sovereign foreign governments. the company does not have unfunded commitments to counterparties in foreign countries, nor does it have exposure as a result of credit default protection purchased or sold separately as of december 31, 2015.
in addition to direct holdings in foreign companies, the company also has indirect exposure to foreign countries through its investments in schwab sponsored money market funds (collectively, the funds) resulting from clearing activities. at december 31, 2015, the company had $261 million in investments in these funds. certain of the funds' positions include certificates of deposits, time deposits, commercial paper and corporate debt securities issued by counterparties in foreign countries.
market risk market risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by the company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices or market conditions. included in market risk is interest rate risk, which is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movement of interest rates. for discussion of the company's market risk, see "item 7a - quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."     liquidity risk liquidity risk arises from the inability to meet obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses. it is the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument. limits and contingency funding scenarios have been established for the company to support liquidity levels and quality during both expected and stressed scenarios. the company seeks to maintain client confidence in its balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the company to meet its obligations under both expected and stressed scenarios. see "liquidity" for additional detail on the company's liquidity requirements.         liquidity csc's liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of schwab bank and schwab, the amount of dividend payments on csc's common and preferred stock and principal and interest due on corporate debt. the liquidity needs of its brokerage subsidiaries are primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin borrowing activities and capital expenditures; and the liquidity needs of its bank subsidiary are primarily driven by lending and investment activities and client withdrawals of deposits.
the company has established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of its business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet its operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stress conditions.
the company employs a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity. the company conducts regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure the company's ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. liquidity is also tested at key subsidiaries and results are reported on a monthly basis to the company's corporate asset-liability management and pricing committee. a number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the company and are reviewed with management as appropriate.
the charles schwab corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
as of january 1, 2016, the company is required to comply with the modified lcr rule. this rule was adopted to help regulators ensure that large financial institutions have sufficient liquidity to withstand a short-term stress scenario, and is measured by comparing available high quality liquid assets against prescriptive cash outflows over a 30 day horizon. the company is currently in compliance with the fully phased-in modified lcr rule.     primary funding sources the company's primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity: bank deposits and cash balances in brokerage client accounts. in 2015 bank deposits swept from brokerage accounts increased $26.0 billion. these funds were used to invest in interest earning assets, thereby funding a significant portion of the 19% growth in the company's balance sheet.
other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending, and cash provided by external financing or equity offerings.
to meet daily funding needs, the company maintains liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. for unanticipated liquidity needs, the company maintains high-quality liquid assets, currently comprised of u.s. treasury notes.
additional funding sources in addition to internal sources of liquidity, the company has sources of external funding. csc maintains a $750 million committed, unsecured credit facility with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in june 2016. other than an overnight borrowing to test the availability of this facility, it was unused during 2015. the funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes. the financial covenants require schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, schwab bank to be well capitalized, and csc to maintain a minimum level of stockholders' equity, adjusted to exclude aoci. at december 31, 2015, the minimum level of stockholders' equity required under this facility was $8.9 billion (csc's stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, at december 31, 2015 was $13.5 billion). management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on csc's ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements.
csc and schwab also have access to uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with several banks. the need for short-term borrowings arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-earning investments, and movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements. schwab used such borrowings for six days in 2015, with average daily amounts borrowed of $137 million. these lines were not used by csc during 2015. there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at december 31, 2015.
to partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the options clearing corporation, the broker-dealer subsidiaries have unsecured standby letter of credit agreements (locs) with several banks in favor of the options clearing corporation aggregating $295 million at december 31, 2015. there were no funds drawn under any of these locs during 2015 or 2014. in connection with its securities lending activities, the company is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. the collateral requirements were satisfied by providing cash as collateral.
schwab bank has access to short-term secured funding through the federal reserve's discount window. amounts available under the federal reserve discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain of schwab bank's securities available for sale and/or securities held to maturity that are pledged as collateral. schwab bank maintains policies and procedures necessary to access this funding and tests discount window borrowing procedures on a periodic basis. at december 31, 2015, $2.0 billion was available under this arrangement. there were no funds drawn under this arrangement during 2015, except for testing purposes.        schwab bank also maintains a secured credit facility with the federal home loan bank of san francisco. amounts available under this facility are dependent on the amount of schwab bank's residential real estate mortgages and helocs that are pledged as collateral. schwab bank maintains policies and procedures necessary to access this funding and tests borrowing

procedures on a periodic basis. at december 31, 2015, $9.3 billion was available under this facility. there were no funds drawn under this facility during 2015, except for testing purposes.        csc has authorization from its board of directors to issue unsecured commercial paper notes (commercial paper notes) not to exceed $1.5 billion. management has set a current limit for the commercial paper program not to exceed the amount of the committed, unsecured credit facility, which was $750 million at december 31, 2015. the maturities of the commercial paper notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. the commercial paper is not redeemable prior to maturity and cannot be voluntarily prepaid. the proceeds of the commercial paper program are to be used for general corporate purposes. csc's ratings for these short-term borrowings are p1 by moody's, a1 by standard & poor's, and f1 by fitch. there were   no borrowings of commercial paper notes outstanding at december 31, 2015 or 2014.
at december 31, 2015 and 2014, csc had long-term debt of $2.9 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, which bears interest at a weighted-average rate of 3.38%. csc has a universal automatic shelf registration statement (shelf registration statement) on file with the sec which enables it to issue debt, equity, and other securities.
on march 10, 2015, csc issued $625 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that mature in 2018 and $375 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that mature in 2025. the senior notes due 2018 and 2025 have a fixed interest rate of 1.50% and 3.00%, respectively, with interest payable semi-annually. additionally, on november 13, 2015, csc issued $350 million aggregate amount of 3.450% senior notes that mature in 2026, with interest payable semi-annually.

capital management the company seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of its business strategy, including anticipated balance sheet growth, providing financial support to its subsidiaries, and sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting its regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to schwab bank. the company's primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of its subsidiaries and securities issuances by csc in the capital markets. to ensure that it has a sufficient amount of capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, the company has adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios. the level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives, and legislative and regulatory developments.
internal guidelines are set, for both the company and its regulated subsidiaries, to ensure capital levels are in line with the company's strategy and regulatory requirements, and capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at capital planning and asset-liability management and pricing committee meetings. a number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential problems that could impact capital and are reviewed with management as appropriate. in addition, the company monitors its subsidiaries' capital levels and requirements. subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals, any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to csc in the form of dividends and returns. when subsidiaries have need of additional capital, funds are provided by csc as equity investments and also as subordinated loans (in a form approved as regulatory capital by regulators) for schwab. the details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity's needs and financing alternatives. the amounts and structure of infusions must take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements, debt/equity ratios, and equity double leverage ratios.
the company conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various plausible adverse macroeconomic and company-specific events to which csc and its subsidiaries could be subjected. the objective of the company's capital stress testing is (1) to explore various potential outcomes - including rare and extreme events and (2) to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity. additionally, the company has a comprehensive capital contingency plan to provide action plans for certain low probability/high impact capital events that the company might face. the capital contingency plan is issued under the authority of the asset-liability management and pricing
the charles schwab corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events. it does not specifically address every contingency, but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress. the capital contingency plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate. see "part i - item 1. - business - regulation" for additional information.     regulatory capital requirements beginning on january 1, 2015, csc became subject to capital requirements set by the federal reserve. in addition, csc is required to serve as a source of strength for schwab bank and to provide financial assistance if schwab bank experiences financial distress. to manage capital adequacy, the company currently utilizes a target tier 1 leverage ratio for csc of at least 6%. due to the relatively low risk of the company's balance sheet assets and risk-based capital ratios at csc and schwab bank that are well in excess of regulatory requirements, the tier 1 leverage ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on csc's asset growth.
schwab bank is also required to maintain capital levels specified by the occ. these capital requirements are substantially similar to those imposed on csc by the federal reserve. schwab bank's failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the bank. the company currently utilizes a target tier 1 leverage ratio for schwab bank of at least 6.25%. as of january 1, 2015, schwab bank became subject to the new final regulatory capital rules set by the occ. based on its regulatory capital ratios at december 31, 2015, schwab bank is considered well capitalized.
the following table details csc's and schwab bank's capital ratios under the new final regulatory capital rules:

the company's broker-dealer subsidiaries (schwab and optionsxpress, inc.) are subject to regulatory requirements of the uniform net capital rule. the rule is intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. these regulations prohibit the broker-dealer subsidiaries from paying cash dividends, making unsecured advances and loans to their parent company and employees, and schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings from csc if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. as such, the broker-dealer subsidiaries are required to maintain, at all times, at least the minimum level of net capital required under rule 15c3-1. at december 31, 2015, schwab and optionsxpress met and exceeded their net capital requirements.

see "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data - consolidated balance sheets and notes to consolidated financial statements - 23. regulatory requirements" for additional information on the components of stockholder's equity and information on the capital requirements of each of the subsidiaries.
in addition to capital requirements, the company's subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure financial soundness and liquidity.
schwab bank is subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions. in addition, schwab bank is required to provide notice to, and may be required to obtain approval from, the occ and the federal reserve to declare dividends to csc.
dividends csc paid common stock cash dividends of $318 million ($0.24 per share) and $316 million ($0.24 per share) in 2015 and 2014, respectively. since the initial dividend in 1989, csc has paid 107 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend rate 19 times, resulting in a 20% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. while the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the board of directors, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, csc currently targets its common stock cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income.
share repurchases there were no repurchases of csc's common stock in 2015 or 2014. as of december 31, 2015, csc had remaining authority from the board of directors to repurchase up to $596 million of its common stock, which is not subject to expiration.         fair value of financial instruments the company uses the market and income approaches to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. see "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - 2. summary of significant accounting policies and 17. fair values of assets and liabilities" for more information on the company's assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.
when available, the company uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. when utilizing market data with a bid-ask spread, the company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. when quoted prices do not exist, the company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. the company generally obtains prices from at least three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value. the company's primary independent pricing service provides prices based on observable trades and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar "to-be-issued" securities. the company compares the prices obtained from its primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. the company does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, the company did not adjust prices received from the primary independent third-party pricing service.

critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. while the majority of the company's revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the company's financial position and reported financial results. these critical accounting estimates are described below. management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company's financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy.
other-than-temporary impairment of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity management evaluates whether securities available for sale and securities held to maturity are other-than-temporarily impaired on a quarterly basis. debt securities with unrealized losses are considered otti if the company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such security before any anticipated recovery. if management determines that a security is otti under these circumstances, the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between the amortized cost and the then-current fair value.
a security is also otti if management does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security. in this circumstance, the impairment recognized in earnings represents the estimated credit loss, and is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security. management utilizes cash flow models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities and to estimate the credit loss. expected cash flows are discounted using the security's effective interest rate.
the evaluation of whether the company expects to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental. the evaluation includes the consideration of multiple factors including: the magnitude and duration of the unrealized loss; the financial condition of the issuer; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings; for asset-backed securities, the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security to absorb credit losses on the underlying collateral; recent events specific to the issuer and the issuer's industry; and whether the company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments.
valuation of goodwill the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, or whenever indications of impairment exist. impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this excess. adverse changes in the company's planned business operations such as unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit, or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the company's recorded goodwill.
the company's annual goodwill impairment testing date is april 1st. in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on april 1, 2015, management performed an assessment of each of the company's reporting units (generally defined as the company's businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and concluded that goodwill was not impaired.
allowance for loan losses the appropriateness of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by management, taking into consideration current economic conditions, the existing loan portfolio composition, past loss experience, and risks inherent in the portfolios.
the methodology to establish an allowance for loan losses related to the first mortgage and heloc portfolios utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and probable losses for the loan segments based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segments. the methodology considers the effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including, but not limited to, interest rates, housing price movements as measured by a housing price index, economic
the charles schwab corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
conditions, estimated defaults and foreclosures measured by historical and expected delinquencies, changes in prepayment speeds, ltv ratios, past loss experience, estimates of future loss severities, borrower credit risk measured by fico scores, and the adequacy of collateral. the methodology also evaluates concentrations in the loan segments including loan products, year of origination, and geographical distribution of collateral.
probable losses are forecast using a loan-level simulation of the delinquency status of the loans over the term of the loans. the simulation starts with the current relevant risk indicators, including the current delinquent status of each loan, the estimated current ltv ratio of each loan, the term and structure of each loan, current key interest rates including u.s. treasury and libor rates, and borrower fico scores. the more significant variables in the simulation include delinquency roll rates, loss severity, housing prices, and interest rates. delinquency roll rates are estimated from the company's historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information. further, the delinquency roll rates within the loan-level simulation discussed above are calibrated to match a moving average of the delinquency roll rates actually experienced in the respective first mortgage and heloc portfolios. loss severity estimates are based on the company's historical loss experience and market trends. the estimated loss severity (i.e., loss given default) used in the allowance for loan loss for helocs is higher than that used for first mortgages. housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values. factors affecting the home price index include: housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations. interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths. this methodology results in loss factors that are applied to the outstanding balances to determine the allowance for loan loss for each loan segment.
legal and regulatory reserves reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, insurance coverage and indemnification, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. in many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change. significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved.
the company's management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee. additionally, management has reviewed with the audit committee the company's significant estimates discussed in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

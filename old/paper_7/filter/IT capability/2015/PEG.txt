our business discussion in item 1. business provides a review of the regions and markets where we operate and compete, as well as our strategy for conducting our businesses within these markets, focusing on operational excellence, financial strength and making disciplined investments. our risk factor discussion in item 1a. risk factors provides information about factors that could have a material adverse impact on our businesses. the following discussion provides an overview of the significant events and business developments that have occurred during 2015 and key factors that we expect may drive our future performance. this discussion refers to the consolidated financial statements (statements) and the related notes to consolidated financial statements (notes). this discussion should be read in conjunction with such statements and notes.
2015 overview our business plan is designed to achieve growth while managing the risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices and changes in customer demand. we continue our focus on operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment. these guiding principles have provided the base from which we have been able to execute our strategic initiatives, including:
•   growing our utility operations through continued investment in t&amp;d and other infrastructure projects, and
•   maintaining and expanding a reliable generation fleet with the flexibility to utilize a diverse mix of fuels which allows us to respond to market volatility and capitalize on opportunities as they arise.
our $161 million 2015 over 2014 increase in net income was due primarily to higher transmission revenues at pse&g, higher mark-to-market (mtm) gains and lower generation costs driven by lower natural gas and coal prices at power and insurance recoveries of superstorm sandy costs, primarily at power. these increases were partially offset by higher pension and other postretirement benefit (opeb) costs and lower capacity revenues and nuclear decommissioning trust (ndt) activity at power. for a more detailed discussion of our financial results, see results of operations.
during 2015, we grew earnings, maintained cash flows and sustained a strong balance sheet. we effectively deployed capital without the need for additional equity, while our solid credit ratings aided our ability to access capital and credit markets. the greater emphasis on capital spending for projects on which we receive contemporaneous returns at pse&g, our regulated utility, in recent years has yielded strong results and allowed us to increase our dividend. these actions to transition our business to meet market conditions and investor expectations reflect our multi-year, long-term approach to managing our company. our focus has been to invest capital in t&d and other infrastructure projects aimed at maintaining service reliability to our customers and bolstering our system resiliency. at power, our merchant generator, we strive to improve performance and reduce costs in order to enhance the value of our generation fleet in light of low gas prices, environmental considerations and competitive market forces that reward efficiency and reliability.
at pse&g, in 2015 we continued to make investments and seek recovery on such investments made to improve the resiliency of our gas and electric distribution system as part of our energy strong program that was approved by the bpu in 2014. as approved, the energy strong program provides for up to $1.2 billion of investment, with cost recovery at a 9.75% rate of return on equity on the first $1.0 billion of the investment, plus associated allowance for funds used during construction, through an accelerated recovery mechanism. we will seek recovery of up to $220 million of investment in pse&g's next base rate case, which is to be filed no later than november 1, 2017.
in november 2015, the bpu approved our settlement with the bpu staff and the new jersey division of rate counsel regarding pse&g's gas system modernization program (gsmp) through which we will invest $905 million over three years to modernize pse&g's gas systems. the order provides for cost recovery at a 9.75% rate of return on equity on the first $650 million of the investment through an accelerated recovery mechanism. pse&g will seek recovery of the remaining $255 million of investment in its next base rate case. for additional information, see item 1. business-regulatory issues-state regulation.
effective january 1, 2015, pse&g's formula rate increased our annual transmission revenues by approximately $182 million. each year, we file estimated transmission revenues subject to true up with actual current year data. the true-up adjustment for 2015, which will be filed in the spring of 2016, will primarily include the impact on rate base of the extension of bonus depreciation, which was enacted after the filing was made, and is estimated to reduce our 2015 annual revenue increase by approximately $21 million. in october 2015, we filed our 2016 annual formula rate update with ferc, which will provide $146 million in increased annual transmission revenues effective january 1, 2016. our 2016 transmission revenues will be adjusted for the impact of the continued extension of bonus depreciation, which was enacted after our 2016 filing was made, and is estimated to reduce our 2016 revenues as filed by approximately $27 million.
during 2015, power successfully improved its performance for both nuclear and fossil operations, with continued upgrades in efficiency and output, while mitigating environmental impacts. power's results benefited from access to natural gas supplies through its existing firm pipeline transportation contracts. power manages these contracts for the benefit of pse&g's customers through the basic gas supply service (bgss) arrangement. the contracts are sized to ensure delivery of a reliable gas supply to pse&g customers on peak winter days. when pipeline capacity beyond the customers' needs is available, power can use it to
table of contents make third party sales and supply gas to its generating units in new jersey. power's strategic hedging practices and ability to use market conditions to its advantage help it to balance some of the volatility of the merchant power business.
three recent investments reflect our recognition of the value of opportunistic growth in the power business. in june 2015, we acquired a development project to construct a 755 mw gas-fired combined cycle generating station (keys energy center) in maryland with completion expected in 2018 at an estimated investment of $825 million - $875 million. in august 2015, we announced our plan to construct sewaren 7, a new 540 mw dual-fueled combined cycle generating plant in woodbridge, new jersey, scheduled to be in-service for the summer of 2018 at an estimated investment of $625 million - $675 million. the sewaren 7 plant will replace sewaren units 1, 2, 3 and 4. in february 2016, we announced our plan to build bridgeport harbor station 5 (bh5), a 485 mw gas-fired combined cycle generating plant on our existing bridgeport harbor station site in bridgeport, connecticut scheduled to be in-service for the summer of 2019 at an estimated investment of more than $550 million. these additions to our fleet expand our geographic diversity and are expected to contribute to the overall efficiency of operations.
in the pjm capacity auction held in august 2015 for the 2018-2019 delivery year, power cleared 8,634 mw of its generating capacity at an average price of $215 mw-day. the capacity that power cleared for the 2018-2019 delivery year included sewaren 7 and keys energy center generation plants. in the two prior pjm capacity auctions covering the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 delivery years, power cleared approximately 8,700 mw at average prices of $172 mw-day and $177 mw-day, respectively. in the iso-ne auction held in february 2016, power cleared bh5 at an average price of $232 mw-day for the 2019-2020 delivery year.
regulatory, legislative and other developments in our pursuit of operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment, we closely monitor and engage with stakeholders on significant regulatory and legislative developments. transmission planning rules and wholesale power market design are of particular importance to our results and we continue to advocate for policies and rules that promote fair and efficient electricity markets.
transmission planning ferc's rule under order 1000 altered the right of first refusal (rofr) previously held by incumbent utilities to build transmission within their respective service territories, creating the potential that new transmission projects in our service territory could be assigned to third parties rather than pse&g. order 1000 also presents opportunities for us to construct transmission outside of our service territory. in april 2013, pjm interconnection, l.l.c. (pjm) initiated a solicitation process to allow both incumbents and non-incumbents the opportunity to submit transmission project proposals to address identified high voltage issues at artificial island in new jersey. in august 2015, pjm awarded pse&g three components of the transmission project, estimated by pjm to cost approximately $126 million. pse&g has accepted construction responsibility, subject to reaching agreement with pjm on a reasonable cost estimate. discussions are ongoing with pjm regarding the cost estimate for pse&g's portion of the work. see item 1. business-regulatory issues-federal regulation-transmission regulation for additional information.
there are several matters pending before ferc that concern the allocation of costs associated with transmission projects being constructed by pse&g. regardless of how these proceedings are resolved, pse&g's ability to recover the costs of these projects will not be affected. however, the result of these proceedings could ultimately impact the amount of costs borne by ratepayers in new jersey and may cause increased scrutiny regarding pse&g's future capital investments. in addition, power, as a basic generation service (bgs) supplier, submits bids into the auction and obtains an obligation to provide services that include specified transmission costs. if the allocation of the costs associated with the transmission projects were to increase these transmission costs, bgs suppliers may be entitled to an adjustment. however, suppliers may not be able to recoup these adjustments immediately as they are subject to bpu approval. we do not believe that these matters will have a material effect on power's financial statements.
wholesale power market design capacity market design, including the reliability pricing model (rpm) in pjm, remains an important focus for us. in may 2014, a federal court issued a rule that vacated a ferc order in which ferc had determined that demand response (dr) providers should receive full market compensation for power and held that ferc has no jurisdiction over dr. in january 2016, the u.s. supreme court overturned the federal court's decision which removed any risk to dr's participation in the energy and capacity markets.
in a separate development of significance to the wholesale capacity market, in december 2014 pjm filed at ferc its proposal for a capacity performance (cp) product to include generators, dr and energy efficiency providers, which will be required to perform during emergency conditions, as a supplement to the base capacity product. the proposal included enhanced performance-based incentives and penalties. in june 2015, ferc conditionally accepted the proposal and the cp mechanism was implemented for the 2015 capacity auction noted above. we believe that the auction pricing adequately reflects the
table of contents increased costs that could result from operating under more stringent rules for generation availability. based on the auction results, the cp mechanism appears to have provided the opportunity for enhanced capacity market revenue streams for power, but future impacts cannot be assured. further, there may be requirements for additional investment and there are additional performance risks.
applications for rehearing of ferc's capacity performance order are pending. see item 1. business-regulatory issues-federal regulation-capacity market issues for additional information.
we have also been actively involved both through stakeholder processes and through filings at ferc in seeking improvements to the rules for setting prices for energy in the day-ahead and real-time markets administered by pjm and other system operators. a november 2015 development which we view as positive involves both a notice of proposed rulemaking on dispatch intervals and scarcity pricing and a separate order directing the system operators to submit reports on five other price formation issues. we believe that, if implemented, these changes will improve energy price formation in the future.
see item 1. business-regulatory issues-federal regulation-price formation initiatives for additional information.
an emerging issue in pjm involves the impact of subsidized existing generation on rpm market outcomes. these subsidies would likely enable the affected generators to submit reduced bids into pjm capacity markets that are not reflective of their actual costs of operation and may prevent uneconomic generating facilities from retiring. either of these conditions could artificially suppress capacity market prices, especially given that pjm's currently effective "minimum offer price rule" (mopr) would not apply to these plants because it only applies to new gas-fired units. see item 1. business-regulatory issues-federal regulation-capacity market issues for additional information.
environmental regulation we continue to advocate for the development and implementation of fair and reasonable rules by the epa and state environmental regulators. in particular, section 316(b) of the federal water pollution control act (fwpca) requires that cooling water intake structures, which are a significant part of the generation of electricity at steam-electric generating stations, reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. implementation of section 316(b) could adversely impact future nuclear and fossil operations and costs. in june 2015, the new jersey department of environmental protection (njdep) issued a draft new jersey pollutant discharge elimination system (njpdes) permit governing cooling water intake structures for salem. the draft permit does not require installation of cooling towers and allows salem to continue to operate utilizing the existing once-through cooling water system with certain required system modifications. the njdep may make revisions before issuing the final permit which is expected during the first half of 2016. for additional information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities.
in october 2015, the epa published the clean power plan (cpp), a greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions regulation under the clean air act (caa) for existing power plants. the regulation establishes state-specific emission targets based on implementation of the best systems of emission reduction. each state must submit a compliance plan to the epa by september 6, 2016 or seek a two-year extension to september 6, 2018. we continue to work with ferc and other federal and state regulators, as well as industry partners, to determine the potential impact of these regulations. numerous states, including new jersey and several industry groups, filed petitions for review with the d.c. court to challenge the cpp. in addition, the petitioners sought a stay of the rule. on january 21, 2016, the d.c. court declined to stay the cpp. however, on february 9, 2016, the u.s. supreme court stayed the rule pending further review of the case.
the u.s. supreme court's decision to stay the implementation of the cpp will delay deadlines for submission of state requests for extensions and final plans. if the cpp is upheld, new deadlines will need to be established and the effective date of the compliance period may be impacted. see item 1. business-environmental matters-climate change for additional information.
caa regulations governing hazardous air pollutants under the epa's maximum achievable control technology rules are also of significance; however, we believe our generation business remains well-positioned for such regulations if and when they are implemented. in addition, state environmental regulations governing emissions from power plants also have a significant impact on our operations. in the second quarter of 2015, we retired 1,545 mw of fully depreciated combustion turbine capacity that would not be able to comply with the more stringent emission standards for high electric demand day units (hedd) under the new jersey hedd regulations for nitrous oxide, which reduces our capacity revenues.
we are subject to liability under environmental laws for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by us and of property contaminated by hazardous substances that we generated. in particular, the historic operations of pseg companies and the operations of numerous other companies along the passaic and hackensack rivers are alleged by federal and state agencies to have discharged substantial contamination into the passaic river/newark bay complex in violation of various statutes. we are also currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where other hazardous substances may have been discharged and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future, and the costs of any such remediation efforts could be material.
table of contents for further information regarding the matters described above as well as other matters that may impact our financial condition and results of operations, see item 1. business-environmental matters, item 3. legal proceedings, and item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities.
ferc compliance the ferc staff has initiated a preliminary non-public investigation regarding errors in the calculation of certain components of power's cost-based bids for its new jersey fossil generating units in the pjm energy market and the quantity of energy that power offered into the energy market for its fossil peaking units compared to the amounts for which power was compensated in the capacity market for those units. this investigation is ongoing. the amounts of potential disgorgement and other potential penalties that we may incur span a wide range depending on the success of our legal arguments. if our legal arguments do not prevail, in whole or in part with ferc or in a judicial challenge that we may choose to pursue, it is likely that power would record losses that would be material to pseg's and power's results of operations in the quarterly and annual periods in which they are recorded. for additional information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities.
bonus depreciation in december 2015, congress passed the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 (tax act). the tax act includes an extension of the bonus depreciation rules. for federal tax purposes, bonus depreciation allows a tax deduction equal to the applicable percentage of qualifying assets that are placed in service during the applicable year. the extension of bonus depreciation associated with changes under the tax act is expected to reduce the rate of growth in pse&g's rate base given an anticipated increase in deferred taxes; it is also expected to have a significant cash benefit over the next several years. for more detailed information, refer to item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 19. income taxes.
change in accounting estimate at the end of 2015, we changed the approach used to measure future service and interest costs for pension and other post-retirement benefits. for 2015 and prior, we calculated service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. for 2016 and beyond, we have elected to calculate service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows. we believe the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans' liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. this change does not affect the measurement of the plan obligations. as a change in accounting estimate, this change will be reflected prospectively. we estimate this will reduce 2016 pension and opeb expense by approximately $34 million and $13 million, respectively, net of amounts capitalized.
operational excellence we emphasize operational performance while developing opportunities in both our competitive and regulated businesses. flexibility in our generating fleet has allowed us to take advantage of market opportunities presented during the year as we remain diligent in managing costs. in 2015, our
•   total nuclear fleet achieved an average capacity factor of 90%,
•   nuclear output increased by 3.1% and combined cycle output by 11.4%, (including record performance at the linden units 1 and 2 and the bethlehem energy center (bec) combined cycle units) as compared to the same period in 2014,
•   diverse fuel mix and dispatch flexibility allowed us to generate approximately 55 twh while addressing unit outages and balancing fuel availability and price volatility, and
•   utility ranked highest in electric and gas service business customer satisfaction among large utilities in the eastern united states and was recognized as the most reliable utility in the mid-atlantic region.
financial strength our financial strength is predicated on a solid balance sheet, positive cash flow and reasonable risk-adjusted returns on increased investment. our financial position remained strong during 2015 as we:
•   maintained solid investment grade credit ratings,
•   extended the expiration dates for approximately $2.0 billion of five-year credit facilities for pseg, pse&amp;g and power from 2018 to 2020,
•   received cash federal tax benefits from the extension of bonus depreciation, and
we expect to be able to fund our transmission projects required under pjm's reliability program, energy strong distribution program, gsmp, keys energy center, sewaren 7, bh5 and other planned projects, without the issuance of new equity.
disciplined investment we utilize rigorous investment criteria when deploying capital and seek to invest in areas that complement our existing business and provide reasonable risk-adjusted returns. these areas include upgrading our energy infrastructure, responding to trends in environmental protection and providing new energy supplies in domestic markets with growing demand. in 2015, we commenced construction of the keys energy center in maryland and sewaren 7 in new jersey, each of which generating station cleared in the 2018/2019 capacity auction. in addition, we:
•   made additional investments in transmission infrastructure projects,
•   secured approval to extend three energy efficiency economic stimulus subprograms to allow for additional capital expenditures and administrative expenses to provide energy efficiency assistance to hospitals, healthcare facilities and residential multi-family housing units,
•   received approval for our gsmp and continued to execute our energy strong and other existing bpu-approved utility programs,
•   completed installation of equipment to increase output and improve efficiency at our bergen 2 combined cycle gas unit similar to our 2014 installation at our linden plant, and
•   placed into service a 13 mw-direct current (dc) solar energy facility near waldorf, maryland, acquired and placed into service a 25 mw-dc solar energy facility near san francisco, california and acquired a 63 mw-dc solar energy project near salt lake city, utah which is expected to be in-service by the end of 2016.
in february 2016, we announced our plan to commence construction of bh5 in 2017, with operations expected to begin in mid-2019. see financial results above for additional information.
future outlook our future success will depend on our ability to continue to maintain strong operational and financial performance in a slow-moving economy and a cost-constrained environment with low gas prices, to capitalize on or otherwise address appropriately regulatory and legislative developments that impact our business and to respond to the issues and challenges described below. in order to do this, we must continue to:
•   focus on controlling costs while maintaining safety and reliability and complying with applicable standards and requirements,
•   successfully manage our energy obligations and re-contract our open supply positions,
•   execute our utility capital investment program, including our energy strong program, gsmp and other investments for growth that yield contemporaneous and reasonable risk-adjusted returns, while enhancing the resiliency of our infrastructure and maintaining the reliability of the service we provide to our customers,
•   advocate for measures to ensure the implementation by pjm and ferc of market design and transmission planning rules that continue to promote fair and efficient electricity markets,
•   regulatory and political uncertainty, both with regard to future energy policy, design of energy and capacity markets, transmission policy and environmental regulation, as well as with respect to the outcome of any legal, regulatory or other proceeding, settlement, investigation or claim, applicable to us and/or the energy industry,
•   ferc staff's continuing investigation of certain of power's new jersey fossil generating unit bids in the pjm energy market,
•   the potential for continued reductions in demand and sustained lower natural gas and electricity prices, both at market hubs and the locations where we operate, and
•   delays and other obstacles that might arise in connection with the construction of our t&amp;d, generation and other development projects, including in connection with permitting and regulatory approvals.
our primary investment opportunities are in two areas: our regulated utility business and our merchant power business. we continually assess a broad range of strategic options to maximize long-term stockholder value. in assessing our options, we consider a wide variety of factors, including the performance and prospects of our businesses; the views of investors, regulators and rating agencies; our existing indebtedness and restrictions it imposes; and tax considerations, among other things. strategic options available to us include:
•   the acquisition, construction or disposition of transmission and distribution facilities and/or generation units,
•   the disposition or reorganization of our merchant generation business or other existing businesses or the acquisition of new businesses,
•   investments in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits, improvements to system resiliency and modernizing existing infrastructure.
there can be no assurance, however, that we will successfully develop and execute any of the strategic options noted above, or any additional options we may consider in the future. the execution of any such strategic plan may not have the expected benefits or may have unexpected adverse consequences.
(a)   power's results in 2015 include an after-tax insurance recovery for superstorm sandy of $102 million. power's 2014 and 2013 results include after-tax expenses of $17 million and $32 million, respectively, for operation and maintenance (o&amp;m) costs net of insurance recoveries in 2013, due to severe damage caused by superstorm sandy. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities.

the 2015 and 2014 amounts in the preceding table for operating revenues and o&m costs each include $375 million and $389 million, respectively, for servco. these amounts represent the o&m pass-through costs for the long island operations, the full reimbursement of which is reflected in operating revenues. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 3. variable interest entities for further explanation. the following discussions for pse&g and power provide a detailed explanation of their respective variances.
operating revenues decreased $130 million due primarily to changes in delivery, clause, commodity and other operating revenues.
clause revenues decreased $154 million due primarily to lower securitization transition charge (stc) revenues of $86 million, lower societal benefit charges (sbc) of $31 million, lower margin adjustment clause (mac) of $29 million, and lower solar pilot recovery charges (sprc) of $8 million. the changes in stc, sbc, mac and sprc amounts were entirely offset by the amortization of related costs (regulatory assets) in o&m, depreciation and amortization and interest expense. pse&g does not earn margin on stc, sbc, mac or sprc collections.
commodity revenue decreased $187 million due to lower gas revenues, partially offset by higher electric revenues. this is entirely offset with decreased energy costs. pse&g earns no margin on the provision of bgs and bgss to retail customers.
•   electric revenues increased $79 million due primarily to $120 million in higher net bgs revenues, comprised of $166 million from higher sales volumes, partially offset by lower prices of $46 million. bgs sales volume increased due primarily to weather. the bgs net revenue increase was partially offset by $41 million in lower revenues from the sale of non-utility generation (nug) energy and collections of non-utility generation charges (ngc) due primarily to lower prices.
operating expenses energy costs decreased $187 million. this is entirely offset by commodity revenue.
•   $33 million in pension and opeb expenses, net of amounts capitalized,
•   a $49 million net increase due primarily to various increases, including information technology expenditures, wages, appliance service costs and preventative maintenance,
•   almost entirely offset by a $90 million net reduction in costs related to various clause mechanisms, gprc and the capital infrastructure program (cip), and
depreciation and amortization decreased $14 million due primarily to a $69 million decrease in amortization of regulatory assets, partially offset by an increase in depreciation of $55 million due to additional plant in service.
•   partially offset by a decrease of $17 million due to the redemption of securitization debt in 2015.
operating revenues increased $111 million due primarily to changes in delivery, clause, commodity and other operating revenues.
•   gas distribution revenues decreased $5 million due primarily to lower wnc revenue of $32 million due to more normal weather compared to the prior year, lower transitional energy facilities assessment (tefa) revenue of $22 million due to elimination of tefa tax effective january 1, 2014, lower cip related revenue of $11 million, partially offset by higher sales volumes of $54 million, and higher revenue from gprc of $6 million.
commodity revenues increased $68 million due to lower electric and gas revenues. this is entirely offset with increased energy costs. pse&g earns no margin on the provision of bgs and bgss to retail customers.
operating expenses energy costs increased $68 million. this is entirely offset by commodity revenues.
•   $73 million in pension and opeb expenses, net of amounts capitalized, and
depreciation and amortization increased $34 million due primarily to increases of $47 million in additional plant in service partially offset by a $15 million decrease in amortization of regulatory assets.
•   $16 million due to partial redemption of securitization debt of in 2014,
•   $25 million due to maturities of $725 million in 2013, and

•   a decrease of $192 million due primarily to lower capacity revenues resulting from lower average auction prices and the retirement of older peaking units in june 2015, coupled with lower ancillary and operating reserve revenues in the pjm region, and
•   partially offset by an increase of $56 million due primarily to higher volumes of electricity sold under wholesale load contracts in the pjm and ne regions coupled with higher average prices in the ne region, and
•   an increase of $37 million due primarily to higher volumes of electricity sold under the bgs contract at higher average prices.
operating expenses energy costs represent the cost of generation, which includes fuel costs for generation as well as purchased energy in the market, and gas purchases to meet power's obligation under its bgss contract with pse&g. energy costs decreased $597 million due to
•   partially offset by an increase of $51 million at our nuclear facilities, primarily due to higher planned outage costs at our 100%-owned hope creek and 50%-owned peach bottom 3 nuclear plants in 2015 as compared to our 57%-owned salem nuclear unit 2 in 2014, and
•   a $30 million increase due to higher pension and opeb costs, net of amounts capitalized.
other-than-temporary impairments increased $33 million due primarily to an increase in impairments of equity securities in the ndt fund.
•   higher revenues of $366 million due primarily to mtm gains in 2014 resulting from a decrease in prices on forward positions and higher energy volumes sold in the ny and ne regions, and
•   partially offset by a decrease of $89 million due to lower volumes of electricity sold as a result of serving fewer tranches in 2014 under our bgs contracts and lower average pricing, and
other operating revenues increased $15 million due to transition fees related to fuel management and power supply management contracts with lipa.
operating expenses energy costs represent the cost of generation, which includes fuel costs for generation as well as purchased energy in the market, and gas purchases to meet power's obligation under its bgss contract with pse&g. energy costs increased $251 million due to
•   generation costs increased $252 million due primarily to higher fuel costs, reflecting higher average realized natural gas prices, the unfavorable mtm impact from lower average natural gas prices on forward positions and the utilization of higher volumes of gas and oil. these increased costs were partially offset by lower congestion costs in the pjm region.
•   lower pension and opeb costs, net of amounts capitalized of $42 million,
•   a decrease of $15 million due primarily to the outage of our 100%-owned hope creek nuclear facility in the fall of 2013, which was partially offset by the extension of our 57%-owned nuclear salem unit 2 refueling outage in 2014, and
•   partially offset by an increase of $40 million related primarily to higher planned outage and maintenance costs at our fossil plants, including maintenance and installation of upgraded technology at our linden combined cycle gas generating plant and outages at our keystone and hudson facilities.
interest expense increased $6 million due primarily to the issuance of a $250 million 2.45% senior note and a $250 million 4.30% senior note in november 2013, partially offset by the maturity of $300 million of 2.50% senior notes in april 2013.
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion of our liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis, noting the uses and contributions, where material, of our two direct major operating subsidiaries.
financing methodology we expect our capital requirements to be met through internally generated cash flows and external financings, consisting of short-term debt for working capital needs and long-term debt for capital investments.
pse&g's sources of external liquidity include a $600 million multi-year syndicated credit facility. pse&g's commercial paper program is the primary vehicle for meeting seasonal, intra-month and temporary working capital needs. pse&g does not engage in any intercompany borrowing or lending arrangements. pse&g maintains back-up facilities in an amount sufficient to cover the commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding. pse&g's dividend payments to pseg are consistent with its capital structure objectives which have been established to maintain investment grade credit ratings. pse&g's long-term financing plan is designed to replace maturities, fund a portion of its capital program and manage short-term debt balances. generally, pse&g uses either secured medium-term notes or first mortgage bonds to raise long-term capital.
pseg, power, energy holdings, pseg li and services participate in a corporate money pool, an aggregation of daily cash balances designed to efficiently manage their respective short-term liquidity needs. servco does not participate in the corporate money pool. servco's short-term liquidity needs are met through an account funded and owned by lipa.
pseg's sources of external liquidity may include the issuance of long-term debt securities and the incurrence of additional indebtedness under credit facilities. our current sources of external liquidity include multi-year syndicated credit facilities totaling $1 billion. these facilities are available to back-stop pseg's commercial paper program, issue letters of credit and for general corporate purposes. these facilities may also be used to provide support to pseg's subsidiaries. pseg's credit facilities and the commercial paper program are available to support pseg working capital needs or to temporarily fund growth opportunities in advance of obtaining permanent financing. pseg also has a $500 million term loan credit agreement that is scheduled to expire in november 2017. from time to time, pseg may make equity contributions or provide credit support to its subsidiaries.
power's sources of external liquidity include $2.6 billion of syndicated multi-year credit facilities. additionally, from time to time, power maintains bilateral credit agreements designed to enhance its liquidity position. credit capacity is primarily used to provide collateral in support of power's forward energy sale and forward fuel purchase contracts as the market prices for energy and fuel fluctuate, and to meet potential collateral postings in the event of a credit rating downgrade below investment grade. power's dividend payments to pseg are also designed to be consistent with its capital structure objectives which have been established to maintain investment grade credit ratings and provide sufficient financial flexibility. generally, power issues senior unsecured debt to raise long-term capital.
table of contents operating cash flows we expect our operating cash flows combined with cash on hand and financing activities to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and shareholder dividend payments.
•   an increase of $83 million due to decrease in employee benefit plan funding,
•   a decrease in margin deposit requirements of $144 million, and
short-term liquidity we continually monitor our liquidity and seek to add capacity as needed to meet our liquidity requirements. each of our credit facilities is restricted as to availability and use to the specific companies as listed below; however, if necessary, the pseg facilities can also be used to support our subsidiaries' liquidity needs. our total credit facilities and available liquidity as of december 31, 2015 were as follows:
table of contents company/facility                                                       as of december 31, 2015
totalfacility                                 usage              availableliquidity millions pseg                          $1,000                $221                             $779
as of december 31, 2015, our credit facility capacity was in excess of our projected maximum liquidity requirements over our 12 month planning horizon. our maximum liquidity requirements are based on stress scenarios that incorporate changes in commodity prices and the potential impact of power losing its investment grade credit rating. pseg's credit facilities are available to back-stop its commercial paper program and issue letters of credit under which as of december 31, 2015, $211 million of commercial paper was outstanding. pse&g's credit facility primary use is to support its commercial paper program under which as of december 31, 2015, $153 million was outstanding. most of our credit facilities expire in 2019 and 2020. for additional information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities and note 13. schedule of consolidated debt.
for a discussion of our long-term debt transactions during 2015 and into 2016, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 13. schedule of consolidated debt.
debt covenants our credit agreements contain maximum debt to equity ratios and other restrictive covenants and conditions to borrowing. we are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants. continued compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon our future financial position, level of earnings and cash flows, as to which no assurances can be given.
in addition, under its first and refunding mortgage (mortgage), pse&g may issue new first and refunding mortgage bonds against previous additions and improvements, provided that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges calculated in accordance with its mortgage is at least 2 to 1, and/or against retired mortgage bonds. as of december 31, 2015, pse&g's mortgage coverage ratio was 3.87 to 1 and the mortgage would permit up to approximately $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of new mortgage bonds to be issued against additions and improvements to its property.
default provisions our bank credit agreements and indentures contain various, customary default provisions that could result in the potential acceleration of indebtedness under the defaulting company's agreement. we have not defaulted under these agreements.
in particular, pseg's bank credit agreements contain provisions under which certain events, including an acceleration of material indebtedness under pse&g's and power's respective financing agreements, a failure by pse&g or power to satisfy certain final judgments and certain bankruptcy events by pse&g or power, that would constitute an event of default under the pseg bank credit agreements. under the pseg bank credit agreements, it would also be an event of default if either pse&g or power ceases to be wholly owned by pseg. the pse&g and power bank credit agreements include similar default provisions; however such provisions only relate to the respective borrower under such agreement and its subsidiaries and do not contain cross default provisions to each other. the pse&g and power bank credit agreements do not include cross default provisions relating to pseg.
ratings triggers our debt indentures and credit agreements do not contain any material 'ratings triggers' that would cause an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade. however, in the event of a downgrade, any one or more of the affected companies may be subject to increased interest costs on certain bank debt and certain collateral
table of contents requirements. in the event that we are not able to affirm representations and warranties on credit agreements, lenders would not be required to make loans.
in accordance with bpu requirements under the bgs contracts, pse&g is required to maintain an investment grade credit rating. if pse&g were to lose its investment grade rating, it would be required to file a plan to assure continued payment for the bgs requirements of its customers.
fluctuations in commodity prices or a deterioration of power's credit rating to below investment grade could increase power's required margin postings under various agreements entered into in the normal course of business. power believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet the required posting of collateral which would likely result from a credit rating downgrade at today's market prices.
on february 16, 2016, our board of directors approved a $0.41 per share common stock dividend for the first quarter of 2016. this reflects an indicative annual dividend rate of $1.64 per share. we expect to continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our businesses, alternate investment opportunities, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant.
credit ratings if the rating agencies lower or withdraw our credit ratings, such revisions may adversely affect the market price of our securities and serve to materially increase our cost of capital and limit access to capital. credit ratings shown are for securities that we typically issue. outlooks are shown for corporate credit ratings (s&p) and issuer credit ratings (moody's) and can be stable, negative, or positive. there is no assurance that the ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be revised by the rating agencies, if, in their respective judgments, circumstances warrant. each rating given by an agency should be evaluated independently of the other agencies' ratings. the ratings should not be construed as an indication to buy, hold or sell any security.
in may 2015, moody's published research reports on pseg, pse&g and power and the existing ratings and outlooks were unchanged. in may 2015, s&p published updated research reports and revised the outlook to stable from positive for pseg's corporate credit rating and power's senior notes. s&p also affirmed the senior unsecured rating of bbb+ at power and the mortgage bond rating of a at pse&g. in september 2015, moody's published an updated research report on pseg and revised the outlook to positive from stable. in september and october 2015, fitch published full rating reports on pseg and power leaving ratings and outlooks unchanged. in october 2015, pseg ended a contractual agreement with fitch to provide credit rating services for pseg, pse&g and power. in january 2016, s&p published updated research reports on pseg and pse&g and the existing ratings and outlooks were unchanged.

(b)   s&amp;p ratings range from aaa (highest) to d (lowest) for long-term securities and a1 (highest) to d (lowest) for short-term securities. the corporate credit rating outlook does not apply to pseg's or pse&amp;g's commercial paper rating or pse&amp;g's mortgage bond rating.
other comprehensive income for the year ended december 31, 2015, we had other comprehensive loss of $12 million on a consolidated basis. other comprehensive loss was due primarily to a $27 million decrease in net unrealized gains related to available-for-sale securities and $10 million of unrealized losses on derivative contracts accounted for as hedges, partially offset by a $25 million decrease in our consolidated liability for pension and postretirement benefits. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 20. accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax for additional information.
capital requirements it is expected that all of our capital requirements over the next three years will come from a combination of internally generated funds and external debt financing. projected capital construction and investment expenditures, excluding nuclear fuel purchases, for the next three years are presented in the table below. these projections include allowance for funds used during construction and interest capitalized during construction for pse&g and power, respectively. these amounts are subject to change, based on various factors. we will continue to approach non-regulated solar and other renewable investments opportunistically, seeking projects that will provide attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.

pse&g pse&g's projections for future capital expenditures include material additions and replacements to its transmission and distribution systems to meet expected growth and to manage reliability. as project scope and cost estimates develop, pse&g will modify its current projections to include these required investments. pse&g's projected expenditures for the various items reported above are primarily comprised of the following:
•   transmission-investments focused on reliability improvements and replacement of aging infrastructure.
•   baseline-investments for new business, reliability improvements, and replacement of defective equipment.
•   energy strong-electric and gas distribution reliability investment program focused on system hardening and resiliency.
•   solar/energy efficiency-investments associated with grid-connected solar, solar loan programs, and customer energy efficiency programs.
in 2015, pse&g made $2,692 million of capital expenditures, primarily for transmission and distribution system reliability. this does not include expenditures for cost of removal, net of salvage, of $120 million, which are included in operating cash flows.
power power's projected expenditures for the various items listed above are primarily comprised of the following:
•   fossil growth opportunities-investments associated with new construction, including keys energy center, sewaren 7 and bh5, and with upgrades to increase efficiency and output at combined cycle plants.
•   nuclear expansion-investments associated with certain nuclear capital projects, primarily at existing facilities designed to increase operating output.
•   solar growth opportunities-investments associated with the construction of utility-scale photovoltaic facilities.
in 2015, power made $881 million of capital expenditures, excluding $236 million for nuclear fuel, primarily related to various projects at fossil and nuclear.
disclosures about long-term maturities, contractual and commercial obligations and certain investments the following table reflects our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments in the respective periods in which they are due. in addition, the table summarizes anticipated recourse and non-recourse debt maturities for the years shown. for additional information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 13. schedule of consolidated debt.
the table below does not reflect any anticipated cash payments for pension obligations due to uncertain timing of payments or liabilities for uncertain tax positions since we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of liability payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 19. income taxes for additional information.

other through energy holdings, we have investments in leveraged leases that are accounted for in accordance with gaap accounting for leases. leveraged lease investments generally involve three parties: an owner/lessor, a creditor and a lessee. in a typical leveraged lease arrangement, the lessor purchases an asset to be leased. the purchase price is typically financed 80% with debt provided by the creditor and the balance comes from equity funds provided by the lessor. the creditor provides long-term financing to the transaction secured by the property subject to the lease. such long-term financing is non-recourse to the lessor and is not presented on our consolidated balance sheets. in the event of default, the leased asset, and in some cases the lessee, secures the loan. as a lessor, energy holdings has ownership rights to the property and rents the property to the lessees for use in their business operations. for additional information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 6. long-term investments and note 7. financing receivables.
in the event that collection of the minimum lease payments to be received by energy holdings is no longer reasonably assured, energy holdings may deem that a lessee has a high probability of defaulting on the lease obligation, and would consider the need to record an impairment of its investment. in the event the lease is ultimately rejected by a bankruptcy court, the fair value of the underlying asset and the associated debt would be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets instead of the net equity investment in the lease.
critical accounting estimates under gaap, many accounting standards require the use of estimates, variable inputs and assumptions (collectively referred to as estimates) that are subjective in nature. because of this, differences between the actual measure realized versus the estimate can have a material impact on results of operations, financial position and cash flows. we have determined that the following estimates are considered critical to the application of rules that relate to the respective businesses.
accounting for pensions pseg sponsors several qualified and nonqualified pension plans covering pseg's and its participating affiliates' current and former employees who meet certain eligibility criteria. the market-related value of plan assets held for the qualified pension plan is equal to the fair value of these assets as of year-end. the plan assets are comprised of investments in both debt and equity securities which are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. we calculate pension costs using various economic and demographic assumptions.
assumptions and approach used: economic assumptions include the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on trust assets. demographic assumptions include projections of future mortality rates, pay increases and retirement patterns.
the discount rate used to calculate pension obligations is determined as of december 31 each year, our measurement date. the discount rate is determined by developing a spot rate curve based on the yield to maturity of a universe of high quality corporate bonds with similar maturities to the plan obligations. the spot rates are used to discount the estimated plan distributions. the discount rate is the single equivalent rate that produces the same result as the full spot rate curve.
at the end of 2015, we changed the approach used to measure future service and interest costs for pension benefits. for 2015 and prior, we calculated service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. for 2016 and beyond, we have elected to calculate service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows. we believe the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans' liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. this change does not affect the measurement of the plan obligations. as a change in accounting estimate, this change will be reflected prospectively. we estimate this will reduce 2016 pension expense by approximately $47
table of contents million or $34 million, net of amounts capitalized, as compared to the 2016 amount that would have been derived from applying our 2015 and prior years' methodology.
based on the above assumptions, we have estimated net periodic pension expense in 2016 of approximately $56 million or $40 million, net of amounts capitalized.
we utilize a corridor approach that reduces the volatility of reported pension expense/income. the corridor requires differences between actuarial assumptions and plan results be deferred and amortized as part of expense/income. this occurs only when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the pension benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets as of each year-end. the excess would be amortized over the average remaining service period of the active employees, which is approximately eight years.
effect if different assumptions used: as part of the business planning process, we have modeled future costs assuming an 8.00% rate of return and a 4.54% discount rate for 2016. actual future pension expense/income and funding levels will depend on future investment performance, changes in discount rates, market conditions, funding levels relative to our projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans.
the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain assumptions. the effects of the assumption changes shown below solely reflect the impact of that specific assumption.

see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information.
we have entered into various derivative instruments to manage risk from changes in commodity prices and interest rates. in accordance with our hedging strategy, derivatives that are hedging these risks and qualify are designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. for derivatives designated as hedges, the change in the value of a derivative instrument is measured against the offsetting change in the value of the underlying contract, anticipated transaction or other business condition that the derivative instrument is intended to hedge. this is known as the measure of hedge effectiveness. changes in the fair value of the effective portion of a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings. changes in the fair value of the effective portion of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. any hedge ineffectiveness is included in current period earnings. during periods of extreme price volatility, there will be significant changes in the value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). as of december 31, 2015, we had no commodity contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
for our wholesale energy business, many of the forward sale, forward purchase, option and other contracts are derivative instruments that hedge commodity price risk, but do not meet the requirements for either cash flow or fair value hedge
table of contents accounting. the changes in value of such derivative contracts are marked to market through earnings as the related commodity prices fluctuate. as a result, our earnings may experience significant fluctuations depending on the volatility of commodity prices.
effect if different assumptions used: any significant changes to the fair market values of our derivatives instruments could result in a material change in the value of the assets or liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and could result in a material change to the unrealized gains or losses recorded in our consolidated statements of operations.
for additional information regarding derivative financial instruments, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 15. financial risk management activities.
long-lived assets in accordance with gaap, management evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in regulation, business climate or market conditions, could potentially indicate an asset's or asset group's carrying amount may not be recoverable.
assumptions and approach used: in the event certain triggers exist indicating an asset/asset group may not be recoverable, an undiscounted cash flow test is performed to determine if an impairment exists. when the carrying value of a long-lived asset/asset group exceeds the undiscounted estimate of future cash flows associated with the asset/asset group, an impairment may exist to the extent that the fair value of the asset/asset group is less than its carrying amount. these tests require significant estimates and judgment when developing expected future cash flows; however, generating units are typically evaluated at a regional portfolio level.
effect if different assumptions used: the above cash flow tests and fair value estimates may be impacted by changes in forecasted power prices, fuel costs, dispatch rates, other operating and capital expenditures and the cost of borrowing which if different, could significantly impact the outcome, triggering additional impairment tests or write-offs.
lease investments our investments in leases, included in long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets, are comprised of lease receivables (net of non-recourse debt), the estimated residual value of leased assets, and unearned and deferred income. a significant portion of the estimated residual value of leased assets is related to merchant power plants leased to other energy companies. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 6. long-term investments and note 7. financing receivables.
•   estimated forward power and capacity prices in the years after the lease,
•   future capital expenditures required to maintain the plants,
effect if different assumptions used: a significant change to the assumptions, such as a large decrease in near-term power prices that affects the market's view of long-term power prices, or a change in the credit rating or bankruptcy of a counterparty, could result in an impairment of one or more of the residual values, but not necessarily to all of the residual values. however, if, because of changes in assumptions, all the residual values related to the merchant energy plants were deemed to be zero, we would recognize an after-tax charge to income of approximately $177 million.
pse&g, power and services recognize liabilities for the expected cost of retiring long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists. these aros are recorded at fair value in the period in which they are incurred and are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets. pse&g, as a rate-regulated entity, recognizes regulatory assets or liabilities as a result
table of contents of timing differences between the recording of costs and costs recovered through the rate-making process. we accrete the aro liability to reflect the passage of time.
assumptions and approach used: because quoted market prices are not available for aros, we estimate the initial fair value of an aro by calculating discounted cash flows that are dependent upon various assumptions, including:
•   amounts and timing of future cash expenditures associated with retirement, settlement or remediation activities,
•   if applicable, past experience with government regulators regarding similar obligations.
we obtain updated cost studies triennially unless new information necessitates more frequent updates. the most recent cost study was done in 2015. when we revise any assumptions used to calculate fair values of existing aros, we adjust the aro balance and corresponding long-lived asset which impacts the amount of accretion and depreciation expense recognized in future periods.
nuclear decommissioning aros aros related to the future decommissioning of power's nuclear facilities comprised 94% of power's total aros as of december 31, 2015. power determines its aros for its nuclear units by assigning probability weighting to various discounted cash flow outcomes for each of its nuclear units that incorporate the assumptions above as well as:
effect if different assumptions used: changes in the assumptions could result in a material change in the aro balance sheet obligation and the period over which we accrete to the ultimate liability. for example, a decrease of 1% in the discount rate would result in a $37 million increase in the nuclear aro as of december 31, 2015. an increase of 1% in the inflation rate would result in a $191 million increase in the nuclear aro as of december 31, 2015. also, if we did not assume that we would recover from the federal government the costs incurred for spent nuclear fuel, the nuclear aro would increase by $267 million at december 31, 2015.
accounting for regulated businesses pse&g prepares its financial statements to comply with gaap for rate-regulated enterprises, which differs in some respects from accounting for non-regulated businesses. in general, accounting for rate-regulated enterprises should reflect the economic effects of regulation. as a result, a regulated utility is required to defer the recognition of costs (regulatory asset) or recognize obligations (regulatory liability) if the rates established are designed to recover the costs and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged or collected. this accounting results in the recognition of revenues and expenses in different time periods than that of enterprises that are not regulated.
assumptions and approach used: pse&g recognizes regulatory assets where it is probable that such costs will be recoverable in future rates from customers and regulatory liabilities where it is probable that refunds will be made to customers in future billings. the highest degree of probability is an order from the bpu either approving recovery of the deferred costs over a future period or requiring the refund of a liability over a future period.
virtually all of pse&g's regulatory assets and liabilities are supported by bpu orders. in the absence of an order, pse&g will consider the following when determining whether to record a regulatory asset or liability:
•   past experience regarding similar items with the bpu,
•   treatment of a similar item in an order by the bpu for another utility,
•   recent discussions with the bpu.
all deferred costs are subject to prudence reviews by the bpu. when the recovery of a regulatory asset or payment of a regulatory liability is no longer probable, pse&g charges or credits earnings, as appropriate.
effect if different assumptions used: a change in the above assumptions may result in a material impact on our results of operations or our cash flows. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 5. regulatory assets and liabilities for a description of the amounts and nature of regulatory balance sheet amounts.

item 7.  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30, 2015 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30, 2015 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap).  the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.  these estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates.  we consider accounting estimates to be critical if both (i) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the companys financial condition.  our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets and income taxes.
management of the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the companys board of directors.
revenue recognition revenues from product sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of the risk of loss related to those goods.  in the americas region, sales are generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer and in the europe, the middle east & africa and asia/pacific regions, sales are generally recognized based upon the customers receipt.  in certain circumstances, transfer of title takes place at the point of sale, for example, at our retail stores.
revenues are reported on a net sales basis, which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual product returns received, discounts, incentive arrangements with retailers and an amount established for anticipated product returns.  our practice is to accept product returns from retailers only if properly requested and approved.  in accepting returns, we typically provide a credit to the retailer against accounts receivable from that retailer.  as a percentage of gross sales, returns were 3.4% in fiscal 2015 and 2014 and 3.3% in fiscal 2013.
our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales.  this accrual is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels.  consideration of these factors results in an accrual for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations.  experience has shown a relationship between retailer inventory levels and sales returns in the subsequent period, as well as a consistent pattern of returns due to the seasonal nature of our business.  in addition, as necessary, specific accruals may be established for significant future known or anticipated events.  the types of known or anticipated events that we have considered, and will continue to consider, include, but are not limited to, the financial condition of our customers, store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment and our decision to continue to support new and existing products.
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair-market value, with cost being based on standard cost and production variances, which approximate actual cost on the first-in, first-out method.  we believe this method most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale.  the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products, promotional products, raw materials and componentry and work in process that will be sold or used in future periods.  inventory cost includes raw materials, direct labor and overhead, as well as inbound freight.  manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity.  unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred.
we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value, based on various product sales projections.  this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age, historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales.  in addition, and as necessary, we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events.
pension and other post-retirement benefit costs we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees: a domestic trust-based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (u.s. qualified plan) and an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations (collectively with the u.s. qualified plan, the domestic plans); a domestic contributory defined contribution plan; international pension plans, which vary by country, consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans; deferred compensation arrangements; and certain other post-retirement benefit plans.
the amounts needed to fund future payouts under our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans are subject to numerous assumptions such as an anticipated discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, mortality rates and future compensation levels.  we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and post-retirement obligations.  while we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges, an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings.
the discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds.  for fiscal 2015, net periodic benefit cost was determined using discount rates for our domestic plans of 3.60% and 4.30% and varying rates on our international plans between .50% and 6.75%.  the discount rates for our domestic plans were based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.  we used an above-mean yield curve which represents an estimate of the effective settlement rate of the obligation, and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our domestic plans.  for our international plans, the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country, with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan.
for fiscal 2015, we used an expected return on plan assets of 7.50% for our u.s. qualified plan and varying rates of between 2.00% and 6.75% for our international plans.  in determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, we consider the historical rates of return, the nature of the plans investments and an expectation for the plans investment strategies.  see item 8.  financial statements and supplementary data  note 13  pension, deferred compensation and post-retirement benefit plans for details regarding the nature of our pension and post-retirement plan investments.  the difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  those gains/losses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods.  for fiscal 2015, our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately $61 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately $72 million.  the resulting net deferred loss of approximately $11 million, when combined with gains and losses from previous years, will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 7 to 18 years.  the actual return on plan assets from our global pension plans was lower than expected, primarily due to underperformance of u.s. plan assets partially offset by stronger than expected returns on international plan assets.
a 25 basis-point change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2015 pension expense:
expected return on assets   $(2.8               )                $2.8
our post-retirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates, which may have a significant effect on the amounts reported.  a one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates for fiscal 2015 would have had the following effects:
effect on total service and interest costs                         $1.3   $(1.0                     )
effect on post-retirement benefit obligations                     $15.1   $(10.1                    )
to determine the fiscal 2016 net periodic benefit cost, we are using discount rates of 4.40% and 3.70% for the u.s. qualified plan and the non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan, respectively, and varying rates for our international plans of between .75% and 7.00%.  we are using an expected return on plan assets of 7.00% for the u.s. qualified plan and varying rates for our international pension plans of between 2.00% and 7.00%.  the net change in these two key assumptions from those used in fiscal 2015 will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately $11 million in fiscal 2016.
goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.  other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.  goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
we assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.  we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments.  we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each operating segment regularly reviews the operating results of those components.  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for our reporting units.  when testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test.  if necessary, the quantitative impairment test is performed in two steps: (i) we determine if an indication of impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, and (ii) if there is an impairment, we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.  when testing other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we also have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative test.  the quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value.  if the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded.
for fiscal 2015, we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for all of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.  this qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value.  we considered macroeconomic factors including the global economic growth, general macroeconomic trends for the markets in which the reporting units operate and the intangible assets are employed, and the growth of the global prestige beauty industry.  in addition to these macroeconomic factors, among other things, we considered the reporting units current results and forecasts, any changes in the nature of the business, any significant legal, regulatory, contractual, political or other business climate factors, changes in the industry/competitive environment, changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets and our intention to sell or dispose of a reporting unit or cease the use of a trademark.  with regard to our fiscal 2015 acquisitions of rodin olio lusso, le labo, editions de parfums frédéric malle and glamglow, the carrying values of the related goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of the assessment date approximated their fair values. as a result of our qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired and we did not need to perform a quantitative assessment.
for fiscal 2014, we tested our reporting units for impairment using the two-step approach and our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing their fair values to their carrying values. as a result of these tests, we concluded the fair values of our reporting units and the fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets substantially exceeded their carrying values.
we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  when such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value.  if the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, which is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows.
income taxes we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns.  as of june 30, 2015, we have current net deferred tax assets of $279.0 million and non-current net deferred tax assets of $72.1 million.  the net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates.  included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of $120.9 million for deferred tax assets, where management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction.  based on our assessments, no additional valuation allowance is required.  if our assessment of realizability of a deferred tax asset changes, an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time.
we provide tax reserves for u.s. federal, state, local and foreign exposures relating to periods subject to audit.  the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.  we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon managements evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.  for those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.  for those tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.  we classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes.  although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in managements opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.  if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations.
quantitative analysis during the three-year period ended june 30, 2015, there have not been material changes in the assumptions underlying these critical accounting policies, nor to the related significant estimates.  the results of our business underlying these assumptions have not differed significantly from our expectations.
while we believe that the estimates that we have made are proper and the related results of operations for the period are presented fairly in all material respects, other assumptions could reasonably be justified that would change the amount of reported net sales, cost of sales or our provision for income taxes as they relate to the provisions for anticipated sales returns, inventory obsolescence reserve and income taxes.  for fiscal 2015, had these estimates been changed simultaneously by 2.5% in either direction, our reported gross profit would have increased or decreased by approximately $5.9 million and the provision for income taxes would have increased or decreased by approximately $0.2 million.  the collective impact of these changes on operating income, net earnings attributable to the estée lauder companies inc., and net earnings attributable to the estée lauder companies inc. per diluted common share would be an increase or decrease of approximately $5.9 million, $5.7 million and $.01, respectively.
results of operations we manufacture, market and sell beauty products including those in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care categories which are distributed in over 150 countries and territories.  the following table is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 and reflects the basis of presentation described in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 2  summary of significant accounting policies and note 20  segment data and related information for all periods presented.  products and services that do not meet our definition of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care have been included in the other category.

in order to meet the demands of consumers, we continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives.  the economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period.  the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning.
we operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the united states.  accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations.  therefore, we present certain net sales, operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the united states.  constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period.  we calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weighted-average foreign currency exchange rates.
overview we believe the best way to continue to increase stockholder value is to provide our customers and consumers with superior products and services that they have come to expect from us in the most efficient and profitable manner while recognizing consumers changing behaviors and shopping preferences.  to be the global leader in prestige beauty, we are guided by our long-term strategy through fiscal 2018, which has numerous initiatives across geographic regions, product categories, brands, channels of distribution and functions that are designed to grow our sales, leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable.  we also plan to continue to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship in high quality products and services and engaging communications.
we believe our diverse and highly desirable brand portfolio positions us well to capitalize on opportunities in fast growing and profitable areas in prestige beauty. skin care, our most profitable product category, remains a strategic priority for us and, as a result, we continue to support our large, long-standing skin care product lines including advanced night repair from estée lauder, cliniques 3-step skin care system and crème de la mer from la mer.  we are also developing and introducing new products, such as new dimension from estée lauder, the clinique sonic system purifying cleansing brush and clinique smart custom-repair serum, as well as skin care masks from la mer.  we also supplemented our skin care offerings in fiscal 2015 through the recent acquisitions of glamglow and rodin olio lusso. while global prestige skin care growth was slower in fiscal 2015, global growth in prestige makeup accelerated, in part due to social media activities.  this benefited our makeup sales, and we continue to believe that the makeup category represents one of our most compelling growth opportunities. during the year, we successfully launched a number of new products, including new collections from our makeup artist brands, pure color envy sculpting lipstick and sculpting eye shadow palette from estée lauder, and pop lip colour and primer, beyond perfecting foundation and concealer and chubby stick sculpting products from clinique.  our fragrance category has benefited from new launches, expanded distribution from our luxury fragrance brands and our recent acquisitions of le labo and editions de parfums frédéric malle.  in addition, we are expanding our hair care brands in salons and other retail channels.  to complement the strategies in our existing business, we are continuously looking to acquire and incubate smaller brands that we believe have growth potential and may provide unique opportunities for profitable growth in the future.
our global footprint provides us many avenues of growth, enabling us to quickly utilize our strengths to capture opportunities around the world by leveraging our regional organization and to align the talents and expertise of our people in an effort to assure that we are locally relevant with our products, services, channels, marketing and visual merchandising.  we are seeking share growth in large, image-building cities within core markets such as the united states, the united kingdom, france, italy and japan by strengthening our geographic presence there.  in addition, we continue to expand our presence and accelerate growth in emerging markets such as china, the middle east, eastern europe, brazil, russia and south africa.  during fiscal 2015, we have seen a general slowdown in department store traffic in some markets, which has particularly affected estée lauder and clinique, but we have been able to grow our business in other channels.  in north america, we continued to expand our presence in specialty multi-brand retailers and freestanding retail stores.  internationally, we expanded our business in freestanding stores, in european perfumeries and pharmacies, and in department stores, particularly in the united kingdom and certain markets in asia.  travel retail remains an important source of sales growth, profitability and brand building, although it is susceptible to a number of external factors, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and consumers willingness and ability to travel.  we have strategies focused on consumers who purchase in this channel, in stores at their travel destinations or when they return to their home market.  in addition, we have identified opportunities to expand our online portfolio around the world, resulting in strong net sales growth in this channel, and we are in the early stages of developing and testing omnichannel concepts to better serve consumers as they shop across channels.  we are applying what we have learned from our digital strategy in the united states to other markets such as brazil and russia. to further drive our online sales, we are expanding our presence on key third-party platforms in china, where we are seeing promising results.
while our business is performing well overall, we continue to see competitive pressures and economic challenges in certain countries around the world.  we remain cautious of slower retail growth in hong kong and china, a decline in spending by russian and brazilian travelers, unfavorable foreign exchange due to the strength of the u.s. dollar in relation to most currencies, and lower net sales from our travel retail business in korea, one of our largest markets for travel retail, due to a decrease in the number of travelers there as a result of the recent outbreak of the mers virus.  additionally, we are monitoring the effects of economic instability in russia, greece and brazil.
we believe we can, to some extent, offset the impact of these challenges by accelerating areas where we see more strength by utilizing the various growth drivers among our brands, channels and markets.  however, if economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen, or the adverse conditions previously discussed are further prolonged, then we expect there could be a negative effect on ongoing consumer confidence, demand and spending and, as a result, our business.  we will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business.
looking ahead to fiscal 2016, we plan to execute our strategy by focusing on the multiple growth engines that we believe will promote long-term sustainable growth.  these include strengthening our presence in emerging markets, continuing to revitalize and accelerate growth in our heritage brands, focusing on key demographics and seeking opportunities to add to our diverse brand portfolio.  we will continue to drive innovation and creativity that we believe will enable us to introduce products that resonate with consumers.  some will involve new sub-categories and others may expand key franchises.  we expect to leverage our topline growth through greater productivity, due in part to cost savings and efficiencies from our strategic modernization initiative (smi).  we plan to continue allocating our resources to growth drivers such as digital capabilities, including the development of omnichannel concepts, retail store expansion and information technology enhancements.  we also plan to continue to succeed in high growth product categories, sub-categories and channels of distribution, benefit from regional opportunities, focus on emerging market and luxury consumers and enhance our local relevance.
investment in our global information systems is ongoing.  we have implemented initiatives to leverage our smi foundation that are focused on sustainment and global efficiencies.  as we continue to modernize our key processes, related systems and infrastructure, we are also developing upgraded capabilities to support our human resource operations and are making investments to upgrade our global technology infrastructure, as well as our retail systems and retail capabilities globally.  these initiatives are expected to improve profitability by enhancing gross margin and supporting efficiencies in select operating expenses and working capital, freeing resources to strategically reinvest in activities to support our future growth.
we rolled out the last major wave of smi in july 2014 and currently most of our locations are sap-enabled.  we plan to continue the implementation of sap at our remaining locations throughout the next few fiscal years.  in connection with the july 2014 implementation, some retailers accelerated their sales orders that would have occurred in our fiscal 2015 first quarter into our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter in advance of this implementation to provide adequate safety stock to mitigate any potential short-term business interruption associated with the smi rollout.  the impact on net sales and operating results by product category and geographic region was as follows:
the higher orders at the end of fiscal 2014, coupled with the resulting lower orders in the beginning of fiscal 2015 created a difficult comparison between fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, which resulted in a variance of approximately $357 million in net sales and approximately $254 million in operating results and adversely impacted our operating margin comparisons.  while these additional orders had an adverse impact on our fiscal 2015 net sales and operating results comparisons, we expect there to be corresponding favorable comparisons on our first quarter and full year fiscal 2016 net sales and operating results.  we believe the presentation of certain year-to-date comparative information in the following discussions that excludes the impact of the timing of these orders is useful in analyzing the net sales performance and operating results of our business.
see non-gaap financial measures below for reconciliations between non-gaap financial measures and the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures.
fiscal 2015 as compared with fiscal 2014
net sales net sales decreased 2%, or $188.4 million, to $10,780.4 million, entirely driven by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $519 million and the difficult comparison due to the accelerated orders, as discussed above, of approximately $357 million.  inclusive of these items, higher net sales in our makeup and hair care product categories were more than offset by declines in our skin care and fragrance product categories, while geographically, we experienced lower net sales in each region.  our makeup artist and luxury brands continued to grow net sales through successful product launches and expanded global distribution.  however, net sales from estée lauder and clinique have been challenged in all of our product categories and reflect a difficult comparison to the prior year, which featured significant launch activity related to the reformulation of certain iconic skin care products and several significant fragrance launches. in addition, we are experiencing strong growth in certain channels such as specialty-multi, online and freestanding stores, as well as expansion in emerging markets.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders, net sales would have increased 6%, with growth in each of our major product categories and within each geographic region.
product categories the change in net sales in each product category was negatively impacted by the accelerated orders into the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter from certain of our retailers due to our implementation of smi as follows: skin care, approximately $183 million; makeup, approximately $131 million; fragrance, approximately $42 million; and hair care, approximately $1 million.
skin care net sales of skin care products decreased 6%, or $291.1 million, to $4,478.7 million. this decrease reflected the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $215 million. the decrease, as reported, reflected lower net sales of estée lauder and clinique products of approximately $303 million, combined, primarily due to the accelerated orders and significant launch activity in the prior year related to the reformulation of certain iconic products.  these decreases were partially offset by higher sales of la mer products, primarily due to new launches and expanded distribution in the travel retail channel, and incremental sales from our recent acquisitions of approximately $23 million, combined.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders, skin care net sales would have increased 2%.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net sales decreased 2%.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in skin care would have decreased 2%.
makeup makeup net sales increased 2%, or $94.4 million, to $4,304.6 million. this change reflected the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $205 million.  the net sales increase, as reported, primarily reflected higher net sales from our makeup artist brands, tom ford and smashbox of approximately $293 million, combined.  sales from our makeup artist brands benefited from new product offerings, as well as expanded distribution in a number of channels, including our freestanding retail stores.  the higher net sales from tom ford and smashbox were primarily due to expanded distribution of tom ford in the travel retail channel and smashbox in specialty multi-brand retailers.  partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of clinique and estée lauder products of approximately $161 million, combined.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders, makeup net sales would have increased 10%.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, makeup net sales increased 7%.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in makeup would have increased 5%.
fragrance net sales of fragrance products decreased 1%, or $8.6 million, to $1,416.4 million.  this decrease was entirely driven by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $75 million.  the decrease, as reported, primarily reflected lower sales of certain estée lauder, clinique, coach and tommy hilfiger fragrances of approximately $98 million, combined.  these decreases were mostly offset by the strong performance of luxury fragrances from jo malone london and tom ford that resulted in higher net sales of approximately $91 million, combined.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders, fragrance net sales would have increased 8%.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fragrance net sales increased 5%.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in fragrance would have increased 2%.
hair care hair care net sales increased 3%, or $15.0 million, to $530.6 million. this change reflected the negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately $22 million.  the increase in net sales reflected expanded global distribution of aveda products in department stores, freestanding retail stores, salons and in the travel retail channel, and bumble and bumble products in specialty multi-brand retailers.  the category also benefited from increased sales of smooth infusion naturally straight from aveda, as well as the expansion of the hairdressers invisible oil line of products from bumble and bumble which contributed approximately $12 million to the increase, combined.  partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of the invati line of products and dry remedy shampoo from aveda of approximately $6 million, combined.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders, hair care net sales would have increased 7%.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, hair care net sales increased 7%.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in hair care would have increased 3%.
geographic regions the overall change in net sales in each geographic region was negatively impacted by the accelerated orders into the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter from certain of our retailers due to our implementation of smi as follows: americas, approximately $169 million; europe, the middle east & africa, approximately $136 million; and asia/pacific, approximately $52 million.
net sales in the americas decreased 1%, or $58.5 million, to $4,513.8 million.  net sales in the united states and canada, as reported, decreased approximately $53 million, combined, primarily due to lower net sales from certain of our heritage brands, driven by the impact of the accelerated orders and a difficult comparison with the prior year, which featured significant launch activity related to the reformulation of certain iconic products.  these decreases were partially offset by higher net sales from our makeup artist, luxury and hair care brands.  net sales in latin america decreased approximately $5 million, primarily reflecting lower net sales in venezuela, partially offset by higher net sales in brazil.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders, net sales in the americas would have increased 6%.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in the americas increased 2%.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in the americas would have increased 2%.
in europe, the middle east & africa, net sales decreased 2%, or $77.3 million, to $4,086.4 million, driven by approximately $285 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation due to the strength of the u.s. dollar in relation to most currencies in the region.  lower sales in our travel retail business, germany, iberia and italy totaled approximately $185 million, combined. the lower sales in our travel retail business were driven by the impact of the accelerated orders.  excluding this impact, travel retail net sales increased due to a strategic expansion of certain of our luxury brands and our makeup artist brands, partially offset by the negative impact of the social instability in hong kong, as well as changes in the purchasing power of key groups of travelers.  the decrease in sales in germany, iberia and italy was due to the weakening of the euro against the u.s. dollar.  excluding this impact, net sales in germany, iberia and italy increased, primarily driven by certain of our luxury, makeup artist and hair care brands as a result of expanded distribution and new product introductions.  partially offsetting these reported decreases were higher sales in the united kingdom and the middle east of approximately $122 million, combined.  the increase in sales in the united kingdom was primarily driven by our makeup artist and luxury brands.  higher sales in the middle east were primarily driven by certain of our luxury brands and makeup artist brands as a result of new product introductions and expanded distribution.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders, net sales in europe, the middle east & africa would have increased 8%.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, europe, the middle east & africa net sales increased 5%.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in europe, the middle east & africa would have increased 1%.
net sales in asia/pacific decreased 2%, or $52.5 million, to $2,180.2 million, driven by approximately $79 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation due to the strength of the u.s. dollar in relation to certain currencies in the region. lower sales in japan and hong kong totaled approximately $94 million, combined.  the decrease in net sales in japan primarily reflected the impact of the accelerated orders and foreign currency translation, partially offset by higher sales of certain of our luxury and makeup artist brands.  the lower sales in hong kong were primarily due to the negative impact to our business as a result of the social instability there.  these decreases were partially offset by higher net sales in china, australia and korea of approximately $46 million, combined.  the higher net sales in china were primarily driven by certain of our heritage and luxury brands, and our makeup artist brands as a result of expanded distribution in department stores, freestanding stores and online.  for australia and korea, the higher net sales were from certain of our makeup artist and luxury brands.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the accelerated orders, net sales in asia/pacific would have increased 4%.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, asia/pacific net sales increased 1%.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in asia/pacific would have been flat.
we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth.
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 19.5% as compared with 19.7% in the prior year.  this improvement reflected favorable changes in foreign exchange transactions of approximately 20 basis points, partially offset by an increase in obsolescence charges of approximately 10 basis points.
since certain promotional activities are a component of sales or cost of sales, and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage.  in addition, future cost of sales may be impacted by channels of distribution and their relative growth.
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 65.6% as compared with 63.6% in the prior year, and were impacted by the accelerated orders and brand and channel mix as certain retail and media formats carry different cost structures.  as a percentage of net sales, this increase primarily reflected an increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately 100 basis points as a result of higher support spending behind capability-building initiatives, such as information technology, as well as for acquisition-related expenses.  this increase also reflected higher store operating and selling costs of approximately 110 basis points, combined, primarily driven by the expansion of m·a·c and jo malone london freestanding retail stores.  also contributing to this increase were higher costs associated with stock-based compensation and higher spending on advertising, merchandising and sampling as a percentage of net sales of approximately 10 basis points, each. partially offsetting these increases were lower charges related to the measurement of net monetary assets in venezuela of approximately 30 basis points and favorable changes in foreign exchange transactions of approximately 10 basis points.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders into the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales would have increased approximately 10 basis points, primarily reflecting an increase in general and administrative expenses and higher store operating costs, partially offset by lower spending on advertising, merchandising and sampling and lower charges related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela.
changes in advertising, merchandising and sampling spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets and brands being emphasized.
operating results operating income decreased 12%, or $221.3 million, to $1,606.3 million, driven entirely by the negative impact of the accelerated orders of approximately $254 million and foreign currency translation of approximately $131 million.  operating margin decreased to 14.9% of net sales as compared with 16.7% in the prior year, reflecting an increase in our operating expense margin, partially offset by our higher gross margin.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, operating income would have increased 2% and operating margin would have remained flat.
our skin care, makeup and fragrance results declined, primarily reflecting the accelerated orders, as well as certain challenges and difficult comparisons affecting our net sales growth in certain markets and channels by our heritage brands as previously discussed.  these decreases were partially offset by improved results from our makeup artist, certain luxury, and our hair care brands.  while certain operating expenses have increased as a percentage of net sales during the current year, we have been able to implement cost containment measures to mitigate the impact.
product categories the overall change in operating results in each product category was negatively impacted by the accelerated orders into the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter from certain of our retailers due to our implementation of smi as follows: skin care, approximately $144 million; makeup, approximately $82 million; fragrance, approximately $28 million; and the impact on hair care was de minimis.
skin care operating income decreased 15%, or $143.6 million, to $832.2 million, reflecting the impact of the accelerated orders and a difficult comparison to the significant launch activity in the prior year by certain of our heritage brands.  makeup operating income decreased 8%, or $56.6 million, to $659.3 million, primarily due to lower results from our heritage brands, reflecting the impact of the accelerated orders, partially offset by improved results from our makeup artist brands.  fragrance operating income decreased 20%, or $21.3 million, to $82.8 million, reflecting the lower launch activity from certain designer fragrances and heritage brands, partially offset by higher results from certain of our luxury fragrance brands.  hair care operating results increased 12%, or $4.2 million, to $37.9 million, primarily reflecting higher net sales driven by expanded global distribution and new product launches, as well as lower investment spending as compared with the higher level of spending in the prior year to support the invati line of products.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, skin care operating results would have been flat and makeup, fragrance and hair care operating results would have increased 4%, 7% and 13%, respectively.
geographic regions the overall change in operating results in each geographic region was negatively impacted by the accelerated orders into the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter from certain of our retailers due to our implementation of smi as follows: americas, approximately $106 million; europe, the middle east & africa, approximately $106 million; and asia/pacific, approximately $42 million.
operating income in the americas decreased 44%, or $235.0 million, to $302.3 million, primarily reflecting the decrease in net sales from our heritage brands in the united states and canada associated with the accelerated orders and the significant launch activity in the prior year related to the reformulation of certain iconic products, as well as higher general and administrative expenses, which include acquisition-related expenses.  this decrease was partially offset by lower advertising, merchandising and sampling spending by our heritage brands due to the lower launch activity and a reallocation of spending among media formats.  the region also benefited from higher results in latin america, primarily driven by lower charges related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela. adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, operating income in the americas would have decreased 27%.
in europe, the middle east & africa, operating income increased less than 1%, or $5.0 million, to $943.3 million. higher operating results in the united kingdom, the middle east, france, india, russia and switzerland of approximately $83 million, combined, were partially offset by lower operating results in our travel retail business, due to the accelerated orders, and, to a lesser extent, germany of approximately $79 million, combined.  the higher results in france, india, russia and switzerland were primarily due to an increase in constant currency net sales. adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, operating income in europe, the middle east & africa would have increased 13%.
in asia/pacific, operating income increased 3%, or $11.6 million, to $360.7 million.  higher results in china, korea and australia totaled approximately $49 million, combined.  these higher results were partially offset by lower results in japan, due to the accelerated orders, and singapore of approximately $40 million, combined.  the lower results in singapore were primarily due to lower net sales.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, operating income in asia/pacific would have increased 16%.
interest expense interest expense increased to $60.0 million as compared with $59.4 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher short- and long- term debt levels.
interest income and investment income, net interest income and investment income, net increased to $14.3 million as compared with $8.6 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher investment income as a result of an increase in short- and long-term investment balances and rates in connection with our modified cash investment strategy, as well as realized gains on investments.  see financial condition below for further discussion of our modified cash investment strategy.
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents u.s. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.  the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.  our effective tax rate will change from quarter to quarter based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stock-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies.  in addition, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of change.
the effective rate for income taxes was 29.9% and 32.0% for fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.  the decrease of 210 basis points was principally attributable to a lower effective tax rate related to our foreign operations, which included venezuela remeasurement charges in fiscal 2015 and 2014 of $5.3 million and $38.3 million, respectively, for which no tax benefit was provided. this reduction was partially offset by an increase in income tax reserve adjustments recorded in the current year.
net earnings attributable to the estée lauder companies inc. as compared with the prior year decreased 10%, or $115.2 million, to $1,088.9 million and diluted net earnings per common share decreased 8% from $3.06 to $2.82.
non-gaap financial measures we use certain non-gaap financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business.  management believes that excluding these items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between two periods.  while we consider the non-gaap measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap.  the following tables present net sales, operating income and diluted net earnings per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of accelerated orders associated with the july 2014 smi rollout, adjustments associated with restructuring activities and the venezuela remeasurement charges.  the tables provide reconciliations between these non-gaap financial measures and the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures.

fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013
net sales net sales increased 8%, or $787.1 million, to $10,968.8 million, primarily reflecting growth in all of our product categories and geographic regions.  the impact of foreign currency translation on the change in net sales was de minimis.
in advance of our july 2014 implementation of smi at certain of our locations and to provide adequate safety stock to mitigate any potential short-term business interruption associated with the rollout, certain of our retailers accelerated their orders during the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter.  those additional orders, which totaled approximately $178 million, would have occurred in our fiscal 2015 first quarter and created a favorable comparison to fiscal 2013. adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales would have increased 6%, with growth in all of our product categories and geographic regions.
product categories the change in net sales in each product category benefited from the accelerated orders during fiscal 2014, as discussed above, as follows: skin care, approximately $91 million; makeup, approximately $65 million; fragrance, approximately $21 million; and hair care, approximately $1 million.
skin care net sales of skin care products increased 7%, or $304.5 million, to $4,769.8 million.  the fiscal 2014 launches of advanced night repair synchronized recovery complex ii and micro essence skin activating treatment lotion from estée lauder, and dramatically different moisturizing lotion + and reformulated repairwear laser focus from clinique contributed approximately $615 million of incremental sales, combined.  also contributing to the increase were higher sales of la mer products and the nutritious line of products from estée lauder of approximately $144 million, combined.  partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of certain existing advanced night repair synchronized recovery products from estée lauder and dramatically different moisturizing lotion and repairwear laser focus from clinique of approximately $493 million, combined.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, skin care net sales increased 8%.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in skin care would have increased 5%.
makeup makeup net sales increased 9%, or $333.3 million, to $4,210.2 million, primarily reflecting higher net sales from our makeup artist brands, the fiscal 2014 launch of all about shadow from clinique and higher sales of smashbox products of approximately $339 million, combined.  sales from our makeup artist brands benefited from new product offerings, as well as expanded distribution in line with our retail store strategy.  partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of chubby stick moisturizing lip colour balm and high impact lip color from clinique, as well as the fiscal 2013 launches of pore refining solutions makeup from clinique and pure color vivid shine lipstick from estée lauder of approximately $34 million, combined.  the impact of foreign currency translation on makeup net sales was de minimis.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in makeup would have increased 7%.
fragrance net sales of fragrance products increased 9%, or $114.2 million, to $1,425.0 million, primarily reflecting the fiscal 2014 launches of estée lauder modern muse, the michael kors collection, jo malone peony & blush suede and tory burch, as well as higher sales of tom ford black orchid of approximately $149 million, combined.  these increases were partially offset by lower sales of estée lauder pleasures, donna karan cashmere mist, dkny be delicious so intense and coach poppy of approximately $31 million, combined. the impact of foreign currency translation on fragrance net sales was de minimis.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in fragrance would have increased 7%.
hair care hair care net sales increased 5%, or $26.7 million, to $515.6 million, reflecting the continued success and growth of the invati line of products and the new and reformulated dry remedy line of products from aveda, which contributed approximately $25 million, combined to the increase.  the category benefited from sales generated from expanded global distribution of aveda products to salons and in the travel retail channel and bumble and bumble products to specialty multi-brand retailers.  partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of ojon products.  the decrease in ojon net sales was primarily due to the exit of that business from the direct response television channel in our fiscal 2014 second quarter. excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, hair care net sales increased 6%.  the impact of the accelerated orders on the change in reported net sales in hair care was de minimis.
geographic regions the overall change in net sales in each geographic region benefited from the accelerated orders during fiscal 2014, as discussed above, as follows: americas, approximately $84 million; europe, the middle east & africa, approximately $68 million; and asia/pacific, approximately $26 million.
net sales in the americas increased 6%, or $269.4 million, to $4,572.3 million, primarily reflecting higher net sales in the united states of approximately $231 million, including the $84 million in accelerated orders.  this growth primarily reflected new collections from our makeup artist brands, higher sales of prestige products from our luxury brands, the continued expansion of smashbox at specialty multi-brand retailers and department stores, contributions from new product innovations from certain of our heritage brands, fiscal 2014 launches from certain of our designer fragrances and expansion into new retail channels by certain of our hair care brands.  net sales in latin america increased approximately $24 million, led by venezuela and brazil.  the net sales increase in venezuela was primarily due to price increases as a result of rising inflation.  net sales in canada increased approximately $15 million.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, the americas net sales increased 7%.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in the americas would have increased 4%.
in europe, the middle east & africa, net sales increased 11%, or $405.0 million, to $4,163.7 million, primarily reflecting higher sales from our travel retail business, the united kingdom, germany and france of approximately $335 million, combined.  the net sales increase in our travel retail business primarily reflected the success of fiscal 2014 launch initiatives, an increase in global airline passenger traffic and expanded distribution, as well as the impact of the accelerated orders.  this was despite a slowdown at retail, in part, due to an adverse impact of chinese government actions on the travel and spending of chinese consumers.  higher sales in the united kingdom and france were primarily driven by certain of our makeup artist and luxury brands.  the net sales increase in germany was primarily driven by our makeup artist and certain of our heritage brands.  these increases were partially offset by lower net sales in south africa and india of approximately $7 million, combined, driven by the weakening of their respective currencies.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, europe, the middle east & africa net sales increased 9%.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in europe, the middle east & africa would have increased 9%.
net sales in asia/pacific increased 5%, or $111.1 million, to $2,232.7 million, primarily reflecting higher sales in china and hong kong of approximately $119 million, combined.  higher sales in china were primarily driven by expanded distribution.  the net sales increase in hong kong was primarily due to higher net sales from certain of our heritage and luxury brands.  these increases were partially offset by lower net sales in japan and australia of approximately $17 million, combined.  the declines in japan and australia were driven by the weakening of their respective currencies, which more than offset an improvement in their local retail environments and the impact of the accelerated orders in japan. excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, asia/pacific net sales increased 9%.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, reported net sales in asia/pacific would have increased 4%.
we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market, which may account for differences in regional sales growth.
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales decreased to 19.7% as compared with 19.9% in fiscal 2013.  cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales reflected strategic changes in pricing and the mix of our business of approximately 30 basis points and favorable manufacturing variances of approximately 10 basis points.  partially offsetting these changes were an increase in obsolescence charges and the unfavorable effect of exchange rates of approximately 10 basis points, each.
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 63.6% as compared with 65.1% in fiscal 2013.  as a percentage of net sales, this decrease primarily reflected lower spending on advertising, merchandising and sampling of approximately 110 basis points, lower selling costs of approximately 50 basis points and a favorable comparison to fiscal 2013, which reflected restructuring, goodwill and other impairment charges of approximately 40 basis points, combined.  these improvements were partially offset by a charge in fiscal 2014 to remeasure net monetary assets in venezuela of approximately 30 basis points and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange transactions of approximately 10 basis points.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders in fiscal 2014, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales would have decreased 50 basis points, primarily reflecting lower spending on advertising, merchandising and sampling, and lower selling costs.
changes in advertising, merchandising and sampling spending result from the type, timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts, as well as the markets and brands being emphasized.
operating results operating income increased 20%, or $301.6 million, to $1,827.6 million and operating margin increased to 16.7% of net sales as compared with 15.0% in fiscal 2013, which primarily reflected our lower operating expense margin and, to a lesser extent, our higher gross margin.  the overall operating results were also impacted by approximately $127 million related to the accelerated orders in fiscal 2014, as discussed above, which created a favorable comparison to fiscal 2013, partially offset by the fiscal 2014 remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela of $38.3 million.  the following discussions of operating results by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of total charges (adjustments) associated with restructuring activities of $(2.9) million, or less than 1% of net sales, for fiscal 2014 and $17.8 million, or less than 1% of net sales, for fiscal 2013.  we believe the following analysis of operating results better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders in fiscal 2014 and charges (adjustments) associated with restructuring activities, operating income would have increased 10% and operating margin would have increased 50 basis points.
product categories the overall change in operating results in each product category benefited from the accelerated orders during fiscal 2014, as discussed above, as follows: skin care, approximately $72 million; makeup, approximately $41 million; fragrance, approximately $14 million; and the impact on hair care was de minimis.
skin care operating income increased 18%, or $145.7 million, to $975.8 million, primarily reflecting higher results driven by fiscal 2014 product launches from estée lauder and clinique and higher sales of luxury skin care products.  makeup operating income increased 23%, or $135.5 million, to $715.9 million, primarily reflecting improved results from our makeup artist brands and certain of our heritage brands, attributable to growth in net sales.  we reallocated our investment spending among brands and media formats which positively impacted operating income in the skin care and makeup product categories.  fragrance operating income decreased 13%, or $16.2 million, to $104.1 million, primarily reflecting higher investment spending behind fiscal 2014 major launches, partially offset by higher results from our luxury brands.  the fiscal 2014 remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela impacted the skin care, makeup and fragrance product categories by $12 million, $16 million and $10 million, respectively.  hair care operating results increased 26%, or $7.0 million, to $33.7 million, primarily reflecting higher results from aveda and strategic reductions in spending behind ojon products.  adjusting for the accelerated orders, operating income in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care product categories would have increased (decreased) 9%, 16%, (25%) and 26%, respectively.
geographic regions the overall change in operating results in each geographic region benefited as a result of the accelerated orders during fiscal 2014, as discussed above, as follows: americas, approximately $53 million; europe, the middle east & africa, approximately $53 million; and asia/pacific, approximately $21 million.
operating income in the americas increased 27%, or $114.1 million, to $537.3 million, primarily reflecting the increase in net sales, as previously discussed, as well as a more measured approach to spending.  these improvements were partially offset by the fiscal 2014 remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, operating income in the americas would have increased 14%.
in europe, the middle east & africa, operating income increased 15%, or $124.9 million, to $938.3 million.  higher results from our travel retail business and in the united kingdom totaled approximately $126 million, combined, primarily reflecting higher sales.  the higher results in our travel retail business also reflected the impact of the accelerated orders.  these improvements were partially offset by lower operating results in france and the middle east of approximately $10 million, combined.  the lower results in france were due to higher spending on advertising, merchandising and sampling.  adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, operating income in europe, the middle east & africa would have increased 9%.
in asia/pacific, operating income increased 14%, or $41.9 million, to $349.1 million.  higher results in korea, japan and hong kong totaled approximately $45 million, combined. the higher results in korea were due to lower spending on advertising, merchandising and sampling and the higher results in japan primarily reflected the impact of the accelerated orders.  the higher results in the region were partially offset by lower operating results of approximately $11 million in china and thailand, combined. the lower results from china were primarily driven by an increase in investment spending as a result of new product introductions and increased distribution. adjusting for the impact of the accelerated orders, operating income in asia/pacific would have increased 7%.
interest expense interest expense decreased to $59.4 million as compared with $63.1 million in fiscal 2013, primarily due to the refinancing of debt at lower rates in fiscal 2013.
interest expense on debt extinguishment during the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we redeemed the $230.1 million principal amount of our 7.75% senior notes due 2013 at a price of 108% of the principal amount.  we recorded a pre-tax expense on the extinguishment of debt of $19.1 million representing the call premium of $18.6 million and the pro-rata write-off of $0.5 million of issuance costs and debt discount.
interest income and investment income, net interest income and investment income, net increased to $8.6 million, which remained relatively unchanged compared with $8.3 million in fiscal 2013.
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents u.s. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.  the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.  our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stock-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies.  in addition, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the period of change.
the effective rate for income taxes was 32.0% and 30.6% for fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase in the rate of 140 basis points was principally attributable to a higher effective tax rate related to the companys foreign operations, which included the impact of the venezuela remeasurement charge for which no tax benefit has been provided, as well as slightly higher favorable income tax reserve adjustments recorded in fiscal 2013.
net earnings attributable to the estée lauder companies inc. as compared with fiscal 2013 increased 18%, or $184.3 million, to $1,204.1 million and diluted net earnings per common share increased 19% from $2.58 to $3.06.
non-gaap financial measures we use certain non-gaap financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business.  management believes that excluding these items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between two periods.  while we consider the non-gaap measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap.  the following tables present net sales, operating income and diluted net earnings per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of accelerated orders associated with the july 2014 smi rollout, the venezuela fiscal 2014 remeasurement charge, returns and charges (adjustments) associated with restructuring activities and the fiscal 2013 interest expense on debt extinguishment.  the tables provide reconciliations between these non-gaap financial measures and the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures.

financial condition liquidity and capital resources overview our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad.  at june 30, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,021.4 million compared with $1,629.1 million at june 30, 2014.  our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions.  to mitigate the risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure.
the decline in cash balances reflects the change in our cash investment strategy that we implemented in the fiscal 2015 second quarter, to invest a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in short- and long-term investments.  our investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, asset diversification, and achieving appropriate returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy.  these investments are classified as available-for-sale and totaled $917.8 million at june 30, 2015.
during fiscal 2015, we acquired rodin olio lusso, a skin care brand, le labo, a fragrance brand, editions de parfums frédéric malle, a fragrance brand, and glamglow, a skin care brand.  the purchase price related to each of these acquisitions includes cash paid at closing plus additional amounts to be paid in the future, a portion of which is contingent on the achievement of certain future operating results. the amounts paid at closing, amounting to $237.2 million, were funded by cash on hand and through the issuance of commercial paper.  the additional amounts are expected to be paid from fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2020 with the exception of working capital adjustments that were paid during fiscal 2015 and additional working capital adjustments and a purchase price true-up payment that are expected to be paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.  the aggregate acquisition-date fair value of these transactions was approximately $437 million.
our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary.  from time to time, we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding.  to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper, issue long-term debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities.
based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations, information systems enhancements, capital expenditures, potential stock repurchases, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis. our cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investment balances at june 30, 2015 include approximately $1,694 million of cash and short- and long-term investments in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy.  we do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds offshore impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations.  if these indefinitely reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends, we would be subject to additional taxes.
credit ratings changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs.  our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility as discussed below.  downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing.  a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  as of august 14, 2015, our commercial paper is rated a-1 by standard & poors and p-1 by moodys and our long-term debt is rated a+ with a stable outlook by standard & poors and a2 with a stable outlook by moodys.
(5)     consists of $250.0 million principal, unamortized debt discount of $0.2 million and a $(0.2) million adjustment to reflect the fair value of interest rate swaps.
(6)     consists of $300.0 million principal, unamortized debt discount of $0.1 million and a $14.0 million adjustment to reflect the termination value of interest rate swaps.
(7)     the senior notes contain certain customary incurrencebased covenants, including limitations on indebtedness secured by liens.
in june 2015, we issued the 2045 senior notes in a public offering, priced at 97.999% with a yield of 4.497%.  interest payments are required to be made semi-annually on june 15th and december 15th.  for further information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 10  debt.
we have a $1.0 billion commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the united states.  as of june 30, 2015, we had no commercial paper outstanding.  at august 14, 2015, we had $220.0 million of commercial paper outstanding, which we may refinance on a periodic basis as it matures at then-prevailing market interest rates.
we have a $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the facility) that we extended by one year and is currently set to expire on july 15, 2020.  we have a remaining option to extend the facility one more year.  at june 30, 2015, no borrowings were outstanding under the facility.  the facility may be used for general corporate purposes.  up to the equivalent of $350 million of the facility is available for multi-currency loans.  the interest rate on borrowings under the facility is based on libor or on the higher of prime, which is the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent, or 1⁄2% plus the federal funds rate.  we incurred costs of approximately $1.0 million to establish the facility, which costs are being amortized over the term of the facility.  the facility has an annual fee of $0.6 million, payable quarterly, based on our current credit ratings.  the facility also contains a cross-default provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of $150.0 million (after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders) would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under the facility.
total debt as a percent of total capitalization (excluding noncontrolling interests) increased to 31% at june 30, 2015 from 26% at june 30, 2014, primarily due to the issuance of the 2045 senior notes.
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was $1,943.3 million, $1,535.2 million and $1,226.3 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  the fiscal 2015 increase in cash flows provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflected a favorable change in accounts receivable, reflecting the timing of shipments and improved collections, a favorable change in inventory, reflecting our initiative to better align supply levels with forecasted demand and other supply chain improvements, and a favorable change in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments.  the accelerated orders in connection with our july 2014 smi implementation also contributed to the favorable changes in these working capital components and the decrease in net earnings as compared to fiscal 2014.  the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities during fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings, an increase in accrued income taxes as a result of the level and timing of tax payments, and an increase in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments. these changes were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable, which primarily reflected accelerated orders in connection with our july 2014 smi implementation.
net cash used for investing activities was $1,616.2 million, $511.6 million and $465.5 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  the fiscal 2015 increase as compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflected purchases of investments in connection with the implementation of our cash investment strategy, as previously discussed.  also contributing to the increase was cash paid in connection with the acquisitions of rodin olio lusso, le labo, editions de parfums frédéric malle and glamglow.  partially offsetting cash used for investing activities were proceeds from the disposition of investments and, to a lesser extent, lower capital expenditure activity.  the increase in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 primarily reflected higher capital expenditure activity related to leasehold improvements and counters.
net cash used for financing activities was $894.8 million, $856.9 million and $611.5 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  the fiscal 2015 increase in cash used for financing activities as compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflected an increase in treasury stock purchases and higher dividend payments, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of the 2045 senior notes.  the increase in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 primarily reflected an increase in treasury stock purchases which were partially offset by lower dividend payments that resulted from the transition to quarterly dividends in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and the final annual dividend payment made that year.  in addition, fiscal 2013 reflected the proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 senior notes and 2042 senior notes, which was partially offset by the redemption of the 2013 senior notes and repayment of commercial paper.
dividends for a summary of quarterly cash dividends declared per share on our class a and class b common stock during the year ended june 30, 2015, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 15  common stock.
pension and post-retirement plan funding several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans.  for the u.s. qualified plan, we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages.  for any future contributions to the u.s. qualified plan, we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended, (erisa) and subsequent pension legislation, and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.  for each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations.  in addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies and estimates.  the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump-sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions.
for the u.s. qualified plan, we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities.  this strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio.  during fiscal 2015, we made a cash contribution to the u.s. qualified plan of $25.0 million.  for fiscal 2015 and 2014, we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under erisa regulations for the u.s. qualified plan.  as we continue to monitor the funded status, we may decide to make cash contributions to the u.s. qualified plan or our post-retirement medical plan in the united states during fiscal 2016.
for fiscal 2015 and 2014, we made benefit payments under our non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan of $4.9 million and $7.2 million, respectively.  we expect to make benefit payments under this plan during fiscal 2016 of approximately $15 million.  for fiscal 2015 and 2014, we made benefit payments under our post-retirement plans of $6.3 million and $6.2 million, respectively.  we expect to make benefit payments under these plans during fiscal 2016 of approximately $6 million.  for fiscal 2015 and 2014, we made cash contributions to our international defined benefit pension plans of $22.8 million and $27.9 million, respectively.  we expect to make contributions under these plans during fiscal 2016 of approximately $23 million.
commitments and contingencies certain of our business acquisition agreements include contingent consideration or earn-out provisions.  these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business.  since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition.

market risk we use a value-at-risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments.  value-at-risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level.  we estimate value-at-risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250-day period.  the high, low and average measured value-at-risk during fiscal 2015 and 2014 related to our derivative financial instruments is as follows:
(in millions)                    high          low           average     high          low           average foreign exchange contracts       $28.6         $7.4          $17.8       $27.4         $7.4          $18.9
the model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level.  we used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths.
our calculated value-at-risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur.  it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year.  we believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities, other than operating leases, that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.
recently issued accounting standards refer to item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 2  summary of significant accounting policies for discussion regarding the impact of accounting standards that were recently issued but not yet effective, on our consolidated financial statements.
cautionary note regarding forward-looking information we and our representatives from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in this and other filings with the securities and exchange commission, in our press releases and in our reports to stockholders.  the words and phrases will likely result, expect, believe, planned, may, should, could, anticipate, estimate, project, intend, forecast or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.  these statements include, without limitation, our expectations regarding sales, earnings or other future financial performance and liquidity, product introductions, entry into new geographic regions, information systems initiatives, new methods of sale, our long-term strategy, restructuring and other charges and resulting cost savings, and future operations or operating results.  although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, actual results may differ materially from our expectations.  factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation:
(1) increased competitive activity from companies in the skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care businesses, some of which have greater resources than we do;
(2) our ability to develop, produce and market new products on which future operating results may depend and to successfully address challenges in our business;
(3) consolidations, restructurings, bankruptcies and reorganizations in the retail industry causing a decrease in the number of stores that sell our products, an increase in the ownership concentration within the retail industry, ownership of retailers by our competitors or ownership of competitors by our customers that are retailers and our inability to collect receivables;
(4) destocking and tighter working capital management by retailers;
(5) the success, or changes in timing or scope, of new product launches and the success, or changes in the timing or the scope, of advertising, sampling and merchandising programs;
(6) shifts in the preferences of consumers as to where and how they shop for the types of products and services we sell;
(7) social, political and economic risks to our foreign or domestic manufacturing, distribution and retail operations, including changes in foreign investment and trade policies and regulations of the host countries and of the united states;
(8) changes in the laws, regulations and policies (including the interpretations and enforcement thereof) that affect, or will affect, our business, including those relating to our products or distribution networks, changes in accounting standards, tax laws and regulations, environmental or climate change laws, regulations or accords, trade rules and customs regulations, and the outcome and expense of legal or regulatory proceedings, and any action we may take as a result;
(9) foreign currency fluctuations affecting our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets, the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors sell products in the same markets and our operating and manufacturing costs outside of the united states;
(10) changes in global or local conditions, including those due to the volatility in the global credit and equity markets, natural or man-made disasters, real or perceived epidemics, or energy costs, that could affect consumer purchasing, the willingness or ability of consumers to travel and/or purchase our products while traveling, the financial strength of our customers, suppliers or other contract counterparties, our operations, the cost and availability of capital which we may need for new equipment, facilities or acquisitions, the returns that we are able to generate on our pension assets and the resulting impact on funding obligations, the cost and availability of raw materials and the assumptions underlying our critical accounting estimates;
(11) shipment delays, commodity pricing, depletion of inventory and increased production costs resulting from disruptions of operations at any of the facilities that manufacture nearly all of our supply of a particular type of product (i.e. focus factories) or at our distribution or inventory centers, including disruptions that may be caused by the implementation of information technology initiatives, or by restructurings;
(12) real estate rates and availability, which may affect our ability to increase or maintain the number of retail locations at which we sell our products and the costs associated with our other facilities;
(13) changes in product mix to products which are less profitable;
(14) our ability to acquire, develop or implement new information and distribution technologies and initiatives on a timely basis and within our cost estimates and our ability to maintain continuous operations of such systems and the security of data and other information that may be stored in such systems or other systems or media;
(15) our ability to capitalize on opportunities for improved efficiency, such as publicly-announced strategies and restructuring and cost-savings initiatives, and to integrate acquired businesses and realize value therefrom;
(17) the timing and impact of acquisitions, investments and divestitures; and
(18) additional factors as described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission, including this annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2015.

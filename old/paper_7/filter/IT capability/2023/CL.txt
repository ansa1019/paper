item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview business organization colgate-palmolive company (together with its subsidiaries, "we," "us," "our," the "company" or "colgate") is a caring, innovative growth company reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and our planet. we seek to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and superior shareholder returns, as well as to provide colgate people with an innovative and inclusive work environment. we do this by developing and selling science-led products globally that make people's and their pets' lives healthier and more enjoyable and by embracing our sustainability and social impact and diversity, equity and inclusion ("de&i") strategies across our organization.
we are tightly focused on two product segments: oral, personal and home care; and pet nutrition. within these segments, we follow a closely defined business strategy to grow our key product categories and increase our overall market share. within the categories in which we compete, we prioritize our efforts based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization's core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable, profitable long-term growth.
operationally, we are organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. we compete in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to our sales and profitability. approximately two-thirds of our net sales are generated from markets outside the u.s., with approximately 45% of our net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of latin america, asia (excluding japan), africa/eurasia and central europe). this geographic diversity and balance help to reduce our exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.
the oral, personal and home care product segment is managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: north america, latin america, europe, asia pacific and africa/eurasia, all of which sell primarily to a variety of traditional and ecommerce retailers, wholesalers, distributors, dentists and, in some segments, skin health professionals. through hill's pet nutrition, we also compete on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling products principally through authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and ecommerce retailers. we also sell certain of our products direct-to-consumer. we are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale and have major manufacturing facilities, warehousing facilities and distribution centers in every region around the world.
on an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. these indicators include net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), a non-gaap financial measure, and gross profit margin, selling, general and administrative expenses, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, in each case, on a gaap and a non-gaap basis, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. in addition, we review market share and other data to assess how our brands are performing within their categories on a global and regional basis. the monitoring of these indicators and our code of conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls. for additional information regarding non-gaap financial measures and the company's use of market share data and the limitations of such data, see "non-gaap financial measures" and "market share information" below.
while the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business has largely abated, uncertainties continue in china, which is experiencing the ongoing effects of the pandemic and an economic slowdown, and in the travel retail channel, where we have experienced and may continue to experience disruptions in our filorga business. while we currently expect to be able to continue operating our business as described above, uncertainty resulting from covid-19 could result in unforeseen additional disruptions to our business, particularly in china and in the travel retail channel.
the war in ukraine the war in ukraine and the related geopolitical tensions have had and continue to have a significant impact on our operations in ukraine and russia, though it has not been material to our consolidated financial statements. the safety of our employees and partners in ukraine has been and remains our first priority. while our ability to do business in ukraine has been significantly impacted, we remain committed to providing access to our products to people in the region. in
russia, we are importing and selling a reduced portfolio of health and hygiene products for everyday use. we have no manufacturing facilities in russia and have ceased all capital investments and media activities in russia. for the year ended december 31, 2023 our business in the eurasia region constituted approximately 2% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 3% of our consolidated operating profit. we, however, have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, risks related to the impact of the war in ukraine, including increases in the costs and, in certain cases, limitations on the availability of certain raw and packaging materials and commodities (including oil and natural gas), supply chain and logistics challenges, import restrictions, foreign currency volatility and reputational concerns. we also have faced and continue to face challenges to our ability to repatriate cash from russia and find banking partners in russia and we may face challenges to our ability to protect our assets in russia. we also continue to monitor the impact of sanctions, export controls and import restrictions imposed in response to the war in ukraine.
the israel-hamas war the israel-hamas war has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. uncertainties and risks remain as to the duration of the war and its impact on geopolitical relations and stability in north africa, the middle east and nearby regions. the war has impacted and may continue to impact, among other things, supply chain and logistics, the availability and price of raw and packaging materials and commodities, such as oil, consumer sentiment and consumption and category growth rates in the region.
for more information about factors that could impact our business, including due to geopolitical conflicts, such as the war in ukraine and the israel-hamas war, refer to part i, item 1a "risk factors" of this annual report on form 10-k.
business strategy to achieve our business and financial objectives, we are focused on driving organic sales growth and long-term profitable growth through science-led, core and premium innovation; pursuing higher-growth adjacent categories and segments; expanding in faster-growing channels and markets and delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency. we continue to prioritize our investments in high growth segments within our oral care, personal care and pet nutrition businesses. we are also seeking to lead in the development of human capital, and to maximize the impact of our sustainability and social impact and de&i strategies. we are strengthening and leveraging our capabilities in areas such as innovation, digital, artificial intelligence, ecommerce and data and analytics, enabling us to be more responsive in today's rapidly changing world. in particular, we believe our digital transformation is of paramount importance to our success going forward. we continue to invest behind our brands, including through advertising, and to develop initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and traditional and ecommerce retailers. we also continue to broaden our ecommerce offerings, including direct-to-consumer and subscription services. we continue to believe that growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for our products.
the investments needed to drive growth are supported through continuous, company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. through these initiatives, which are referred to as our funding-the-growth initiatives, we seek to become even more effective and efficient throughout our businesses. these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through sku reductions and formulation simplification.
significant items impacting comparability during the quarter ended june 30, 2023, we reassessed with our legal and tax advisers certain tax deductions taken in prior years by one of our subsidiaries and concluded that it is more likely than not that the deductions would not be sustained by the courts in that jurisdiction. the value of the tax deductions was not material to us in any year in which they were taken. the cumulative effect of the change in tax position of $148 was reflected as a discrete item in the income tax expense in the quarter ended june 30, 2023, partially offset by the reversal of certain prior years' withholding tax reserves of $22 that are no longer required (hereinafter referred to as the "foreign tax matter"). the tax liability was paid in the quarter ended september 30, 2023. the current year impact of these changes is included in our full year effective income tax rate. see note 11, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
during the quarter ended march 31, 2023, we recorded a charge of $267 as a result of a decision of the united states court of appeals for the second circuit affirming a grant of summary judgment to the plaintiffs in a lawsuit under the employee retirement income security act seeking the recalculation of benefits and other relief associated with a 2005 residual annuity amendment to the colgate-palmolive company employees' retirement income plan (the "retirement plan"). the decision resulted in an increase in the obligations of the retirement plan, which based on the current funded status of the retirement plan will require no immediate cash contribution by the company. in june 2023, we filed a petition for certiorari to the united states supreme court requesting permission for an appeal to that court, which was denied in october 2023, and the plaintiffs filed a motion to enter a revised final judgment in the united states district court for the southern district of new york to address certain unresolved calculation issues, which we opposed. see note 13, commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
during the quarter ended march 31, 2023, we announced a voluntary recall of select fabuloso multi-purpose cleaner products sold in the united states and canada. the costs associated with the voluntary recall had a $25 impact on our operating profit in the quarter.
during the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded a non-cash charge of $721 pretax ($620 aftertax) to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets related to the filorga skin health business. the impairment was due primarily to the continued impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the filorga business, particularly in china, as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels, and the impact of significantly higher interest rates. see note 5, goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
on september 30, 2022, the company acquired a business, which operates three dry pet food manufacturing plants in the united states, for a purchase price, as adjusted, of $719, from red collar pet foods holdings, inc. and red collar pet foods holdings, l.p. (collectively, "red collar pet foods") to further support the global growth of the hill's pet nutrition business. see note 3, acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
on january 27, 2022, the company's board of directors (the "board") approved a targeted productivity program (the "2022 global productivity initiative"). the program is intended to reallocate resources towards our strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, drive efficiencies in our operations and streamline our supply chain to reduce structural costs. implementation of the 2022 global productivity initiative, which is expected to be substantially completed by mid-year 2024, is estimated to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, in the range of $200 to $240 ($170 to $200 aftertax). annualized pretax savings are projected to be in the range of $90 to $110 ($70 to $85 aftertax), once all projects are approved and implemented. savings achieved since the implementation of the 2022 global productivity initiative were approximately $100 pretax ($80 aftertax). for more information regarding the 2022 global productivity initiative, see "restructuring and related implementation charges" below.
in the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred pretax costs of $32 (aftertax costs of $25) and $110 (after tax costs of $87), respectively, resulting from the 2022 global productivity initiative.
outlook looking forward, we expect global macroeconomic, political and market conditions to remain challenging, including as a result of inflation and higher interest rates. during the year ended december 31, 2023, all of our divisions experienced significantly higher raw and packaging material costs. we have taken and are taking additional pricing to try to offset these increases in raw and packaging material costs. this has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact consumer demand for our products. additionally, inflation is impacting the broader economy with consumers around the world facing widespread rising prices as well as higher interest rates resulting from measures to address inflation. such inflation and higher interest rates may negatively impact consumer consumption or discretionary spending and/or change their purchasing patterns by foregoing purchasing certain of our products or by switching to "private label" or to our lower-priced product offerings. although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points, these changes could reduce demand for and sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings. in light of this challenging environment, we expect continued volatility across all of our categories and it is therefore difficult to predict category growth rates in the near term.
given that approximately two-thirds of our net sales originate in markets outside the u.s., we have experienced and will likely continue to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations. as discussed above, we have also experienced higher raw and packaging material costs. while we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, such as the 2022 global productivity initiative and our funding-the-growth and revenue growth management initiatives, in the current environment, it may become increasingly difficult to implement certain of these mitigation strategies. should these conditions persist, they could adversely affect our future results.
while the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, we continue to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors, from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do, and from new entrants into the market in many of our categories. such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion.
we have been negatively affected by changes in the policies and practices of our trade customers in key markets, such as inventory destocking, fulfillment requirements, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products and certain sustainability, supply chain and packaging standards or initiatives. in addition, the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the continued growth of ecommerce, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. we plan to continue to invest behind our data strategy, digital and analytics capabilities and higher growth businesses. the substantial growth in ecommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers.
we continue to closely monitor the impact of geopolitical events and tensions, such as the war in ukraine, the israel-hamas war and tensions between china and taiwan and the challenging market conditions discussed above on our business and the related uncertainties and risks. while we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effects of these events and conditions, we cannot estimate with certainty the full extent of their impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. for more information about factors that could impact our business, see "risk factors" in part i, item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k.
we believe that we are well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to our strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments, resilient global supply chain, dedicated and diverse global team and focused business strategy. our strategy is based on driving organic sales growth and long-term profitable growth; pursuing higher-growth adjacent categories and segments, expanding in faster growing channels and markets and delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency. we are also seeking to maximize the impact of our environmental, social and governance programs and to lead in the development of human capital, including our sustainability and social impact and de&i strategies, which we are working to integrate across our organization. our commitment to these priorities, the strength of our brands, the breadth of our global footprint and a commitment to profitability and driving efficiency in cash generation should position us well to manage through the challenges we face and increase shareholder value over time.

goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2022, the company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its filorga reporting unit due primarily to the continued impact of the covid-19 pandemic, particularly in china, as a result of government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility, which negatively impacted consumption in the duty-free, travel retail and pharmacy channels. the company concluded that the changes in circumstances in this reporting unit and the impact of significantly higher interest rates triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its indefinite-lived trademark, goodwill and long-lived assets which consists primarily of customer relationships. as a result of the interim impairment test, the company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark and customer relationships exceeded their estimated fair value and recorded impairment charges of $300 and $89, respectively. after adjusting the carrying values of the trademark and customer relationship intangible assets, the company completed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $332 in the filorga reporting unit.

(1) the income tax effect on non-gaap items is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-gaap adjustment.
(2) the impact of non-gaap items on the company's effective tax rate represents the difference in the effective tax rate calculated with and without the non-gaap adjustment on income before income taxes and provision for income taxes.
the effective income tax rate in all years benefited from tax planning associated with the company's global business initiatives.
in the third quarter of 2023, the internal revenue service (the "irs") issued a notice giving taxpayers temporary relief from the effects of certain u.s. tax regulations that were issued in december 2021, which place greater restrictions on foreign taxes that are creditable against u.s. taxes on foreign-source income. this notice allowed taxpayers to defer the application of these new regulations through the end of 2023. in december 2023, the irs issued further guidance modifying this temporary relief period to the date that a notice or other guidance withdrawing or modifying the temporary relief is issued.
in the second quarter of 2023, the company reassessed with its legal and tax advisers certain tax deductions taken in prior years by one of its subsidiaries and concluded that it is more likely than not that the deductions would not be sustained by the courts in that jurisdiction. the value of the tax deductions was not material to the company in any year in which they were taken. the cumulative effect of the change in tax position of $148 was reflected as a discrete item in the second quarter's income tax expense, partially offset by the reversal of certain prior years' withholding tax reserves of $22 that are no longer required. the tax liability was paid in the quarter ended september 30, 2023. the current year impact of these changes is included in the company's full year effective income tax rate.
on august 16, 2022, the inflation reduction act of 2022 ("ira") was enacted, which among other things, implements a 15% minimum tax on book income of certain large corporations effective for years beginning after december 31, 2022. based on the company's analysis, as well as recently published guidance by the irs, the ira, and in particular the 15% minimum tax, did not have an impact on the company's consolidated financial statements. the company will continue to evaluate the potential impact of this law as additional guidance and clarification becomes available.
additionally, on december 15, 2022, the 27 member states of the european union ("eu") reached an agreement on a minimum level of taxation for certain large corporations to pay a minimum corporate tax rate of 15% in every jurisdiction in which they operate. this agreement, which is known as the minimum tax directive (part of the "pillar ii model rules"), was supposed to be transposed into the laws of all eu member states by december 31, 2023. most member states complied while some were granted extensions of time. in addition, many other jurisdictions outside the eu have also committed to implement this directive while others have implemented a similar minimum tax regime consistent with the policy of the pillar ii model rules. the company is currently evaluating the impact of this directive and believes that the impact on its consolidated financial statements will not be material.
the company has ongoing federal, state and international income tax audits in various jurisdictions and evaluates uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local tax authorities and not fully sustained. all u.s. federal income tax returns through december 31, 2013 have been audited by the irs and there are limited matters which the company plans to appeal for years 2010 through 2013. one such matter relates to the irs assessment of taxes on the company by imputing income on certain activities within one of our international operations, which is also under audit for the years 2014 through 2018. there were u.s. tax court rulings during 2023 in favor of the irs against unrelated third parties on similar matters. despite the u.s. tax court rulings, the company continues to believe that the tax assessment against the company is without merit. while there can be no assurances, the company believes this matter will ultimately be decided in favor of the company. the amount of tax plus interest for the years 2010 through 2018 is estimated to be approximately $145, which is not included in the company's uncertain tax positions.
net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company and earnings per share net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company was $2,300, or $2.77 per share on a diluted basis, in 2023, an increase from $1,785, or $2.13 per share on a diluted basis, in 2022. in 2023, net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company included charges resulting from the erisa litigation matter, the foreign tax matter, the 2022 global productivity initiative and product recall costs. in 2022, net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company included goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges, charges resulting from the 2022 global productivity initiative, a gain on the sale of land in asia pacific and acquisition-related costs.

restructuring and related implementation charges on january 27, 2022, the board approved the 2022 global productivity initiative. the program is intended to reallocate resources towards the company's strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, drive efficiencies in the company's operations and streamline the company's supply chain to reduce structural costs.
implementation of the 2022 global productivity initiative, which is expected to be substantially completed by mid-year 2024, is estimated to result in cumulative pre-tax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, in the range of $200 to $240 ($170 to $200 aftertax), which is currently estimated to be comprised of the following: employee-related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (80%); asset-related costs, primarily accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs (10%); and other charges (10%), which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies. it is estimated that approximately 80% to 90% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. annualized pre-tax savings are projected to be in the range of $90 to $110 ($70 to $85 aftertax), once all projects are approved and implemented. savings achieved since the implementation of the 2022 global productivity initiative were approximately $100 pretax ($80 aftertax).
it is expected that the cumulative pretax charges, once all projects are approved and implemented, will relate to initiatives undertaken in north america (5%), latin america (10%), europe (45%), asia pacific (5%), africa/eurasia (10%), hill's pet nutrition (10%) and corporate (15%).

the following table summarizes the activity for the restructuring and related implementation charges discussed above and the related accruals:
employee-related costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits and are calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, written severance policies, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. employee-related costs also include pension enhancements of $5 for the twelve months ended december 31, 2023 and $15 for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, which are reflected as charges against assets within employee-related costs in the preceding tables as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets or an increase in pension liabilities.
non-gaap financial measures this annual report on form 10-k discusses certain financial measures on both a gaap and a non-gaap basis. the company uses the non-gaap financial measures described below internally in its budgeting process, to evaluate segment and overall operating performance and as a factor in determining compensation. the company believes that these non-gaap financial measures are useful in evaluating the company's underlying business performance and trends; however, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap. in addition, these non-gaap financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.
net sales growth (gaap) and organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-gaap) are discussed in this annual report on form 10-k. management believes the organic sales growth measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the company's underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding, the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments, as applicable. a reconciliation of organic sales growth to net sales growth for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 is provided below.
gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales, other (income) expense, net, operating profit, operating profit margin, non-service related postretirement costs, effective income tax rate, net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company and earnings per share on a diluted basis are discussed in this annual report on form 10-k both on a gaap basis and excluding, as applicable, charges resulting from the erisa litigation matter, the foreign tax matter and the 2022 global productivity initiative, product recall costs, goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges, a gain on the sale of land in asia pacific and acquisition-related costs. these non-gaap financial measures exclude items that, either by their nature or amount, management would not expect to occur as part of the company's normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges, charges for certain litigation and tax matters, acquisition-related costs, gains and losses from certain divestitures and certain other unusual, non-recurring items. investors and analysts use these financial measures in assessing the company's business performance, and management believes that presenting these financial measures on a non-gaap basis provides them with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company's underlying business performance and trends. these non-gaap financial measures also enhance the ability to compare period-to-period financial results. a reconciliation of each of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 is presented within the applicable section of results of operations.
the following tables provide a quantitative reconciliation of net sales growth to organic sales growth for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 versus the prior year:

market share information management uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. references to market share in this annual report on form 10-k are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily nielsen, and internal estimates. all market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the company competes and purchases data (excluding venezuela from all periods).
market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information. in particular, market share data is currently not generally available for certain retail channels, such as ecommerce or certain discounters. the company measures year-to-date market shares from january 1 of the relevant year through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. the company believes that the third-party vendors we use to provide data are reliable, but we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. in addition, market share information calculated by the company may be different from market share information calculated by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors.
liquidity and capital resources the company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions). the company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.
cash flow net cash provided by operations increased to $3,745 in 2023 as compared to $2,556 in 2022, primarily due to changes in working capital and higher net income. the company's working capital as a percentage of net sales was (1.4)% in 2023 and 1.0% in 2022. this change in working capital as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to higher accounts payable and accruals, and lower inventory. the company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt).
investing activities used $742 of cash in 2023 compared to $1,601 during 2022. investing activities in 2022 included the company's acquisition of businesses from red collar pet foods and nutriamo discussed in note 3, acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements.
capital expenditures in the year ended december 31, 2023 were $705, an increase from $696 in 2022. capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be approximately 3.0% of net sales. the company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns.
financing activities used $2,793 of cash during 2023 compared to $952 during 2022. the increase in cash used was primarily due to higher repayments of commercial paper and higher principal payment of debt in 2023.
in august 2022, the company issued $500 of three-year senior notes at a fixed coupon rate of 3.100%, $500 of five-year senior notes at a fixed coupon rate of 3.100% and $500 of ten-year senior notes at a fixed coupon rate of 3.250%. in march 2023, the company issued $500 of three-year senior notes at a fixed coupon rate of 4.800%, $500 of five-year senior notes at a fixed coupon rate of 4.600% and $500 of ten-year senior notes at a fixed coupon rate of 4.600%. the company's debt issuances support the company's capital structure objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital.
at december 31, 2023, the company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $3,574 (including under the facility discussed below) and could also issue long-term debt pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement.
in november 2022, the company entered into an amended and restated $3,000 five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for a five-year term expiring november 2027, which replaced, on substantially similar terms, the company's $3,000 revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in august 2026. in november 2023, the company extended the term of the credit facility for an additional year, expiring in november 2028. commitment fees related to the credit facility were not material.
domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $906 and $1,778 as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively. the average daily balances outstanding of commercial paper in 2023 and 2022 were $1,800 and $1,858, respectively. the company classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its available lines of credit (under the facilities discussed above).
weighted average interest rate                 maturities                outstanding                 weighted average                 maturities                outstanding interest rate commercial paper                                     4.0            %                       2024                  906                            2.1       %                       2023                1,778
certain of the agreements with respect to the company's bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. the company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. refer to note 6, long-term debt and credit facilities to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the company's long-term debt and credit facilities.
the company repurchases shares of its common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. on march 10, 2022, the board authorized the repurchase of shares of the company's common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to $5 billion under a new share repurchase program (the "2022 program"), which replaced a previously authorized share repurchase program (the "2018 program"). the board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the company's compensation and benefit programs. the shares are repurchased from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions at the company's discretion, subject to market conditions, customary blackout periods and other factors.
aggregate share repurchases in 2023 consisted of approximately 14.7 million common shares under the 2022 program and 0.3 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,128. aggregate repurchases in 2022 consisted of approximately 13.4 million common shares under the 2022 program, 3.4 million common shares under the 2018 program and 0.3 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,308. share repurchases net of proceeds from exercise of stock options were $748 and $890 in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
the following represents the scheduled maturities of the company's contractual obligations as of december 31, 2023:
(1)the company classifies commercial paper and notes maturing within the next twelve months as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis. the amounts in this table exclude commercial paper.
(2)includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt. interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management's best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.
(3)the company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2023 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. these purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which
are based on agreements that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.
long-term liabilities associated with the company's postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. the amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on the variability of the market value of the assets, changes in the benefit obligations, local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in "critical accounting policies and use of estimates" below) and voluntary company contributions. based on current information, the company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified u.s. pension plan in 2024. the company does not expect to make any voluntary contributions to its u.s. postretirement plans in 2024. in addition, total benefit payments expected to be paid from the company's assets to participants in unfunded plans are estimated to be approximately $98 for the year ending december 31, 2024.
additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. see note 11, income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
as more fully described in note 13, commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements, the company has commitments and contingencies with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
off-balance sheet arrangements the company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.
managing foreign currency, interest rate, commodity price and credit risk exposure the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the company's treasury and risk management policies. the company's treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.
the sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. see note 2, summary of significant accounting policies and note 7, fair value measurements and financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.
foreign exchange risk as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. the company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. see "results of operations" above for a discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each operating segment.
the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders' equity. income and expense items are translated into u.s. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.
the company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, option contracts, foreign and local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.
interest rate risk the company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. the company utilizes forward-starting interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of variability in interest rate for future debt issuances. the notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates.
commodity price risk the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, essential oils, tropical oils, pulp, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans. the company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the hill's pet nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.
the company's open commodity derivative contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized loss of $1 at december 31, 2023 versus a net unrealized gain of $1 in 2022. at the end of 2023, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $2.
credit risk the company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the company's policy to contract with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations.

critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment and make estimates. the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. the company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors.
in certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. the company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for inventories and shipping and handling costs.
▪shipping and handling costs (also referred to as logistics costs) may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. the company accounts for such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, as fulfillment costs and reports them in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. accordingly, the company's gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. if such costs had been included as a component of cost of sales, the company's gross profit margin would have been lower by 910 bps in 2023, 1040 bps in 2022 and 970 bps in 2021, with no impact on reported earnings.
the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances, legal and other contingency reserves.
▪in accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for u.s. defined benefit plans was 5.40% and 5.66% as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other u.s. postretirement plans was 5.37% and 5.67% as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. discount rates used for the u.s. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans. the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for u.s. plans was 6.50% as of december 31, 2023 and 6.25% as of december 31, 2022. in determining the expected long-term rate of return, the company considers the nature of the plans' investments and the historical rate of return.
average annual rates of return for the u.s. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 10%, 5%, 4%, 6% and 5%, respectively. in addition, the current assumed rate of return for the u.s. plans is based upon the nature of the plans' investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 60% in fixed income securities, 26% in equity securities and 14% in other investments. a 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the u.s. pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company by approximately $12. a 1% change in the discount rate for the u.s. pension plans and u.s. other retiree benefit plan would impact future net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company by approximately $0 and $2, respectively. a third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase for the pension plans, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the expected long-term rate of return. this rate was 3.50% as of december 31, 2023 and 2022. refer to note 10, retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's pension and other postretirement plans.
▪the assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits (other than the discount rate noted above) is the medical cost trend rate. the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. the assumed rate of increase for the u.s. postretirement benefit plans is 6.00% for 2024, declining to 4.88% by 2028 and remaining at 4.50% for the years thereafter. a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would impact future net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company by $2.
▪the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units (both performance-based and time-vested), based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. the company uses the black-scholes-merton ("black-scholes") option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. the weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended december 31, 2023 was $14.89. the black-scholes model uses various assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. these assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards, expected volatility rate, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. while these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards. a one-year change in expected term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 6%. a 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 4%. the company uses a monte-carlo simulation to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units at the date of grant. the monte-carlo simulation model uses substantially the same inputs as the black-scholes model.
▪goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, such as the company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired. in assessing impairment, the company performs either a quantitative or a qualitative analysis.
determining the fair value of the company's reporting units for goodwill and the fair value of its intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgments by management. when a quantitative analysis is performed, the company generally uses the income approach, which requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management's strategic plans, sales growth rates and the selection of royalty rates and discount rates. estimating sales growth rates requires significant judgment by management in areas such as future economic conditions, category growth rates, product pricing, consumer tastes and preferences and future expansion expectations. in selecting an appropriate royalty rate, the company considers the long-term profitability of the brand and recent market transactions for similar brands and products. in determining an appropriate discount rate, the company considers the current interest rate environment and its estimated cost of capital. other qualitative factors the company considers, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance. the company generally engages a third-party valuation firm to assist it in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.
in determining the fair value of the company's reporting units, fair value is also determined using the market approach, which is generally derived from metrics of comparable publicly traded companies. as multiple valuation methodologies are used, the company also performs a qualitative analysis comparing the fair value of a reporting unit under each method to assess its reasonableness and ensure consistency of results.
as of the date of the annual goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the filorga reporting unit in the europe segment approximates its carrying value. the carrying value of goodwill associated with this reporting unit is $221 as of december 31, 2023. the estimated fair value of the company's remaining reporting units substantially exceeds their carrying value.
as of the date of the annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value of one of the company's indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets approximates its carrying value. the carrying value of this trademark is $312 as of december 31, 2023.
given the inherent uncertainties of estimating the future impacts of interest rates and inflation on macroeconomic conditions, actual results may differ from management's current estimates, which could potentially result in additional impairment charges in future periods.
▪the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.
▪legal and other contingency reserves are based on management's assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors. such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. while it is possible that the company's cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, based on current knowledge it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material effect on the company's financial position, or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. refer to note 13, commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's contingencies.
the company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. refer to note 2, summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company's significant accounting policies.
cautionary statement on forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k may contain forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 or by the sec in its rules, regulations and releases that set forth anticipated results based on management's current plans and assumptions. such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, net selling price increases, organic sales growth, profit or profit margin levels, earnings per share levels, financial goals, the impact of foreign exchange, the impact of geopolitical conflicts and tensions, such as the war in ukraine, the israel-hamas war and tensions between china and taiwan, cost-reduction plans (including the 2022 global productivity initiative), tax rates, interest rates, new product introductions, digital capabilities, commercial investment levels, acquisitions, divestitures, share repurchases or legal or tax proceedings, among other matters. these statements are made on the basis of the company's views and assumptions as of this time and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the sec. moreover, the company does not nor does any other person assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of those statements. the company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual events or results may differ materially from those statements. actual events or results may differ materially because of factors that affect international businesses and global economic conditions, as well as matters specific to the company and the markets it serves, including the uncertain macroeconomic and political environment in different countries, including as a result of inflation and rising interest rates, and its effect on consumer confidence and spending, foreign currency rate fluctuations, exchange controls, import restrictions, tariffs, sanctions, price or profit controls, labor relations, changes in foreign or domestic laws or regulations or their interpretation, political and fiscal developments, including changes in trade, tax and immigration policies, increased competition and evolving competitive practices (including from the growth of ecommerce and the entry of new competitors and business models), the ability to operate and respond effectively during a pandemic, epidemic or widespread public health concern, the ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain and/or key office facilities, the ability to manage the availability and cost of raw and packaging materials and logistics costs, the ability to maintain or increase selling prices as needed, changes in the policies of retail trade customers, the emergence of alternative retail channels, the growth of ecommerce and the rapidly changing retail landscape (as consumers increasingly shop online and through mobile applications), the ability to develop innovative new products, the ability to continue lowering costs and operate in an agile manner, the ability to maintain the security of our information and operational technology systems from a cybersecurity incident or data breach, the ability to address the effects of climate change and achieve our sustainability and social impact goals, the ability to complete acquisitions and divestitures as planned, the ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses, the ability to attract and retain key employees and integrate de&i initiatives across our organization, the uncertainty of the outcome of legal proceedings, whether or not the company believes they have merit, and the ability to address uncertain or unfavorable global economic conditions, including inflation, disruptions in the credit markets and tax matters. for information about these and other factors that could impact the company's business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, refer to part i, item 1a "risk factors."

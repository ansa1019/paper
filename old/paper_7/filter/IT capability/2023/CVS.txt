item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. ("md&a")
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k (this "10-k"), "risk factors" included in item 1a of this 10-k and the "cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements" in this 10-k.
overview of business cvs health corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, "cvs health," the "company," "we," "our" or "us"), is a leading health solutions company building a world of health around every consumer it serves and connecting care so that it works for people wherever they are. as of december 31, 2023, the company had more than 9,000 retail locations, more than 1,000 walk-in medical clinics, 204 primary care medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 108 million plan members and expanding specialty pharmacy solutions, and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year. the company also serves an estimated more than 35 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including expanding medicare advantage offerings and a leading standalone medicare part d prescription drug plan ("pdp"). the company is creating new sources of value through its integrated model allowing it to expand into personalized, technology driven care delivery and health services, increasing access to quality care, delivering better health outcomes and lowering overall health care costs.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, the company completed the acquisition of two key health care delivery assets to enhance its ability to execute on its care delivery strategy by advancing its primary care, home-based care and provider enablement capabilities. on march 29, 2023, the company acquired signify health, inc. ("signify health"), a leader in health risk assessments, value-based care and provider enablement services. on may 2, 2023, the company also acquired oak street health, inc. ("oak street health"), a leading multi-payor operator of value-based primary care centers serving medicare eligible patients. both signify health and oak street health are included within the health services segment.
in connection with its new operating model adopted in the first quarter of 2023, the company realigned the composition of its segments to reflect how its chief operating decision maker (the "codm") reviews information and manages the business. the company's codm is the chief executive officer. as a result of this realignment, the company formed a new health services segment, which in addition to providing a full range of pharmacy benefit management ("pbm") solutions, also delivers health care services in the company's medical clinics, virtually, and in the home, as well as provider enablement solutions. in addition, the company created a new pharmacy & consumer wellness segment, which includes its retail and long-term care pharmacy operations and related pharmacy services, as well as its retail front store operations. this segment will also provide pharmacy fulfillment services to support the health services segment's specialty and mail order pharmacy offerings. prior period segment financial information has been recast to conform with the current period presentation. see note 19 ''segment reporting'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for segment financial information.
the company has four reportable segments: health care benefits, health services, pharmacy & consumer wellness and corporate/other, which are described below.
overview of the health care benefits segment the health care benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers. the health care benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. the health care benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, medicare advantage and medicare supplement plans, pdps and medicaid health care management services. the health care benefits segment's customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers ("providers"), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. the company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as "insured" and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as "asc." the company sold insured plans directly to individual consumers through the individual public health insurance exchanges ("public exchanges") in 12 states as of december 31, 2023. the company entered public exchanges in five additional states effective january 2024.
overview of the health services segment the health services segment provides a full range of pbm solutions, delivers health care services in its medical clinics, virtually, and in the home, and offers provider enablement solutions. pbm solutions include plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services, and specialty and mail order pharmacy services. in addition, the company provides clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providers and federal 340b drug pricing program covered entities ("covered entities"). the company operates a group purchasing organization that negotiates pricing for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and rebates with pharmaceutical manufacturers on behalf of its participants and provides various administrative, management and reporting services to pharmaceutical manufacturers. during 2023, the company completed the acquisition of two key health care delivery assets - signify health, a leader in health risk assessments, value-based care and provider enablement services, and oak street health, a leading multi-payor operator of value-based primary care centers serving medicare eligible patients. the company also announced the launch of cordavistm, a wholly owned subsidiary that will work directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers to commercialize and/or co-produce high quality biosimilar products. the health services segment's clients and customers are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, pdps, medicaid managed care plans, cms, plans offered on insurance exchanges and other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the u.s., patients who receive care in the health services segment's medical clinics, virtually or in the home, as well as covered entities.
overview of the pharmacy & consumer wellness segment the pharmacy & consumer wellness segment dispenses prescriptions in its retail pharmacies and through its infusion operations, provides ancillary pharmacy services including pharmacy patient care programs, diagnostic testing and vaccination administration, and sells a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise. the segment also conducts long-term care pharmacy ("ltc") operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings, and provides pharmacy fulfillment services to support the health services segment's specialty and mail order pharmacy offerings. as of december 31, 2023, the pharmacy & consumer wellness segment operated more than 9,000 retail locations, as well as online retail pharmacy websites, ltc pharmacies and on-site pharmacies, retail specialty pharmacy stores, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.
overview of the corporate/other segment the company presents the remainder of its financial results in the corporate/other segment, which primarily consists of:
•management and administrative expenses to support the company's overall operations, which include certain aspects of executive management and the corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources and finance departments, information technology, digital, data and analytics, as well as acquisition-related transaction and integration costs; and
•products for which the company no longer solicits or accepts new customers such as its large case pensions and long-term care insurance products.
the coronavirus disease 2019 ("covid-19") continues to impact the economies of the u.s. and other countries around the world. the impact of covid-19 on the company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition in the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, as well as information regarding certain expected impacts of covid-19 on the company, is discussed throughout this annual report on form 10-k.
results of operations the following information summarizes the company's results of operations for 2023 compared to 2022. financial information for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 has been revised to reflect the impact of the following items, as applicable:
•the realignment of the company's segments to correspond with changes made to its operating model as described in note 1 ''significant accounting policies'' included in item 8 of this form 10-k, including the discontinuance of the former maintenance choice® segment reporting practice as described within the "segment analysis" section of this item 7.
•the impact of the adoption of a new accounting standard related to the accounting for long-duration insurance contracts (the "long-duration insurance accounting standard"), which the company adopted on january 1, 2023 using a modified retrospective transition method as of january 1, 2021, as described in note 1 "significant accounting policies" included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
•the exclusion of the impact of net realized capital gains or losses from adjusted operating income, as described within the "segment analysis" section of this item 7.
for discussion of the company's results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with retrospective adjustments" for the year ended december 31, 2022, which was revised to reflect the items noted above and is included in exhibit 99.1 to the company's current report on form 8-k filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (the "sec") on may 25, 2023.
opioid litigation charges                                                   -                         5,803                             -                  (5,803)                     (100.0)   %                  5,803                       100.0   %
•please see "segment analysis" later in this md&a for additional information about the revenues of the company's segments.
•operating expenses increased $1.6 billion, or 4.2%, in 2023 compared to 2022. the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased operating expenses to support growth in the business, operating expenses associated with oak street health and signify health, including the amortization of acquired intangible assets, incremental investments in business operations, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs recorded in 2023 and the absence of a $250 million pre-tax gain on the sale of bswift llc ("bswift") and a $225 million pre-tax gain on the sale of payflex holdings, inc. ("payflex") recorded in 2022. these increases were partially offset by gains from anti-trust legal settlements and the favorable impact of business initiatives in 2023.
•please see "segment analysis" later in this md&a for additional information about the operating expenses of the company's segments.
•operating income increased $5.8 billion, or 72.8%, in 2023 compared to 2022. the increase in operating income was primarily driven by the absence of $5.8 billion of opioid litigation charges recorded in 2022 and increases in the pharmacy & consumer wellness segment, primarily driven by the absence of a $2.5 billion loss on assets held for sale recorded in 2022 related to the write-down of the company's omnicare® long-term care business ("ltc business") which was partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased covid-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing compared to 2022, as well as an increase in the health services segment. these increases in operating income were partially offset by declines in the health care benefits segment, including the absence of the $250 million pre-tax gain on the sale of bswift and the $225 million pre-tax gain on the sale of payflex recorded in 2022, as well as the restructuring charges and acquisition-related transaction and integration costs recorded in 2023.
•please see "segment analysis" later in this md&a for additional information about the operating results of the company's segments.
•interest expense increased $371 million, or 16.2%, in 2023 compared to 2022, due to higher debt in the year ended december 31, 2023 to fund the acquisitions of signify health and oak street health. see "liquidity and capital resources" later in this report for additional information.
•the company's effective income tax rate decreased to 25.1% in 2023 compared to 25.9% in the prior year. the decrease was primarily due to the absence of certain nondeductible legal charges and basis differences on the sale of bswift and payflex in 2022. these decreases were partially offset by the absence of the impact of certain discrete tax items concluded in 2022.
•the company expects growth in its new cordavis, oak street health and signify health businesses.
•competitive pressures in the pbm industry have caused the company to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. in addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network "differential" or "spread." the company expects these trends to continue.
•competitive pressures in the retail pharmacy industry are increasing, resulting in aggressive generic pricing programs, the growth of discount cards and increased utilization of digital commerce.
•future costs are influenced by a number of factors including competitive demand for products and services, legislative and regulatory considerations, and labor and other market dynamics, including inflation. we evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the markets we serve, considering all relevant factors.
•the company expects benefits from enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives and investments in efficiencies, which aim to reduce the company's operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable.
•the company is exposed to funding and regulation of, and changes in government policy with respect to and/or funding or regulation of, the various medicare programs in which the company participates, including changes in the amounts payable to us under those programs and/or new reforms or surcharges on existing programs, including changes to applicable risk adjustment mechanisms.
•legislation and/or regulations seeking to regulate pbm activities in a comprehensive manner have been proposed or enacted in a majority of states and on the federal level. this legislative and regulatory activity could adversely affect the company's ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms and the company's ability to standardize its pbm products and services across state lines.
for additional information regarding these and other trends and uncertainties, see item 1a, "risk factors" and part i, item 1 "business - government regulation."
segment analysis the following discussion of segment operating results is presented based on the company's reportable segments in accordance with the accounting guidance for segment reporting and is consistent with the segment disclosure in note 19 ''segment reporting'' included in item 8 of this 10-k.
the company has three operating segments, health care benefits, health services and pharmacy & consumer wellness, as well as a corporate/other segment. the company's segments maintain separate financial information, and the codm evaluates the segments' operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. the codm evaluates the performance of the company's segments based on adjusted operating income. adjusted operating income is defined as operating income as measured by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap") excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the company's business nor reflect the company's underlying business performance. effective for the first quarter of 2023, adjusted operating income also excludes the impact of net realized capital gains or losses. see the reconciliations of operating income (gaap measure) to adjusted operating income below for further context regarding the items excluded from operating income in determining adjusted operating income. the company uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the company's ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. non-gaap financial measures the company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with gaap.
segment financial information for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 has been revised to conform with the current period presentation for the following items:
•the realignment of the company's segments to correspond with changes made to its operating model as described in note 1 ''significant accounting policies'' included in item 8 of this 10-k, including the discontinuance of the former maintenance choice segment reporting practice as described in note (2) of the table included on the next page.
•the impact of the adoption of the long-duration insurance accounting standard, which the company adopted on january 1, 2023 using a modified retrospective transition method as of january 1, 2021, as described in note 1 "significant accounting policies" included in item 8 of this 10-k.
•the exclusion of the impact of net realized capital gains or losses from adjusted operating income, as described above.
the impact of these items on segment financial information for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 is reflected in the "adjustments" lines of the table included on the next page.
in millions                                                          health care                  healthservices (1)       pharmacy &amp;                   corporate/                 intersegmenteliminations (2)                  consolidated benefits                                                 consumer                        other                                                                     totals wellness
(1)total revenues of the health services segment include approximately $13.7 billion, $12.6 billion and $11.6 billion of retail co-payments for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. see note 1 ''significant accounting policies'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for additional information about retail co-payments.
(2)intersegment revenue eliminations relate to intersegment revenue generating activities that occur between the health care benefits segment, the health services segment, and/or the pharmacy & consumer wellness segment. prior to january 1, 2023, intersegment adjusted operating income eliminations occurred when members of the health services segment's clients enrolled in maintenance choice® elected to pick up maintenance prescriptions at one of the company's retail pharmacies instead of receiving them through the mail. when this occurred, both the health services and pharmacy & consumer wellness segments recorded the adjusted operating income on a stand-alone basis. effective january 1, 2023, the adjusted operating income associated with such transactions is reported only in the pharmacy & consumer wellness segment, therefore no adjusted operating income elimination is required. segment financial information has been recast to reflect this change.

(1)the company's acquisition activities have resulted in the recognition of intangible assets as required under the acquisition method of accounting which consist primarily of trademarks, customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete, technology, provider networks and value of business acquired. definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. the amortization of intangible assets is reflected in the company's gaap consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within each segment. although intangible assets contribute to the company's revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the underwriting of the company's insurance products, the services performed for the company's customers or the sale of the company's products or services. additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the company's acquisition activity. accordingly, the company believes excluding the amortization of intangible assets enhances the company's and investors' ability to compare the company's past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-gaap financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the company's gaap financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-gaap financial measure. intangible asset amortization is excluded from the related non-gaap financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised.
(2)the company's net realized capital gains and losses arise from various types of transactions, primarily in the course of managing a portfolio of assets that support the payment of insurance liabilities. net realized capital gains and losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in net investment income within each segment. these capital gains and losses are the result of investment decisions, market conditions and other economic developments that are unrelated to the performance of the company's business, and the amount and timing of these capital gains and losses do not directly relate to the underwriting of the company's insurance products, the services performed for the company's customers or the sale of the company's products or services. accordingly, the company believes excluding net realized capital gains and losses enhances the company's and investors' ability to compare the company's past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends.
(3)in 2023, the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relate to the acquisitions of signify health and oak street health. in 2021, the acquisition-related integration costs relate to the acquisition ("the aetna acquisition") of aetna inc.

medical benefit ratio
•medical benefit ratio is calculated as health care costs divided by premium revenues and represents the percentage of premium revenues spent on medical benefits for the company's insured members. management uses mbr to assess the underlying business performance and underwriting of its insurance products, understand variances between actual results and expected results and identify trends in period-over-period results. mbr provides management and investors with information useful in assessing the operating results of the company's insured health care benefits products.
•the mbr increased from 83.8% to 86.2% in 2023 compared to the prior year primarily driven by increased utilization in medicare advantage, including outpatient and supplemental benefits, when compared with pandemic influenced utilization levels in the prior year, as well as commercial and medicaid trends returning to normalized levels, consistent with pricing expectations.
•during 2022, the company recorded a $41 million loss on assets held for sale on its thailand business, which is included in the commercial business reporting unit within the health care benefits segment. see note 2 ''acquisitions, divestitures and asset sales'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for additional information.
•operating expenses in the health care benefits segment include selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses.
•operating expenses increased $1.6 billion, or 11.2%, in 2023 compared to 2022. the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased operating expenses to support the growth across all product lines described above, incremental investments in the business, including investments in service capabilities and member experience, as well as the absence of a $250 million pre-tax gain on the sale of bswift and a $225 million pre-tax gain on the sale of payflex recorded in the prior year.
•adjusted operating income decreased $761 million, or 12.0%, in 2023 compared to 2022. the decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by increased utilization in medicare advantage when compared with pandemic influenced utilization levels in the prior year, as well as incremental investments in the business, including investments in service capabilities and member experience. these decreases were partially offset by higher net investment income in 2023 compared to 2022.
the following table summarizes the health care benefits segment's medical membership as of december 31, 2023 and 2022:
•medical membership represents the number of members covered by the company's insured and asc medical products and related services at a specified point in time. management uses this metric to understand variances between actual medical membership and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. this metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of medical membership on segment total revenues and operating results.
•medical membership as of december 31, 2023 of 25.7 million increased 1.3 million members compared with december 31, 2022, reflecting increases in the commercial and medicare product lines, including an increase of 1.3 million members related to the individual exchange business within the commercial product line. these increases were partially offset by a decline in the medicaid product line, primarily attributable to the resumption of medicaid redeterminations following the expiration of the phe.
medicare update on march 31, 2023, cms issued its final notice detailing final 2024 medicare advantage payment rates. final 2024 medicare advantage rates resulted in an expected average decrease in revenue for the medicare advantage industry of 1.12%, excluding the cms estimate of medicare advantage risk score trend. on january 31, 2024, cms issued an advance notice detailing proposed 2025 medicare advantage payment rates. the 2025 medicare advantage rates, if finalized as proposed, will result in an expected average decrease in revenue for the medicare advantage industry of 0.16%, excluding the cms estimate of medicare advantage risk score trend. cms intends to publish the final 2025 rate announcement no later than april 1, 2024.
on october 13, 2023, cms released its 2024 star ratings for medicare advantage and pdps. based on the 2024 star ratings, which will impact total revenues in 2025, the percentage of aetna medicare advantage members in 4+ star plans is expected to return to 87% based on the company's membership as of december 2023, as compared to the unmitigated 21% in the prior year. the main driver of this increase was a half star improvement in the aetna national preferred provider organization ("ppo") plan, which increased from 3.5 stars to 4.0 stars. as previously discussed, the decline in membership in 4+ star plans for payment year 2024 resulted in a mitigated 2024 headwind of approximately $800 million to $1.0 billion, which was primarily driven by the decrease of the aetna national ppo plan from 4.5 stars to 3.5 stars. based on the increase in membership in 4+ star plans for payment year 2025, the company now expects to be eligible for bonus payments in 2025 that will recover the majority of the 2024 revenue decrease described above. the company expects to prudently reinvest a portion of this net improvement into its business.
(2)pharmacy network revenues relate to claims filled at retail and specialty retail pharmacies, including the company's retail pharmacies and ltc pharmacies. effective january 1, 2023, pharmacy network revenues also include activity associated with maintenance choice, which permits eligible client plan members to fill their maintenance prescriptions through mail order delivery or at a cvs pharmacy retail store for the same price as mail order. maintenance choice activity was previously reflected in mail & specialty revenues. segment financial information has been revised to reflect these changes.
(3)mail & specialty revenues relate to specialty mail claims inclusive of specialty connect® claims picked up at a retail pharmacy, as well as mail order and specialty claims fulfilled by the pharmacy & consumer wellness segment. effective january 1, 2023, mail & specialty revenues exclude maintenance choice activity, which is now reported within pharmacy network revenues. segment financial information has been revised to reflect these changes.
•total revenues increased $17.3 billion, or 10.2%, in 2023 compared to 2022. the increase was primarily driven by pharmacy drug mix, growth in specialty pharmacy, brand inflation and the acquisitions of oak street health and signify health. these increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy client price improvements.
•operating expenses increased $744 million, or 33.4%, in 2023 compared to 2022. the increase was primarily driven by operating expenses associated with oak street health and signify health, including the amortization of acquired intangible assets.
•operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to 1.6% in 2023 compared to 1.3% in 2022. the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to the increases in operating expenses associated with oak street health and signify health.
•the company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. in particular, competitive pressures in the pbm industry have caused the company and other pbms to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. in addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network "differential" or "spread," and the company expects these trends to continue. the "differential" or "spread" is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including medicare part d plan sponsors, by a pbm and the price paid for the drug by the pbm to the dispensing provider.
•pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through the company's pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either its retail network pharmacies or the company's mail and specialty pharmacies. management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. this metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.
•generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the health services segment's generic claims processed by its total claims processed. management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. this metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.
(3)same store sales and prescription volume represent the change in revenues and prescriptions filled in the company's retail pharmacy stores that have been operating for greater than one year, expressed as a percentage that indicates the increase or decrease relative to the comparable prior period. same store metrics exclude revenues and prescriptions from ltc and infusion services operations. effective january 1, 2023, same store sales also include digital sales initiated online or through mobile applications and fulfilled through the company's distribution centers. segment financial information has been revised to reflect these changes. management uses these metrics to evaluate the performance of existing stores on a comparable basis and to inform future decisions regarding existing stores and new locations. same-store metrics provide management and investors with information useful in understanding the portion of current revenues and prescriptions resulting from organic growth in existing locations versus the portion resulting from opening new stores.
•total revenues increased $8.2 billion, or 7.5%, in 2023 compared to 2022. the increase was primarily driven by pharmacy drug mix, increased prescription volume, brand inflation and increased contributions from vaccinations. these increases were partially offset by the impact of recent generic introductions, continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure, a decrease in store count and decreased contributions from covid-19 otc test kits and diagnostic testing.
•front store same store sales increased slightly in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily driven by increased beauty and personal care product sales, largely offset by decreased sales of covid-19 otc test kits and general merchandise.
•during 2023 and 2022, the company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million and $2.5 billion, respectively, related to the write-down of its ltc business. see note 2 ''acquisitions, divestitures and asset sales'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for additional information.
•operating expenses in the pharmacy & consumer wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.
•operating expenses decreased $863 million, or 4.2%, in 2023 compared to 2022. the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in store count, lower expenses associated with covid-19 vaccination administration compared to the prior year, gains from anti-trust legal settlements recorded in 2023 and a decrease in intangible asset amortization expense.
•the segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, pbms and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of business within the pharmacy portion of the pharmacy & consumer wellness segment. if the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.
•the increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted the segment's adjusted operating income but has resulted in third-party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. this trend, which the company expects to continue, reduces the benefit the segment realizes from brand-to-generic drug conversions.
•prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the pharmacy & consumer wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. this metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.

•total revenues decreased $79 million, or 14.9%, in 2023 compared to 2022. the decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in services revenues as well as a decline in net investment income, which decreased due to increased realized capital losses in 2023 compared to 2022, partially offset by favorable average investment yields in 2023 compared to 2022.
•during 2023, the company recorded $507 million in pre-tax restructuring charges, comprised of $344 million of severance and employee-related costs associated with corporate workforce optimization, $152 million of asset impairment charges and an $11 million stock-based compensation charge associated with the impacted employees. see note 3 ''restructuring program'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for additional information.

pursuant to the authorization under the 2021 repurchase program, the company entered into a $2.0 billion fixed dollar asr with citibank, n.a. upon payment of the $2.0 billion purchase price on january 4, 2023, the company received a number of shares of cvs health corporation's common stock equal to 80% of the $2.0 billion notional amount of the asr or approximately 17.4 million shares at a price of $92.19 per share, which were placed into treasury stock in january 2023. the asr was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for $1.6 billion and a forward contract for $0.4 billion. the forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus. in february 2023, the company received approximately 5.4 million shares of cvs health corporation's common stock, representing the remaining 20% of the $2.0 billion notional amount of the asr, thereby concluding the asr. these shares were placed into treasury and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock in february 2023.
pursuant to the authorization under the 2021 repurchase program, the company entered into a $1.5 billion fixed dollar asr with barclays bank plc. upon payment of the $1.5 billion purchase price on january 4, 2022, the company received a number of shares of cvs health corporation's common stock equal to 80% of the $1.5 billion notional amount of the asr or approximately 11.6 million shares at a price of $103.34 per share, which were placed into treasury stock in january 2022. the asr was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for $1.2 billion and a forward contract for $0.3 billion. the forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus. in february 2022, the company received approximately 2.7 million shares of cvs health corporation's common stock, representing the remaining 20% of the $1.5 billion notional amount of the asr, thereby concluding the asr. these shares were placed into treasury stock and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock in february 2022.
at the time they were received, the initial and final receipt of shares resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share.
dividends during 2023, 2022 and 2021 the quarterly cash dividend was $0.605, $0.55 and $0.50 per share, respectively. in december 2023, the board authorized an increase of approximately 10% in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.665 per share effective in 2024. cvs health corporation has paid cash dividends every quarter since becoming a public company. future dividend payments will depend on the company's earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the board.
future cash requirements the following table summarizes certain estimated future cash requirements under the company's various contractual obligations at december 31, 2023, in total and disaggregated into current and long-term obligations. the table below does not include future payments of claims to health care providers or pharmacies because certain terms of these payments are not determinable at december 31, 2023 (for example, the timing and volume of future services provided under fee-for-service arrangements and future membership levels for capitated arrangements).

(4)refer to note 18 ''commitments and contingencies'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for additional information regarding the opioid litigation settlement agreements.
(5)payments of other long-term liabilities exclude separate accounts liabilities of approximately $3.3 billion because these liabilities are supported by assets that are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of the company's business.
(6)total payments of future policy benefits, unpaid claims and policyholders' funds include $614 million, $1.1 billion and $152 million, respectively, of reserves for contracts subject to reinsurance. the company expects the assuming reinsurance carrier to fund these obligations and has reflected these amounts as reinsurance recoverable assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
(7)customer funds associated with group life and health contracts of approximately $58 million have been excluded from the table above because such funds may be used primarily at the customer's discretion to offset future premiums and/or for refunds, and the timing of the related cash flows cannot be determined. additionally, net unrealized capital losses on debt securities supporting experience-rated products of $18 million, before tax, have been excluded from the table above.
restrictions on certain payments in addition to general state law restrictions on payments of dividends and other distributions to stockholders applicable to all corporations, health maintenance organizations ("hmos") and insurance companies are subject to further regulations that, among other things, may require those companies to maintain certain levels of equity (referred to as surplus) and restrict the amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their equity holders. these regulations are not directly applicable to cvs health corporation as a holding company, since cvs health corporation is not an hmo or an insurance company. in addition, in connection with the aetna acquisition, the company made certain undertakings that require prior regulatory approval of dividends by certain of its hmos and insurance companies. the additional regulations and undertakings applicable to the company's hmo and insurance company subsidiaries are not expected to affect the company's ability to service the company's debt, meet other financing obligations or pay dividends, or the ability of any of the company's subsidiaries to service their debt or other financing obligations. under applicable regulatory requirements and undertakings, at december 31, 2023, the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid by the company's insurance and hmo subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities was $3.1 billion in the aggregate.
the company maintains capital levels in its operating subsidiaries at or above targeted and/or required capital levels and dividends amounts in excess of these levels to meet liquidity requirements, including the payment of interest on debt and stockholder dividends. in addition, at the company's discretion, it uses these funds for other purposes such as funding share and debt repurchase programs, investments in new businesses and other purposes considered advisable.
at december 31, 2023 and 2022, the company held investments of $307 million and $331 million, respectively, that are not accounted for as separate accounts assets but are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of the company's business. see note 4 ''investments'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for additional information on investments related to the 2012 conversion of an existing group annuity contract from a participating to a non-participating contract.
solvency regulation the national association of insurance commissioners (the "naic") utilizes risk-based capital ("rbc") standards for insurance companies that are designed to identify weakly-capitalized companies by comparing each company's adjusted surplus to its required surplus (the "rbc ratio"). the rbc ratio is designed to reflect the risk profile of insurance companies. within certain ratio ranges, regulators have increasing authority to take action as the rbc ratio decreases. there are four levels of regulatory action, ranging from requiring an insurer to submit a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its rbc to the state insurance commissioner to requiring the state insurance commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control. at december 31, 2023, all of the company's insurance and hmo subsidiaries were either above the rbc level that would require regulatory action or otherwise subject to an agreement to avoid any regulatory action. the rbc framework described above for insurers has been extended by the naic to health organizations, including hmos. although not all states had adopted these rules at december 31, 2023, at that date each of the company's active hmos had a surplus that exceeded either the applicable state net worth requirements or, where adopted, the levels that would require regulatory action under the naic's rbc rules, or were otherwise subject to an agreement to avoid any regulatory action. external rating agencies use their own capital models and/or rbc standards when they determine a company's rating.
critical accounting policies the company prepares the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make certain estimates and apply judgment. estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. on a regular basis, the company reviews its accounting policies and how they are applied and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. while the company believes the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered by management support the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results could differ from estimates, and such differences could be material.
significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 ''significant accounting policies'' included in item 8 of this 10-k. management believes the following accounting policies include a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity and, thus, are considered to be critical accounting policies. the company has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board (the "audit committee"), and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures relating to them.
revenue recognition health care benefits segment health care benefits revenue is principally derived from insurance premiums and fees billed to customers. revenue related to the company's government business is collected monthly from the u.s. federal government and various government agencies based on fixed payment rates and member eligibility.
health services segment the health services segment sells prescription drugs directly through its specialty and mail order pharmacy offerings and indirectly through the company's retail pharmacy network. the company's pharmacy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are no contractual minimum volumes and each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in time. pbm services performed in connection with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the fulfillment of prescription drugs.
the company recognizes revenue using the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the company has concluded it controls the prescription drug before it is transferred to the client plan members. the company controls prescriptions fulfilled indirectly through its retail pharmacy network because it has separate contractual arrangements with those pharmacies, has discretion in setting the price for the transaction and assumes primary responsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide prescription drugs to its client plan members while also performing the related pbm services.
the company recognizes revenue when control of the prescription drugs is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those prescription drugs. the company has established the following revenue recognition policies for the health services segment:
•revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the company's retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees are recognized at the company's point-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the company's online claims processing system and the company has transferred control of the prescription drug and completed all of its performance obligations.
•revenues generated from prescription drugs sold by specialty and mail order pharmacies are recognized when the prescription drug is delivered to the client plan member. at the time of delivery, the company has performed substantially all of its performance obligations under its client contracts and does not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.
drug discounts the company records revenue net of manufacturers' rebates earned by its clients based on their plan members' utilization of brand-name formulary drugs. the company estimates these rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers' rebates earned by its clients. the estimates are based on the best available data at period-end and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client. the company adjusts its rebates payable to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur. any cumulative effect of these adjustments is recorded against revenues at the time it is identified. adjustments generally result from contract changes with clients or manufacturers that have retroactive rebate adjustments, differences between the estimated and actual product mix subject to rebates, or whether the brand name drug was included in the applicable formulary. the effect of adjustments between estimated and actual manufacturers' rebate amounts has not been material to the company's operating results or financial condition.
impairments of debt securities the company regularly reviews its debt securities to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred. if a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the company will have to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized in net income. if a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the company will not have to sell such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit related (yield-related) components. the amount of the credit-related component is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the amount of the non-credit related component is included in other comprehensive income (loss). the company analyzes all facts and circumstances believed to be relevant for each investment when performing this analysis, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.
in evaluating whether a credit related loss exists, the company considers a variety of factors including: the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis; adverse conditions specifically related to the issuer of a security, an industry or geographic area; the payment structure of the security; the failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principle payments; and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency.
among the factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred are whether the decline results from a change in the quality of the debt security itself, whether the decline results from a downward movement in the market as a whole, and the prospects for realizing the carrying value of the debt security based on the investment's current and short-term prospects for recovery. for unrealized losses determined to be the result of market conditions (for example, increasing interest rates and volatility due to conditions in the overall market) or industry-related events, the company determines whether it intends to sell the debt security or if it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the debt security prior to the anticipated recovery of the debt security's amortized cost basis. if either case is true, the company recognizes a non-credit related impairment, and the cost basis or carrying amount of the debt security is written down to fair value.
during the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the company recorded yield-related impairment losses on debt securities of $152 million, $143 million and $42 million, respectively. during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 the company recorded credit-related losses on debt securities of $3 million and $13 million, respectively. during the year ended december 31, 2021, the company did not record any credit-related impairment losses on debt securities.
the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of a debt security include the risk that market factors may differ from projections and the risk that facts and circumstances factored into the company's assessment may change with the passage of time. unexpected changes to market factors and circumstances that were not present in past reporting periods are among the factors that may result in a current period decision to sell debt securities that were not impaired in prior reporting periods.
the value of ending inventory is reduced for estimated inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis in each retail store and pharmacy, and a continuous cycle count process is the primary procedure used to validate the inventory balances on hand in each distribution center and mail facility to ensure that the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements are properly stated. the company's accounting for inventory contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. when estimating these losses, a number of factors are considered which include historical physical inventory results on a location-by-location basis and current physical inventory loss trends.
the total reserve for estimated inventory losses covered by this critical accounting policy was $607 million and $559 million as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. although management believes there is sufficient current and historical information available to record reasonable estimates for estimated inventory losses, it is possible that actual results could differ. in order to help investors assess the aggregate risk, if any, associated with the inventory-related uncertainties discussed above, a ten percent (10%) pre-tax change in estimated inventory losses, which is a reasonably likely change, would increase or decrease the total reserve for estimated inventory losses by approximately $61 million as of december 31, 2023.
recoverability of long-lived assets recoverability of definite-lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are tested for impairment using separate tests described below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. the company groups and evaluates these long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. if indicators of impairment are present, the company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). if the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group's estimated future cash flows (discounted). if required, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group's carrying value that exceeds the asset group's estimated future cash flows (discounted).
the long-lived asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate each asset group's future sales, profitability and cash flows. when preparing these estimates, the company considers historical results and current operating trends and consolidated sales, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts. these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic and regulatory conditions, efforts of third party organizations to reduce their prescription drug costs and/or increased member co-payments, the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns.
during the fourth quarter of 2022, the company undertook an initiative to evaluate its corporate office real estate space in response to its new flexible work arrangement. as part of this initiative, the company evaluated its current real estate space and changes in employee work arrangement requirements to ensure it had the appropriate space to support the business. as a result of this assessment, the company determined that it would vacate and abandon certain leased corporate office spaces. accordingly, in the three months ended december 31, 2022, the company recorded office real estate optimization charges of $117 million, primarily consisting of $71 million related to operating lease right-of-use assets and $44 million related to property and equipment. during the year ended december 31, 2023, the company recorded an incremental $46 million of office real estate optimization charges associated with this initiative, primarily consisting of $20 million related to operating lease right-of-use assets and $18 million related to property and equipment. the office real estate optimization charges were recorded within the health care benefits, corporate/other and health services segments.
during the fourth quarter of 2021, the company completed a strategic review of its retail business and announced the creation of new formats for its stores to continue to drive higher engagement with customers. as part of this review, the company evaluated changes in population, consumer buying patterns and future health needs to ensure it has the right kinds of stores in the right locations for consumers and for the business. in connection with this initiative, on november 17, 2021, the board authorized the closing of approximately 900 retail stores, approximately 300 stores each year, between 2022 and 2024. as a result, management determined that there were indicators of impairment with respect to the impacted stores' asset groups, including the associated operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment. a long-lived asset impairment test was performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 and the results of the impairment test indicated that the fair value of certain retail store asset groups was lower than their respective carrying values. accordingly, in the three months ended december 31, 2021, the company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion, consisting of a write down of approximately $1.1 billion related to operating lease right-of-use assets and $261 million related to property and equipment, within the pharmacy & consumer wellness segment.
recoverability of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquisitions over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment on a reporting unit basis. the impairment test is performed by comparing the reporting unit's fair value with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. the fair value of the reporting units is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. if the net book value (carrying amount) of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the reporting unit's goodwill is considered to be impaired, and an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates. these assumptions and estimates primarily include the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums and valuation multiples appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the company competes; discount rates; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, income taxes, capital expenditures and future working capital requirements. when determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates, the company considers each reporting unit's historical results and current operating trends; consolidated revenues, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts; and industry trends. the company's estimates can be affected by a number of factors, including general economic and regulatory conditions; the risk-free interest rate environment; the company's market capitalization; efforts of customers and payers to reduce costs, including their prescription drug costs, and/or increase member co-payments; the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share, consumer spending patterns and the company's ability to achieve its revenue growth projections and execute on its cost reduction initiatives.
effective for the 2023 annual goodwill impairment test, the company elected to change its annual goodwill impairment test date from august 31st to october 31st to better align with its annual budgeting processes, as its previous election predated large acquisitions such as caremark rx, inc. and aetna.
2023 goodwill impairment test prior to the company's 2023 goodwill impairment test, the most recent goodwill impairment test was performed as of january 1, 2023, in connection with the segment realignment previously described in note 1 ''significant accounting policies''. during the fourth quarter of 2023, the company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill. the results of the impairment tests indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date. the fair values of the reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying values by significant margins, with the exception of the health care delivery reporting unit, which exceeded its carrying value by approximately 9%.
in connection with its new operating model adopted in the first quarter of 2023, the company formed a new health care delivery reporting unit within the health services segment. the health care delivery reporting unit is primarily comprised of the signify health and oak street health care delivery assets, which were acquired on march 29, 2023 and may 2, 2023, respectively. these transactions were accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their fair values at the date of acquisition. given the close proximity of the acquisition dates to the 2023 annual impairment test of goodwill, as expected, the fair value of these two businesses and, therefore, of the health care delivery reporting unit, remained relatively in line with the carrying value of the reporting unit. this fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions including the revenue growth rate, operating income and the discount rate.
2022 goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2022, the company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill. the results of the impairment tests indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date. the fair values of the reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying values by significant margins.
2021 goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2021, the company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill. the results of the impairment tests indicated an impairment of the goodwill associated with the ltc reporting unit, as the reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value as of the testing date. the results of the impairment tests of the remaining reporting units indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date. the fair values of the reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying values by significant margins, with the exception of the commercial business reporting unit, which exceeded its carrying value by approximately 3%.
as discussed in note 6 ''goodwill and other intangibles'' included in item 8 of this 10-k, during 2021, the ltc reporting unit continued to face challenges that impacted the company's ability to grow the ltc reporting unit's business at the rate estimated when its 2020 goodwill impairment test was performed. these challenges included lower net facility admissions, net long-term care facility customer losses and the prolonged adverse impact of the covid-19 pandemic and the emerging new variants, which resulted in more significant declines in occupancy rates experienced by the company's long-term care facility customers than previously anticipated. during the third quarter of 2021, ltc management updated their 2021 annual forecast and submitted their long-term plan which showed deterioration in the financial results for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. the company utilized these updated projections in performing its annual impairment test, which indicated that the fair value of the ltc reporting unit was lower than its carrying value, resulting in a $431 million goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2021. the fair value of the ltc reporting unit was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. subsequent to the impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 2021, there was no remaining goodwill balance in the ltc reporting unit.
recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate fair value based on the assumption that, in lieu of ownership of an intangible asset, the company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to utilize the benefits of the asset. fair value is estimated by discounting the hypothetical royalty payments to their present value over the estimated economic life of the asset. these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions, availability of market information and the profitability of the company. there were no impairment losses recognized on indefinite-lived intangible assets in any of the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021.
health care benefits' ibnr liabilities the health care benefits segment's health care costs payable include estimates of the ultimate cost of (i) services rendered to the segment's insured members but not yet reported to the company and (ii) claims which have been reported to the company but not yet paid (collectively, "ibnr"). health care costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement date if the company is obligated to pay for such services in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements. ibnr estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider numerous factors. see note 1 ''significant accounting policies'' included in item 8 of this 10-k for additional information on the company's reserving methodology.
during 2023 and 2022, the segment observed an increase in completion factors relative to those assumed at the prior year end. after considering the claims paid in 2023 and 2022 with dates of service prior to the fourth quarter of the previous year, the segment observed assumed incurred claim weighted average completion factors that were 4 and 3 basis points higher, respectively, than previously estimated, resulting in a decrease of $55 million and $32 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, in health care costs payable that related to the prior year. the segment has considered the pattern of changes in its completion factors when determining the completion factors used in its estimates of ibnr as of december 31, 2023. however, based on historical claim experience, it is reasonably possible that the estimated weighted average completion factors may vary by plus or minus 9 basis points from the assumed rates, which could impact health care costs payable by approximately plus or minus $166 million pretax.
also, during 2023 and 2022, the health care benefits segment observed that health care costs for claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less before the financial statement date were lower than previously estimated. specifically, after considering the claims paid in 2023 and 2022 with claim incurred dates for the fourth quarter of the previous year, the segment observed health care costs that were 4.5% and 4.8% lower, respectively, for each fourth quarter than previously estimated, resulting in a reduction of $620 million and $622 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, in health care costs payable that related to prior year.
management considers historical health care cost trend rates together with its knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends when developing estimates of current health care cost trend rates. when establishing reserves as of december 31, 2023, the segment increased its assumed health care cost trend rates for the most recent three months by 7.1% from health care cost trend rates recently observed. health care cost trend rates during the past three years have been impacted by utilization changes driven by the covid-19 pandemic. the impact has not been uniform, with products and select geographies experiencing utilization impacts due to covid-19 waves. based on historical claim experience, it is reasonably possible that the segment's estimated health care cost trend rates may vary by plus or minus 3.5% from the assumed rates, which could impact health care costs payable by plus or minus $595 million pretax.

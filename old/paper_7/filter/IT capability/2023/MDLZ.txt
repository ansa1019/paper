item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. it should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10-k, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in forward-looking statements and item 1a, risk factors.
overview of business and strategy our core business is making and selling chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks, with additional businesses in adjacent, locally relevant categories including gum & candy, cheese & grocery and powdered beverages around the world.
we aim to be the global leader in snacking. our strategy is to drive long-term growth by focusing on four strategic priorities: accelerating consumer-centric growth, driving operational excellence, creating a winning growth culture and scaling sustainable snacking. we believe the successful implementation of our strategic priorities and leveraging of our attractive global footprint, strong core of iconic global and local brands, marketing, sales, distribution and cost excellence capabilities, and top talent with a growth mindset, will drive consistent top- and bottom-line growth, enabling us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders.
for more detailed information on our business and strategy, refer to item 1, business.
recent developments and significant items affecting comparability macroeconomic environment we continue to observe significant market and geopolitical uncertainty, inflationary pressures, supply constraints and exchange rate volatility. as a result, we experienced significantly higher operating costs, including higher overall raw material, labor and energy costs that have continued to rise. our overall outlook for future snacks revenue growth remains strong; however, we anticipate ongoing volatility. we will continue to proactively manage our business in response to the evolving global economic environment, related uncertainty and business risks while also prioritizing and supporting our employees and customers. we continue to take steps to mitigate impacts to our supply chain, operations, technology and assets.
war in ukraine in february 2022, following the russian military invasion of ukraine, we stopped production and closed our facilities in ukraine; since then we have taken steps to protect the safety of our employees and to restore operations at our two manufacturing facilities, which were significantly damaged in march 2022. we continue to support our ukraine employees, including paying salaries to those not yet able to return to work until full production returns. see note 1, summary of significant accounting policies - war in ukraine, to the consolidated financial statements and refer to items affecting comparability of financial results for additional information.
we have suspended new capital investments and our advertising spending in russia, but as a food company with more than 2,500 employees in the country, we have not ceased operations given we believe we play a role in the continuity of the food supply. we continue to evaluate the situation in ukraine and russia and our ability to control our operating activities and businesses on an ongoing basis and comply with applicable international sanctions, and we continue to consolidate both our ukrainian and russian subsidiaries. during 2023, ukraine generated 0.4% and russia generated 2.9% of consolidated net revenue and during 2022, ukraine generated 0.3% and russia generated 4.0% of consolidated net revenue. our russian net revenues declined in 2023 due to continued suspension of advertising as well as currency weakness. despite the decrease in revenues, the profitability of our russian business in 2023 remained above historical levels. we cannot predict if the recent strength in our russian business will continue in the future.
our operations in russia are subject to risks, including the temporary or permanent loss of assets or our ability to conduct business operations in russia and the partial or full impairment of our russian assets in future periods, or the termination of our business operations, based on actions taken by russia, other parties or us. for more information, see item 1a, risk factors, including the risk entitled "the war in ukraine has impacted and could continue to impact our business operations, financial performance and results of operations."
developments in the middle east in october 2023, conflict developed in the middle east between hamas and israel, and conflict has expanded throughout the region. in the fourth quarter of 2023, we experienced minor sales impact related to this conflict in certain amea markets, but this did not have a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. we continue to evaluate the impacts of these developments on our business and we cannot predict if it will have a significant impact in the future.
acquisitions and divestitures during 2022, we completed the following acquisitions to strategically complement and expand our existing portfolio:
•ricolino, a confectionery business with products sold primarily in mexico
•clif bar & company ("clif bar"), a leading u.s. maker of nutritious energy bars with organic ingredients
•chipita global s.a. ("chipita"), a high-growth leader in the central and eastern european croissant and baked snacks category additionally in 2022, we announced our intention to divest our developed market gum and global halls candy businesses and in the fourth quarter of 2022, we announced an agreement to sell the developed market gum business. on october 1, 2023, we completed the sale of our developed market gum business to perfetti van melle group, excluding the portugal business which we retained pending regulatory approval. after obtaining the regulatory approval, we completed the sale of the portugal business to perfetti van melle group on october 23, 2023.
refer to note 2, acquisitions and divestitures, and liquidity and capital resources for additional details.
in 2023, we sold approximately 9.9 million of our shares, which reduced our ownership interest by 2.0 percentage points, from 19.7% to 17.7%. we recorded a loss of €21 million ($23 million). in 2022, we sold approximately 18.6 million of our shares back to jdep, which reduced our ownership interest by approximately 3.0 percentage points. we recorded a loss of €8 million ($8 million). in 2021, we issued €300 million exchangeable bonds. if all bonds were redeemed in exchange for shares, this would represent approximately 8.5 million shares or approximately 10% of our equity interest in jdep.
in 2023, we sold the remainder of our shares in kdp, representing approximately 76 million shares. our reduction in ownership to below 5% eliminated our significant influence over kdp, resulting in a change in accounting from equity method investment accounting to accounting for equity interests with readily determinable fair values in the first quarter of 2023. prior to this change, we recorded a pre-tax gain on equity method transactions of $493 million ($368 million after-tax)- in 2023. after the change in accounting, we recorded pre-tax gains for marketable securities of $606 million in 2023. in 2021, we sold approximately 42.7 million shares in kdp, which reduced our ownership interest by 3.0 percentage points to 5.3%. we recorded a pre-tax gain of $768 million (or $581 million after-tax).
for additional information, refer to note 7, investments and note 10, financial instruments.
taxes we continue to monitor existing and potential future tax reform around the world. as of december 31, 2023, numerous countries have now enacted the organization of economic cooperation and development's model rules on a global minimum tax, with the earliest effective date being for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2023. based on the guidance available thus far, we do not expect this legislation to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements but we will continue to evaluate it as additional guidance and clarification becomes available.
financial outlook we seek to achieve profitable, long-term growth and manage our business to attain this goal using our key operating metrics: organic net revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted eps. we use these non-gaap financial metrics and related computations, particularly growth in profit dollars, to evaluate and manage our business and to plan and make near- and long-term operating and strategic decisions. as such, we believe these metrics are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap") financial results. we believe it is useful to provide investors with the same financial information that we use internally to make comparisons of our historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and evaluate our business. we believe our non-gaap financial measures should always be considered in relation to our gaap results. refer to non-gaap financial measures for the definitions of our non-gaap financial measures and consolidated results of operations for the respective reconciliations.
in addition to monitoring our key operating metrics, we monitor a number of developments and trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives:
demand we monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products. core snacks categories continued to expand due to the continued growth of snacking as a consumer behavior around the world. as part of our strategic plan, we seek to drive category growth by leveraging our local and consumer-focused commercial approach, making investments in our brand and snacks portfolio, building strong routes to market in both emerging and developed markets and improving our availability across multiple channels. we believe these actions will help drive demand in our categories and strengthen our positions across markets.
long-term demographics and consumer trends snack food consumption is highly correlated to gdp growth, urbanization of populations and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class, particularly in emerging markets. we believe that snacks continue to be a source of comfort as well as excitement and variety for consumers. social media increasingly helps consumers find food trends, inspiration and connection on their social media and other feeds. consumers are also interested in buying snacks conveniently, whether through same-day delivery platforms, shipped sources or different retail settings. many consumers also continue to prioritize sustainability in their purchase decisions, valuing sustainably sourced ingredients, low carbon footprint preparation and lower waste packaging. we seek to continue to offer snacks that meet consumer needs and preferences and align with our strategic priorities.
pricing our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions, such as increasing input and operating costs due to supply, transportation and labor constraints and higher cost trends. we adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including market factors, transportation, logistics and changes in our product input costs, and we have increased prices to control costs given significant cost inflation.
operating costs our operating costs include raw materials, labor, selling, general and administrative expenses, taxes, currency impacts and financing costs. we manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives, sourcing and hedging programs, pricing actions, refinancing and tax planning. to remain competitive on our operating structure, we continue to work on programs to expand our profitability, such as our simplify to grow program, which is designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. we experienced significantly higher operating costs, including higher overall raw material and labor costs that have continued to rise.
-net revenues increased in 2023, driven by higher net pricing, incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of clif bar and ricolino in 2022, favorable volume/mix and incremental net revenue from a short-term distributor agreement related to the sale of our developed market gum business, partially offset by a significant impact from unfavorable currency translation, as the u.s. dollar strengthened relative to most currencies we operate in compared to exchange rates in the prior year, and the impact of our developed market gum divestiture in 2023.
-net revenues increased in 2022, driven by higher net pricing, incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of chipita, clif bar and ricolino in 2022 and gourmet foods and grenade in 2021 and favorable volume/mix, partially offset by a significant impact from unfavorable currency translation, as the u.s. dollar strengthened relative to most currencies we operate in compared to exchange rates in the prior year, and a decline in our developed market gum business, divested in 2023, and the impact from our divestitures in 2022.
•organic net revenue, a non-gaap financial measure, increased 14.7% to $35.6 billion in 2023 and increased 12.3% to $31.7 billion in 2022. organic net revenue increased in both 2023 and 2022 due to higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. organic net revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from acquisitions and divestitures. refer to non-gaap financial measures for the definition of organic net revenue and consolidated results of operations for our reconciliation with net revenues.
-diluted eps increased in 2023 driven by an increase in adjusted eps, a gain on marketable securities, favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, higher net gain on equity method investment transactions, lower impact from the european commission legal matter, lapping prior year acquisition-related costs, lapping prior year incremental costs due to the war in ukraine, a gain on divestiture, lapping prior year loss on debt extinguishment, lower intangible asset impairment charges and lapping prior year inventory step-up charges. these favorable items were partially offset by higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, higher equity method investee items, higher negative initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, higher remeasurement loss of net monetary position, lower operating results from divestitures, higher divestiture-related costs, lapping prior year 2017 malware incident net recoveries and higher simplify to grow program costs.
-diluted eps decreased in 2022 driven by lapping prior year net gains on equity method transactions, unfavorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, the impact from the european commission legal matter, higher acquisition-related costs, incremental costs incurred due to the war in ukraine, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, higher intangible asset impairment charges, higher remeasurement loss of net monetary position, inventory step-up charges incurred in 2022 and lower net earnings from divestitures, partially offset by lower simplify to grow program costs, an increase in adjusted eps, lower negative impacts from enacted tax law changes, lower equity method investee items, 2017 malware incident net recoveries and lower negative impact from pension participation changes.
-adjusted eps, a non-gaap financial measure, increased 14.3% to $3.19 in 2023 and increased 3.3% to $2.79 in 2022. on a constant currency basis, adjusted eps increased 19.0% to $3.32 in 2023 and increased 11.9% to $3.02 in 2022. refer to non-gaap financial measures for the definition of adjusted eps and consolidated results of operations for our reconciliation with diluted eps.
-adjusted eps increased in 2023, driven by operating gains, impact from acquisitions, lower interest expense, fewer shares outstanding and dividend income from marketable securities, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, higher taxes and lower benefit plan non-service income.
-adjusted eps increased in 2022, driven by operating gains and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, higher interest expense and lower equity method investment earnings.

net revenue increase of 14.4% was driven by our underlying organic net revenue growth of 14.7%, the impact of acquisitions and the impact of a short-term distributor agreement, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation and the impact of divestitures. overall, we continued to see strong demand for our snack category products across most regions. organic net revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. higher net pricing in all regions was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2022 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2023. favorable volume/mix was driven by amea, latin america and europe reflecting both improved product mix and volume gains, while volume/mix was essentially flat in north america. the november 1, 2022 acquisition of ricolino added incremental net revenues of $507 million (constant currency basis) through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. the august 1, 2022 acquisition of clif bar added incremental net revenues of $529 million through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition. the short-term distributor agreement related to the october 1, 2023 sale of our developed market gum business added incremental net revenues of $22 million. unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $1,096 million, due primarily to the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to several currencies, primarily due to the argentinean peso and russian ruble as well as the turkish lira, egyptian pound, indian rupee, chinese yuan, nigerian naira, australian dollar, south african rand, pakistan rupee and canadian dollar, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, including the mexican peso, euro, brazilian real, polish zloty and british pound sterling. the impact of 2023 and 2022 divestitures resulted in a year-over-year reduction in net revenues of $14 million. refer to note 2, acquisitions and divestitures, for additional information.

during 2023, we realized higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix, which was partially offset by increased input costs. higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2022 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2023, was reflected across all regions. overall, volume/mix benefited from improved product mix and continued strong demand for our snack category products across most regions. favorable volume/mix was driven by amea, latin america and europe, which was marginally offset by slightly unfavorable volume/mix in north america. the increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, slightly offset by lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity. higher raw material costs were in part due to higher energy, sugar, grains, dairy, cocoa, packaging, edible oils and other ingredients costs as well as unfavorable year-over-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials.
total selling, general and administrative expenses increased $618 million from 2022, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, the impact of acquisitions, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, higher divestiture-related costs, higher remeasurement loss of net monetary position and lapping prior-year 2017 malware incident net recoveries, which were offset by a lower impact from the european commission legal matter, lapping prior year acquisition-related costs, a favorable currency impact related to expenses, lower implementation costs incurred for the simplify to grow program, the impact from divestitures and lower incremental costs due to the war in ukraine. excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $947 million from 2022. the increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher overhead costs in part due to increased investments in route to market capabilities.
operating income margin increased from 11.2% in 2022 to 15.3% in 2023. the increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by the favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and commodity hedging activities, lapping prior year acquisition-related costs, lower impact from the european commission legal matter, lower incremental costs due to the war in ukraine, gain on the sale of our developed market gum business, lower intangible asset impairment charges, higher adjusted operating income margin and lapping prior year inventory step-up charges, partially offset by higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, higher divestiture-related costs, higher remeasurement loss of net monetary position and lapping prior year 2017 malware incident net recoveries. adjusted operating income margin increased from 15.8% in 2022 to 15.9% in 2023. the increase was driven primarily by higher net pricing, overhead cost leverage, lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and favorable product mix, partially offset by higher raw material costs and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs.

net revenue increase of 9.7% was driven by our underlying organic net revenue growth of 12.3% and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation and the impact of divestitures. overall, we continued to see increased demand for our snack category products. organic net revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. higher net pricing in all regions was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2021 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2022. favorable volume/mix was driven by amea, latin america and north america, primarily due to strong volume gains across our snack category products, while volume/mix was essentially flat in europe. the november 1, 2022 acquisition of ricolino added incremental net revenues of $98 million (constant currency basis), the august 1, 2022 acquisition of clif bar added incremental net revenues of $361 million, the january 3, 2022 acquisition of chipita added incremental net revenues of $720 million (constant currency basis), the april 1, 2021 acquisition of gourmet food added incremental net revenues of $15 million (constant currency basis) through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition in 2022 and the march 25, 2021 acquisition of grenade added incremental net revenues of $22 million (constant currency basis) through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition in 2022. unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $1,905 million, primarily due to the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to most currencies, including the euro, british pound sterling, argentinean peso, turkish lira, australian dollar, indian rupee, polish zloty, chinese yuan and swedish krona, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, primarily the russian ruble, brazilian real and mexican peso. the impact of divestitures resulted in a year-over-year reduction in net revenues of $35 million. refer to note 2, acquisitions and divestitures, for more information.

during 2022, we realized higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix, which was largely offset by increased input costs. higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2021 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2022, was reflected in all regions. overall, volume/mix benefited from strong volume growth due to continued increased demand for our snack category products. favorable volume/mix was driven by amea and latin america, which was slightly offset by unfavorable volume/mix in north america and europe. the increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs as well as higher manufacturing costs. higher raw material costs were in part due to higher dairy, packaging, edible oils, energy, grains, sugar, nuts and other ingredients costs as well as unfavorable year-over-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower cocoa costs.
total selling, general and administrative expenses increased $1,121 million from 2021, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, the impact from the european commission legal matter, the impact of acquisitions, higher acquisition-related costs, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, higher remeasurement loss of net monetary position, higher divestiture-related costs, incremental costs due to the war in ukraine and lapping the prior year favorable impact from the resolution of a tax matter, which were partially offset by a favorable currency impact related to expenses, lapping the prior year unfavorable impact from pension participation changes, 2017 malware incident net recoveries, lower implementation costs incurred for the simplify to grow program and the impact from divestitures. excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $478 million from 2021. the increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher overheads, in part due to increased investments in route to market capabilities.
unfavorable currency changes decreased operating income by $312 million, primarily due to the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to most currencies, including the euro, british pound sterling, turkish lira, australian dollar, indian rupee, polish zloty, egyptian pound and chinese yuan, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, including the russian ruble and brazilian real.
operating income margin decreased from 16.2% in 2021 to 11.2% in 2022. the decrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by the year-over-year unfavorable change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and commodity hedging activities, the impact from the european commission legal matter, higher acquisition-related costs, lower adjusted operating income margin, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, incremental costs due to the war in ukraine, higher intangible asset impairment charges, higher remeasurement of net monetary position and inventory step-up charges incurred in 2022, partially offset by lower costs for the simplify to grow program, lapping the prior year unfavorable impact from pension participation changes, the impact of 2017 malware incident net recoveries and the impact of divestitures. adjusted operating income margin decreased from 16.5% in 2021 to 15.8% in 2022. the decrease was driven primarily by higher raw material costs, unfavorable product mix and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by higher net pricing and overhead cost leverage.

net revenues increased $302 million (4.7%), due to favorable volume/mix (7.4 pp), higher net pricing (5.1 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (0.3 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (7.6 pp) and the impact of a divestiture (0.5 pp). favorable volume/mix reflected overall volume gains from increased demand for our snack category products. favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in biscuits & baked snacks, chocolate, refreshment beverages and candy, partially offset by declines in gum and cheese & grocery. higher net pricing was reflected across all categories. the april 1, 2021 acquisition of gourmet food added incremental net revenues of $15 million (constant currency basis) through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition in 2022. unfavorable currency impacts were due to the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the australian dollar, indian rupee, chinese yuan, philippine peso, egyptian pound, south african rand, and japanese yen. the impact of the november 1, 2021 divestiture of the packaged seafood business, which was part of our april 1, 2021 acquisition of gourmet food, resulted in a year-over-year reduction in net revenues of $35 million.
segment operating income decreased $125 million (11.9%), primarily due to higher raw material costs, intangible asset impairment charges incurred in 2022, unfavorable currency, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses, higher costs incurred for the simplify to grow program, higher fixed asset impairment charges and the impact of a divestiture. these unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, favorable volume/mix and lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity.
2023 compared with 2022
net revenues increased $1,437 million (12.6%), due to higher net pricing (13.8 pp), favorable volume/mix (0.7 pp) and the impact from short-term distributor agreements (0.2 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (1.9 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.2 pp). higher net pricing, driven by input cost-driven pricing actions, was reflected across all categories. overall, volume/mix was favorable driven by improved product mix. favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in biscuits & baked snacks, chocolate, gum and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in cheese & grocery and candy. the short-term distributor agreement related to the october 1, 2023 sale of our developed market gum business added incremental net revenues of $22 million. unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to several currencies across the region, including the russian ruble, turkish lira, norwegian krone, ukrainian hryvnya and swedish krona, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, including the euro, polish zloty, british pound sterling and swiss franc. the impact of divestitures reflected a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $4 million from our 2023 divested developed market gum business.
segment operating income increased $497 million (33.6%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower impact from the european commission legal matter, lapping the prior year incremental costs incurred due to the war in ukraine, lower acquisition integration costs and favorable volume/mix. these favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, unfavorable currency, divestiture-related costs incurred in 2023, higher costs incurred for the simplify to grow program, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses, higher remeasurement loss on net monetary position, higher manufacturing costs and an intangible asset impairment charge incurred in 2023.
2022 compared with 2021
net revenues increased $264 million (2.4%), higher net pricing (7.4 pp) and the impact of acquisitions (6.4 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (11.3 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.1 pp). higher net pricing was reflected across all categories. the january 3, 2022 acquisition of chipita added incremental net revenues of $685 million (constant currency basis) and the march 25, 2021 acquisition of grenade added incremental net revenues of $22 million (constant currency basis) through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition in 2022. overall, volume/mix was slightly unfavorable as declines in biscuits & baked snacks and cheese & grocery were mostly offset by gains in candy, gum, chocolate and refreshment beverages. unfavorable currency impacts reflected the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to most currencies across the region, including the euro, british pound sterling, turkish lira, polish zloty, swedish krona and romanian leu, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, primarily the russian ruble.
segment operating income decreased $611 million (29.2%), primarily due to higher raw material costs, the impact from the european commission legal matter, unfavorable currency, incremental costs incurred due to the war in ukraine, higher acquisition integration costs, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, unfavorable volume/mix and fixed asset impairment charges incurred in 2022. these unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lapping the prior year unfavorable impact of pension participation changes, the impact of acquisitions and the impact of divestitures.
2023 compared with 2022
net revenues increased $1,398 million (14.4%), due to higher net pricing (9.5 pp), the impact of an acquisition (5.6 pp) and flat volume/mix (- pp), partially offset by the impact of divestitures (0.4 pp) and unfavorable currency (0.3 pp). higher net pricing, driven by input cost-driven pricing actions, was reflected across all categories. the august 1, 2022 acquisition of clif bar added incremental net revenues of $529 million through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition in 2023. overall, volume/mix was flat as slight volume gains were offset by unfavorable mix. flat volume/mix was driven by gains in candy and chocolate offset by a decline in biscuits & baked snacks. while the impact of divestitures reflected a year-over-year increase in net revenues of $12 million (net of the loss of revenue for the fourth quarter) from our 2023 divested developed market gum business, it had a negative impact on the net revenue growth rate as the divested business did not grow as fast as the remaining segment. unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to the canadian dollar.
segment operating income increased $323 million (18.3%), primarily due to higher net pricing, the impact of our clif bar acquisition, higher operating results from the divested developed market gum business, lower costs incurred for the simplify to grow program and lapping prior year inventory step-up charges. these favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses, an intangible asset impairment charge incurred in 2023, divestiture-related costs incurred in 2023, unfavorable volume/mix and unfavorable currency.
2022 compared with 2021
net revenues increased $1,378 million (16.6%), due to higher net pricing (11.8 pp), the impact of acquisitions (4.9 pp) and favorable volume/mix (0.6 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (0.4 pp) and the impact of divestitures (0.3 pp). higher net pricing was reflected across all categories driven by pricing actions taken during 2022. the august 1, 2022 acquisition of clif bar added incremental net revenues of $361 million and the january 3, 2022 acquisition of chipita added incremental net revenues of $35 million in 2022. favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in candy and chocolate, partially offset by a decline in biscuits & baked snacks which primarily reflected the impact of supply chain constraints on volume during the year. while the impact of divestitures reflected a year-over-year increase in net revenues of $22 million from our 2023 divested developed market gum business, it had a negative impact on the net revenue growth rate as the divested business did not grow as fast as the remaining segment. unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to the canadian dollar.
segment operating income increased $398 million (29.0%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower costs incurred for the simplify to grow program, lapping a prior year intangible asset impairment charge, the impact of acquisitions and the impact of divestitures. these favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher manufacturing costs, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments (including lapping a prior year benefit from contingent consideration adjustments), higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, fixed asset impairment charges incurred in 2022, inventory step-up charges incurred in 2022, unfavorable volume/mix, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses and unfavorable currency.
liquidity and capital resources we believe that cash from operations, our revolving credit facilities, short-term borrowings and our authorized long-term financing will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and future payments of our contractual, tax and benefit plan obligations and payments for acquisitions, share repurchases and quarterly dividends. we expect to continue to utilize our commercial paper program and international credit lines as needed. we continually evaluate long-term debt issuances to meet our short- and longer-term funding requirements. we also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. our investment in jde peet's provides us additional flexibility. overall, we do not expect negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity, and we continue to monitor our global operations including the impact of ongoing or new developments in ukraine and the middle east. to date, we have been successful in generating cash and raising financing as needed. however, if a serious economic or credit market crisis ensues or other adverse developments arise, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.
our most significant ongoing short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations (including expenditures for raw materials, labor, manufacturing and distribution, trade and promotions, advertising and marketing, tax liabilities, benefit plan obligations and lease expenses) as well as periodic expenditures for acquisitions, shareholder returns (such as dividend payments and share repurchases), property, plant and equipment and any significant one-time non-operating items.
long-term cash requirements primarily relate to funding long-term debt repayments (refer to note 9, debt and borrowing arrangements), our u.s. tax reform transition tax liability and deferred taxes (refer to note 16, income taxes), our long-term benefit plan obligations (refer to note 11, benefit plans) and commodity-related purchase commitments and derivative contracts (refer to note 10, financial instruments).
we generally fund short- and long-term cash requirements with cash from operating activities as well as cash proceeds from short- and long-term debt financing (refer to debt below). we generally do not use equity to fund our ongoing obligations.
for a full discussion related to the financial condition for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2021, including a year-to-year comparison between 2022 and 2021, see part ii, item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2022.
cash flow we believe our ability to generate substantial cash from operating activities and readily access capital markets and secure financing at competitive rates are key strengths and give us significant flexibility to meet our short and long-term financial commitments. our cash flow activity over the last three years is noted below:
net cash provided by operating activities                      $4,714                          $3,908                          $4,141
net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities             2,812                         (4,888)                            (26)
net cash used in financing activities                         (7,558)                           (456)                         (4,069)
net cash provided by operating activities the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in cash-basis net earnings. this is largely a result of business growth and acquisitions completed during 2022.
net cash used in/provided by investing activities the improvement in net cash provided by/used in investing activities was largely driven by lapping prior year cash consideration paid for the chipita, clif bar and ricolino acquisitions combined with proceeds from the developed market gum divestiture and higher proceeds from the current year kdp and jdep share sales as compared to the prior year jdep share sale, partially offset by lapping higher proceeds from the settlement and replacement of net investment hedge derivative contracts. refer to note 2, acquisitions and divestitures and note 7, investments for more information.
capital expenditures were $1,112 million in 2023, $906 million in 2022 and $965 million in 2021. we continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives. we expect 2024 capital expenditures to be up to $1.4 billion, including capital expenditures in connection with our simplify to grow program and for funding our strategic priorities. we expect to continue to fund these expenditures with cash from operations.
net cash used in financing activities the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower debt proceeds, higher debt repayments and an increase in dividends paid to shareholders, partially offset by lower share repurchases in 2023.
dividends we paid dividends of $2,160 million in 2023, $1,985 million in 2022 and $1,826 million in 2021. on july 27, 2023, the audit committee, with authorization delegated from our board of directors, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.425 per share of class a common stock, an increase of 10 percent, which would be $1.70 per common share on an annualized basis. the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.
for u.s. income tax purposes only, the company has determined that 100% of the distributions paid to its shareholders in 2023 are characterized as a qualified dividend paid from u.s. earnings and profits. see note 13, capital stock, to the consolidated financial statements and item 5, market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities - issuer purchases of equity securities, for information on our share repurchase program.
guarantees as discussed in note 14, commitments and contingencies, we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. as part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity.
debt the nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. as such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet short-term working capital or other financing needs.
at its december 2023 meeting, the board of directors approved a new $2 billion long-term financing authorization that replaced the prior long-term financing authorization of $2 billion. as of december 31, 2023, $2.0 billion of the long-term financing authorization remained available.
our total debt was $19.4 billion at december 31, 2023 and $22.9 billion at december 31, 2022. our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.41 at december 31, 2023 and 0.46 at december 31, 2022. the weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 7.8 years at december 31, 2023 and 8.2 years at december 31, 2022. our average daily commercial borrowings were $2.1 billion in 2023, $1.6 billion in 2022 and $0.5 billion in 2021.
commodity trends we regularly monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. during 2023, the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher energy, sugar, grains, dairy, cocoa, packaging, edible oils and other ingredient costs as well as unfavorable year-over-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials.
a number of external factors such as the current macroeconomic environment, including global inflation, effects of the war in ukraine, climate and weather conditions, commodity, transportation and labor market conditions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. we address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, such as dairy, where there is a limited ability to hedge, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. due to competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors, our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily.
as a result of international supply chain and labor market disruptions and generally higher commodity, transportation and labor costs, we expect price volatility and a higher aggregate cost environment to continue. while the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available.
non-gaap financial measures we use non-gaap financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. we use non-gaap financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. we have detailed the non-gaap adjustments that we make in our non-gaap definitions below. the adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition and divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. we believe the non-gaap measures should always be considered along with the related u.s. gaap financial measures. we have provided the reconciliations between the gaap and non-gaap financial measures along with a discussion of our underlying gaap results throughout our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form 10-k.
our primary non-gaap financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior year operating results. as new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. when our definitions change, we provide the updated definitions and present the related non-gaap historical results on a comparable basis (1).
•"organic net revenue" is defined as net revenues (the most comparable u.s. gaap financial measure) excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures (2), short-term distributor agreements related to the sale of a business (3), and currency rate fluctuations (4). we believe that organic net revenue reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results. we also evaluate organic net revenue growth from emerging markets and developed markets, and these underlying measures are also reconciled to u.s. gaap above.
•our emerging markets include our latin america region in its entirety; the amea region, excluding australia, new zealand and japan; and the following countries from the europe region: russia, ukraine, türkiye, kazakhstan, georgia, poland, czech republic, slovak republic, hungary, bulgaria, romania, the baltics and the east adriatic countries.
•our developed markets include the entire north america region, the europe region excluding the countries included in the emerging markets definition, and australia, new zealand and japan from the amea region.
•"adjusted operating income" is defined as operating income (the most comparable u.s. gaap financial measure) excluding the impacts of the simplify to grow program (5); gains or losses (including non-cash impairment charges) on goodwill and intangible assets; divestiture (2) or acquisition gains or losses, divestiture-related costs (6), acquisition-related costs (7), and acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments (8); inventory step-up charges (9); operating results of divestitures (2); operating results from short-term distributor agreements related to the sale of a business (3); remeasurement of net monetary position (10); mark-to-market impacts from commodity, forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivative contracts (11); impact from resolution of tax matters (12); 2017 malware incident net recoveries; incremental costs due to the war in ukraine (13); impact from the european commission legal matter (14); impact from pension participation changes (15); and costs associated with the jde peet's transaction. we also present "adjusted operating income margin," which is subject to the same adjustments as adjusted operating income. we also evaluate growth in our adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis (4). we believe these measures provide improved comparability of underlying operating results.
•"adjusted eps" is defined as diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international (the most comparable u.s. gaap financial measure) from continuing operations excluding the impacts of the items listed in the adjusted operating income definition as well as losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses; gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans; mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses and realized gains or losses from marketable securities (16); initial impacts from enacted tax law changes (17); and gains or losses on equity method investment transactions. similarly, within adjusted eps, our equity method investment net earnings exclude our proportionate share of our investee's significant operating and non-operating items (18). we also evaluate growth in our adjusted eps on a constant currency basis (4). we believe adjusted eps provides improved comparability of underlying operating results.
(1)when items no longer impact our current or future presentation of non-gaap operating results, we remove these items from our non-gaap definitions. in the first quarter of 2023, we added to the non-gaap definition for divestitures the inclusion of changes from equity method investment accounting to accounting for equity interests with readily determinable fair values ("marketable securities"; refer to footnote (2) below). in addition, we added to the non-gaap definitions the exclusion of gains or losses associated with marketable securities (see footnote (16) below). in the fourth quarter of 2023, we added to the non-gaap definitions the exclusion of the operating results from short-term distributor agreements related to the sale of a business (see footnote (3) below). in addition, we added to the non-gaap definitions the exclusion of realized gains and losses from derivatives that mitigate the foreign currency volatility related to the remeasurement of the respective net monetary assets or liabilities during the periods presented associated with applying highly inflationary accounting (see footnote (10) below).
(2)divestitures include completed sales of businesses, exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement, the partial or full sale of an equity method investment and changes from equity method investment accounting to accounting for marketable securities. as we record our share of jde peet's ongoing earnings on a one-quarter lag basis, any jde peet's ownership reductions are reflected as divestitures within our non-gaap results the following quarter.
(3)in the fourth quarter of 2023, we began to exclude the operating results from short-term distributor agreements that have been executed in conjunction with the sale of a business. we exclude this item to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.
(6)divestiture-related costs, which includes costs incurred in relation to the preparation and completion (including one-time costs such as severance related to the elimination of stranded costs) of our divestitures as defined in footnote (2), also includes costs incurred associated with our publicly-announced processes to sell businesses. we exclude these items to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.
(7)acquisition-related costs, which includes transaction costs such as third party advisor, investment banking and legal fees, also includes one-time compensation expense related to the buyout of non-vested esop shares and realized gains or losses from hedging activities associated with acquisition funds. we exclude these items to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.
(8)acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments include one-time costs related to the integration of acquisitions as well as any adjustments made to the fair market value of contingent compensation liabilities that have been previously booked for earn-outs related to acquisitions that do not relate to employee compensation expense. we exclude these items to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.
(9)in the third quarter of 2022, we began to exclude the one-time inventory step-up charges associated with acquired companies related to the fair market valuation of the acquired inventory. we exclude this item to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.
(10)in connection with our applying highly inflationary accounting (refer to note 1, summary of significant accounting policies), for argentina (beginning in the third quarter of 2018) and türkiye (beginning in the second quarter of 2022), we exclude the related remeasurement gains or losses related to remeasuring net monetary assets or liabilities denominated in the local currency to the u.s. dollar during the periods presented and the realized gains and losses from derivatives that mitigate the foreign currency volatility related to the remeasurement of the respective net monetary assets or liabilities during the periods presented.
(11)we exclude unrealized gains and losses (mark-to-market impacts) from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivative from our non-gaap earnings measures. the mark-to-market impacts of commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives are excluded until such time that the related exposures impact our operating results. since we purchase commodity and forecasted currency transaction contracts to mitigate price volatility primarily for inventory requirements in future periods, we make this adjustment to remove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. we exclude equity method investment transaction derivative contract settlements as they represent protection of value for future divestitures.
(12)see note 14, commitments and contingencies, in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022.
(13)in february 2022, russia began a military invasion of ukraine and we stopped our production and closed our facilities in ukraine for a period of time due to damage incurred to our facilities during the invasion. we began to incur incremental costs directly related to the war including asset impairments, such as property and inventory losses, higher expected allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable and committed compensation. we have isolated and exclude these costs and related impacts as well as subsequent recoveries from our operating results to facilitate evaluation and comparisons of our ongoing results. incremental costs related to increasing operations in other primarily european facilities are not included with these costs.
(14)in the fourth quarter of 2022, we began to exclude the impact from the european commission legal matter. in november 2019, the european commission informed us that it initiated an investigation into our alleged infringement of european union competition law through certain practices allegedly restricting cross-border trade within the european economic area. on january 28, 2021, the european commission announced it had taken the next procedural step in its investigation and opened formal proceedings. we have been cooperating with the investigation and are currently engaged in discussions with the european commission in an effort to reach a negotiated, proportionate resolution to this matter. due to the unique nature of this matter, we believe it to be infrequent and unusual and therefore exclude it to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. refer to note 14, commitments and contingencies, for additional information.
(15)the impact from pension participation changes represents the charges incurred when employee groups are withdrawn from multiemployer pension plans and other changes in employee group pension plan participation. we exclude these charges from our non-gaap results because those amounts do not reflect our ongoing pension obligations. see note 11, benefit plans, for more information on the multiemployer pension plan withdrawal.
(16)in the first quarter of 2023, we began to exclude mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses, as well as realized gains or losses, associated with our marketable securities from our non-gaap earnings measures. these marketable securities gains or losses are not indicative of underlying operations and are excluded to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.
(17)we have excluded the initial impacts from enacted tax law changes. initial impacts include items such as the remeasurement of deferred tax balances and the transition tax from the 2017 u.s. tax reform. we exclude initial impacts from enacted tax law changes from our adjusted eps as they do not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under the enacted tax law changes. refer to note 16, income taxes, for more information.
(18)we have excluded our proportionate share of our equity method investees' significant operating and non-operating items such as acquisition and divestiture related costs, restructuring program costs and initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, in order to provide investors with a comparable view of our performance across periods. although we have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with our ownership interests in our equity method investees and review the underlying operating results and significant operating and non-operating items each reporting period, we do not have direct control over their operations or resulting revenue and expenses. our use of equity method investment net earnings on an adjusted basis is not intended to imply that we have any such control. our gaap "diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international from continuing operations" includes all of the investees' significant operating and non-operating items.
we believe that the presentation of these non-gaap financial measures, when considered together with our u.s. gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding u.s. gaap financial measures, provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. because non-gaap financial measures vary among companies, the non-gaap financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. our use of these non-gaap financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any u.s. gaap financial measures. a limitation of these non-gaap financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our u.s. gaap reported results. the best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our non-gaap financial measures in combination with our u.s. gaap reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile u.s. gaap reported figures to the non-gaap financial measures in this form 10-k.
critical accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. we have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee. the following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates.
goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets we review our operating segment and reporting unit structure annually or as significant changes in the organization occur for goodwill testing throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. annually, on july 1, we test goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment and may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. in our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit's estimated fair value with its carrying value. we estimate a reporting unit's fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. this year, for our europe and north america reporting units, we used a market-based, weighted-average cost of capital of 7.1% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. for our latin america and amea reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 10.1%. estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions based on available information. given the uncertainty of the global economic environment, those estimates could be significantly different than future performance. if the carrying value of a reporting unit's net assets exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.
in 2023, 2022 and 2021, there were no impairments of goodwill. in connection with our 2023 annual impairment testing, each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value. while all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.
annually, we assess indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these assets. if significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. we utilize estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand's global fair value. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value.
in 2023, we recorded $26 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to a chocolate brand in the north america segment and a biscuit brand in the europe segment. the impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs. we use several accepted valuation methods, including relief from royalty, excess earnings and excess margin, that utilize estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand's global fair value. we also identified thirteen brands, of which five were recently acquired, with $3.7 billion of aggregate book value as of december 31, 2023 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. we believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to not be impaired, but if plans to grow brand earnings and expand margin are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. in 2022, we recorded $101 million of intangible asset impairment charge related to two biscuit brands in amea. in 2021, we recorded a $32 million of intangible asset impairment charge related to one biscuit brand in north america.

business combinations the assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the acquisition or consolidation of a business are recorded at fair value, with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. we engage third-party valuation specialists to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. in determining fair value, we utilized various forms of the income approach, depending on the asset being valued. such valuations require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. management makes estimates of fair value based upon the best information available at the date of acquisition. these estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain. critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include, but are not limited to: expected future cash flows of the acquired business, discount and royalty rates and economic lives of customer relationships, trade names and fixed assets. unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or estimates.
further, certain of our acquisitions may include earn-out provisions or other forms of contingent consideration. as of the acquisition date, we record contingent consideration, as applicable, at the estimated fair value of expected future payments associated with the earn-out. any changes to the recorded fair value of contingent consideration will be recognized as expenses or earnings in the period in which they occur. such contingent consideration liabilities are based on best estimates of future expected payment obligations, which are subject to change due to many factors outside of our control. changes to the estimate of expected future contingent consideration payments may occur, from time to time, due to various reasons, including changing discount rates as well as actual results differing from estimates and adjustments to the revenue or earnings assumptions used as the basis for the liability based on historical experience.
trade and marketing programs we promote our products with trade and sales incentives as well as marketing and advertising programs. these programs include, but are not limited to, new product introduction fees, discounts, coupons, rebates and volume-based incentives as well as cooperative advertising, in-store displays and consumer marketing promotions. trade and sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. for interim reporting purposes, advertising and consumer promotion expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated sales volume and estimated program spending. we do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheets and all marketing and advertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred.
employee benefit plans we sponsor various employee benefit plans worldwide, including primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits. for accounting purposes, we estimate the pension and postretirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates; expected returns on plan assets; expected compensation increases; employee-related factors such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; and health care cost trends. we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans.
we amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods to reflect the cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost). these changes are deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.
since pension and postretirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses. for plans that have assets held in trust, the expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses. the assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in note 11, benefit plans, along with additional information on our employee benefit plans.
as a sensitivity measure, a fifty-basis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects, increase/(decrease), on our annual benefit plan costs:
postretirement health care costs income taxes as a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. the provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. we review the realizability assessment on a quarterly basis, including impacts from our latest estimates of future taxable income.
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax positions. we recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution. we evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the amount recognized in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations. we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. however, final determination of historical tax liabilities, whether by settlement with tax authorities, judicial or administrative ruling or due to expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and historical income tax provisions. the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes, net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made.

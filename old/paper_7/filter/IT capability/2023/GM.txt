overview our vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. we will adapt to customer preferences while executing our growth-focused strategy to invest in evs, hybrids, avs, software-enabled services and other new business opportunities. to support strong margins and cash flow during this transition, we are strengthening our market position in profitable ice vehicles, such as trucks and suvs. we plan to execute our strategy with a steadfast commitment to good corporate citizenship through more sustainable operations and a leading health and safety culture.
our financial performance in 2023 was driven by the success of high-margin products like full-size pick-ups and suvs, despite several headwinds, including higher interest rates and inflationary pressures, supply chain and logistics challenges, and work stoppages associated with recent labor negotiations. this performance was due to the strength of our vehicle portfolio, strong consumer demand and execution of our core business strategy, focused on fixed cost reduction and pricing discipline.
in january 2023, we announced our intention to implement a cost reduction program to reduce automotive fixed costs by $2.0 billion on an annual run rate basis by the end of 2024. this goal includes the impact of higher expected depreciation and amortization expense and inflationary cost increases on fixed cost but excludes changes in our pension income. in march 2023, general motors company and subsidiaries we announced performance-based exits and a voluntary separation program (vsp) in an effort to accelerate attrition, which we believe will result in approximately $1.0 billion towards this target on an annual run rate basis. in addition to people costs, we are reducing our marketing and advertising expenses, streamlining our engineering expense by reducing complexity across the vehicle portfolio, adjusting the cadence of our ev launches due to customer demand, reducing launch-related expenses in the near-term, reprioritizing growth initiatives and reducing our overall overhead and discretionary costs.
as we continue to assess our performance and the needs of our evolving business, additional restructuring and rationalization actions could be required. these actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may have a material impact on our operating results. refer to the consolidated results and regional sections of this md&a for additional information.
our collective bargaining agreement with the uaw, which was ratified in october 2019, expired on september 14, 2023. on september 15, 2023, the uaw initiated a strike at certain of our u.s. facilities and intermittently expanded the strike to additional facilities, causing stoppages to some vehicle production and parts distribution activities across our u.s. operations. we estimate that the lost vehicle production volumes and parts sales due to the uaw strike had an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.8 billion on net income attributable to stockholders and $1.1 billion on our gmna ebit-adjusted in the year ended december 31, 2023.
on november 16, 2023, the uaw ratified a new collective bargaining agreement (the labor agreement). the labor agreement, which continues through april 30, 2028, covers the wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment for our uaw-represented employees. the key terms and provisions of the labor agreement are:
•consolidation of applicable wage classifications for in-progression, temporary and other employees - with employees reaching the top classification rate upon the completion of 156 weeks of active service;
•for members currently employed and enrolled in the employees' pension plan, an increase of $5.00 to the monthly basic benefit for past and future service provided;
beginning in 2024 and through the end of the term of the labor agreement, gm will offer three separate cash severance incentive programs to uaw-represented employees that meet the normal or early retirement eligibility requirements.
on august 16, 2022, the ira was enacted. the ira modified climate and clean energy tax provisions and added new corporate tax credits for commercial ev purchases and investments in clean energy production, supply chains and manufacturing facilities. ira benefits, including credits and lower material costs, are expected to materially affect net income in the future. we will continue to evaluate the ira impacts on our financial results as additional regulatory guidance is issued.
we face continuing market, operating and regulatory challenges in several countries across the globe due to, among other factors, competitive pressures, our product portfolio offerings, heightened emission standards, labor disruptions, foreign exchange volatility, evolving trade policy and political uncertainty. refer to part i, item 1a. risk factors for a discussion of these challenges.
for the year ending december 31, 2024, we expect eps-diluted and eps-diluted-adjusted of between $8.50 and $9.50, net income attributable to stockholders of between $9.8 billion and $11.2 billion and ebit-adjusted of between $12.0 billion and $14.0 billion. these expected financial results do not include the potential impact of future adjustments related to special items. refer to the "non-gaap measures" section of this md&a for additional information.
general motors company and subsidiaries the following table reconciles expected net income attributable to stockholders under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) to expected ebit-adjusted (dollars in billions):
ebit-adjusted(a)                                                      $ 12.0-14.0
gmna industry sales in north america were 19.6 million units in the year ended december 31, 2023, representing an increase of 13.1% compared to the corresponding period in 2022. u.s. industry sales were 16.0 million units in the year ended december 31, 2023, representing an increase of 12.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2022.
our total vehicle sales in the u.s., our largest market in north america, were 2.6 million units for a market share of 16.2% in the year ended december 31, 2023, representing an increase of 0.3 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2022.
we expect to sustain relatively strong ebit-adjusted margins in 2024 on the continued strength of our product portfolio, improved ev margins and ongoing fixed cost reduction efforts, partially offset by pricing moderation with increased incentives. while we expect ev margins to improve in 2024, it is possible that we will continue to recognize losses to adjust inventory to net realizable value. our outlook is dependent on the resiliency of the u.s. economy, continuing improvement of supply chain availability, ev-related cost reduction and overall economic conditions.
gmi industry sales in china were 25.0 million units in the year ended december 31, 2023, representing an increase of 6.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2022. our total vehicle sales in china were 2.1 million units resulting in a market share of 8.4% in the year ended december 31, 2023, representing a decrease of 1.4 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2022. the ongoing supply chain disruptions, global macro-economic conditions and geopolitical tensions continue to place pressure on china's automotive industry and our vehicle sales in china. our automotive china jvs generated equity income of $0.4 billion in the year ended december 31, 2023. price competition, growing customer acceptance of domestic brands and demand for nevs, and a more challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and nevs have and will continue to place pressure on our operations in china.
outside of china, industry sales were 25.7 million units in the year ended december 31, 2023, representing an increase of 7.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2022. our total vehicle sales outside of china were 1.0 million units for a market share of 4.0% in the year ended december 31, 2023, which is comparable to the corresponding period in 2022.
cruise cruise holdings, our majority-owned subsidiary, is pursuing the development and commercialization of av technology. in october 2023, a hit-and-run accident involving a pedestrian and a third-party vehicle occurred, which resulted in the pedestrian being thrown into the path of a cruise av. during the resulting investigation, regulators perceived that cruise representatives were not explicit about a secondary movement of the cruise av and, as a result, the california dmv suspended cruise's permits to operate avs in california without a safety driver. shortly thereafter, cruise voluntarily paused all of its driverless, supervised and manual av operations in the u.s. while it examines its processes, systems and tools. this orderly pause is designed to rebuild public trust while cruise undertakes a comprehensive safety review. in addition, certain federal and state agencies, including the california dmv, the california public utilities commission, nhtsa, the u.s. department of justice and the sec, have opened investigations or made inquiries in connection with the incident. we and cruise are investigating these matters internally and intend to cooperate with all government regulators and agencies in connection with these matters. at this time, we are not able to predict when cruise will resume driverless testing or commercial av operations. refer to part i, item 1a. risk factors for a further discussion of the risks associated with our av strategy.
in connection with the pause in operations and cruise's refocused operational strategy, we recorded restructuring charges of $0.5 billion in the three months ended december 31, 2023, and also expect reductions of approximately $1.0 billion in cruise expenses in 2024.
general motors company and subsidiaries automotive financing - gm financial summary and outlook we believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental gm financial earnings and help support our sales throughout various economic cycles. gm financial's penetration of our retail sales in the u.s. was 42% in the year ended december 31, 2023 and 43% in the corresponding period in 2022. penetration levels vary depending on incentive financing programs available and competing third-party financing products in the market. gm financial's prime loan originations as a percentage of total loan originations in north america was 82% in the year ended december 31, 2023 and 80% in the corresponding period in 2022. in the year ended december 31, 2023, gm financial's revenue consisted of leased vehicle income of 51%, retail finance charge income of 37% and commercial finance charge income of 7%.
gm financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. gains on terminations of leased vehicles of $0.9 billion and $1.2 billion were included in gm financial interest, operating and other expenses in the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022. the decrease in gains is primarily due to higher leased portfolio net book values at termination and fewer terminated leases in 2023 compared to 2022. the following table summarizes the estimated residual value based on gm financial's most recent estimates and the number of units included in gm financial equipment on operating leases, net by vehicle type (units in thousands):

gmna total net sales and revenue in the year ended december 31, 2023, total net sales and revenue increased primarily due to: (1) increased net wholesale volumes primarily due to increased sales of crossover vehicles and full-size pickup trucks, partially offset by decreased sales of mid-size pickup trucks; (2) favorable price as a result of low dealer inventory levels and strong demand for our products; (3) favorable mix associated with increased sales of full-size pickup trucks and full-size suvs and decreased sales of vans, passenger cars and mid-size pickup trucks, partially offset by increased sales of crossover vehicles; and (4) favorable other due to increased sales of parts and accessories.
gmna ebit-adjusted the most significant factors that influence profitability are industry volume and market share. while not as significant as industry volume and market share, another factor affecting profitability is the relative mix of vehicles sold. trucks, crossovers and cars sold currently have a variable profit of approximately 170%, 40% and 50% of our gmna portfolio on a weighted-average basis.
in the year ended december 31, 2023, ebit-adjusted decreased primarily due to: (1) increased cost primarily due to increased campaigns and other warranty-related costs of $2.0 billion, increased ev-related charges of $1.9 billion primarily due to $1.6 billion in inventory adjustments to reflect the net realizable value at period end, decreased non-service pension income of $1.1 billion and increased manufacturing costs of $0.9 billion, partially offset by decreased advertising, selling and administrative costs of $1.1 billion; and (2) unfavorable mix associated with increased sales of crossover vehicles partially general motors company and subsidiaries offset by decreased sales of mid-size pickup trucks and passengers cars and increased sales of full-size suvs; partially offset by (3) favorable price; and (4) favorable volume.

cruise ebit (loss)-adjusted in the year ended december 31, 2023, ebit (loss)-adjusted increased primarily due to an increase in development costs as we pursue the development and commercialization of av technology in the u.s. and globally.
gm financial ebt-adjusted in the year ended december 31, 2023, ebt-adjusted decreased primarily due to: (1) increased interest expense of $1.8 billion primarily due to an increased effective rate of interest on debt, resulting from higher benchmark interest rates, as well as an increase in average debt outstanding; (2) decreased leased vehicle income net of leased vehicle expenses of $0.9 billion primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of the leased vehicles portfolio and decreased lease termination gains due to higher leased portfolio net book values at termination and fewer terminated leases; (3) increased provision for loan losses of $0.2 billion due to lower recovery rates in 2023, as well as moderating credit performance; partially offset by (4) increased finance charge income of $1.7 billion primarily due to an increase in the effective yield resulting from higher benchmark interest rates and growth in the size of the portfolio; and (5) increased investment income of $0.3 billion primarily due to an increase in benchmark interest rates.
liquidity and capital resources we believe our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and other liquidity actions currently available to us are sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements in the short- and long-term. we also maintain access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. we have substantial cash requirements going forward, which we plan to fund through our total available liquidity, cash flows from operating activities and additional liquidity measures, if determined to be necessary.
our known current material uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital spending and our investments in our battery cell manufacturing joint ventures of approximately $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion in 2024; (2) payments for engineering and product development activities, including investing in the development and commercialization of av technology by cruise; (3) payments associated with previously announced vehicle recalls and any other recall-related contingencies; (4) payments to service debt and other long-term obligations, including discretionary and mandatory contributions to our pension plans; (5) dividend payments on our common stock that are declared by our board of directors; and (6) payments to purchase shares of our common stock authorized by our board of directors. refer to note 7, note 13 and note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional funding requirements for our operating leases, debt and pension plans. our material future uses of cash, which may vary from time to time based on market conditions and other factors, are general motors company and subsidiaries focused on the three objectives of our capital allocation program: (1) grow our business at an average target roic-adjusted rate of 20% or greater; (2) maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet, including a target average automotive cash balance of $18.0 billion; and (3) after the first two objectives are met, return available cash to shareholders. our senior management evaluates our capital allocation program on an ongoing basis and recommends any modifications to the program to our board of directors not less than once annually.
we continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our competitive position over the long term while maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet. these actions may include opportunistic payments to reduce our long-term obligations, as well as the possibility of acquisitions, dispositions and investments with joint venture partners, as well as strategic alliances that we believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business. to support our transition to evs, we anticipate making investments in suppliers or providing funding towards the execution of strategic, multi-year supply agreements to secure critical materials. in addition, we have entered, and plan to continue to enter, into offtake agreements that generally obligate us to purchase defined quantities of output. these arrangements could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory.
our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the "forward-looking statements" section of this md&a and part i, item 1a. risk factors, some of which are outside of our control.
in november 2023, our board of directors increased the capacity under our previously announced common stock repurchase program by $10.0 billion to $11.4 billion and approved a $10.0 billion asr program. on december 1, 2023, we advanced $10.0 billion under the asr program and received approximately 215 million shares of common stock with a value of $6.8 billion, which were immediately retired. the final settlement of the transactions contemplated under the asr agreements is expected to occur no later than the three months ending december 31, 2024. also, during the year ended december 31, 2023, we completed $1.1 billion of open market repurchases under the program and retired approximately 30 million shares of our common stock. we have $1.4 billion in capacity remaining under our common stock repurchase program as of december 31, 2023, with no expiration date.
cash flows that occur amongst our automotive, cruise and gm financial operations are eliminated when we consolidate our cash flows. such eliminations include, among other things, collections by automotive on wholesale accounts receivables financed by dealers through gm financial, payments between automotive and gm financial for accounts receivables transferred by automotive to gm financial, loans to automotive and cruise from gm financial, dividends issued by gm financial to automotive, tax payments by gm financial to automotive and automotive cash injections in cruise. the presentation of automotive liquidity, cruise liquidity and gm financial liquidity presented below includes the impact of cash transactions amongst the sectors that are ultimately eliminated in consolidation.
automotive liquidity total available liquidity includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and funds available under credit facilities. the amount of available liquidity is subject to seasonal fluctuations and includes balances held by various business units and subsidiaries worldwide that are needed to fund their operations.
we manage our liquidity primarily at our treasury centers as well as at certain of our significant consolidated overseas subsidiaries. over 85% of our cash and marketable debt securities were managed within north america and at our regional treasury centers at december 31, 2023. we have used, and will continue to use, other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these funds across our global operations as needed.
our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities balances are primarily denominated in u.s. dollars and include investments in u.s. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits, corporate debt securities and mortgage and asset-backed securities. our investment guidelines, which we may change from time to time, prescribe certain minimum credit worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. the majority of our current investments in debt securities are with a/a2 or better rated issuers.
in march 2023, we redeemed our $1.5 billion, 4.875% senior unsecured notes with a maturity date of october 2023 and recorded an insignificant loss.
general motors company and subsidiaries also, in march 2023, we renewed and reduced the total borrowing capacity of our five-year, $11.2 billion facility to $10.0 billion, which now matures march 31, 2028. we also renewed and reduced the total borrowing capacity of our three-year, $4.3 billion facility to $4.1 billion, which now matures march 31, 2026, and renewed our 364-day, $2.0 billion revolving credit facility allocated for the exclusive use of gm financial, which now matures march 30, 2024.
in october 2023, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of $6.0 billion, which we terminated on november 24, 2023.
in november 2023, the company entered an unsecured 364-day delayed draw term loan credit agreement that permits the company to borrow up to $3.0 billion in the form of four term loans during an availability period that ends june 28, 2024. amounts drawn and repaid may not be reborrowed and the final maturity date for any loans outstanding under the delayed draw credit agreement is november 27, 2024.
we use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. our automotive borrowing capacity under credit facilities totaled $17.1 billion at december 31, 2023, which consisted primarily of three credit facilities, and $15.5 billion at december 31, 2022, which consisted primarily of two credit facilities. total automotive borrowing capacity under our credit facilities does not include our 364-day, $2.0 billion facility allocated for exclusive use of gm financial. we did not have any borrowings against our primary facilities, but had letters of credit outstanding under our sub-facility of $0.7 billion and $0.4 billion at december 31, 2023 and 2022.
if available capacity permits, gm financial continues to have access to our five-year, $10.0 billion and three-year, $4.1 billion credit facilities. gm financial did not have borrowings outstanding against any of these facilities at december 31, 2023 and 2022. we had intercompany loans from gm financial of $0.2 billion at december 31, 2023 and 2022, which primarily consisted of commercial loans to dealers we consolidate. we did not have intercompany loans to gm financial at december 31, 2023 and 2022. refer to note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
several of our loan facilities, including our credit facilities, require compliance with certain financial and operational covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders. we have reviewed our covenants in effect as of december 31, 2023 and determined we are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance in the future.
gm financial's board of directors declared and paid dividends of $1.8 billion, $1.7 billion and $3.5 billion on its common stock in the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. future dividends from gm financial will depend on several factors including business and economic conditions, its financial condition, earnings, liquidity requirements and leverage ratio.

gm financial structures liquidity to support at least six months of gm financial's expected net cash flows, including new originations, without access to new debt financing transactions or other capital markets activity. at december 31, 2023, available liquidity exceeded gm financial's liquidity targets.
gm financial did not have any borrowings outstanding against our credit facility designated for their exclusive use or the remainder of our revolving credit facilities at december 31, 2023 and 2022. refer to the "automotive liquidity" section of this md&a for additional details.
credit facilities in the normal course of business, in addition to using its available cash, gm financial utilizes borrowings under its credit facilities, which may be secured or unsecured, and gm financial repays these borrowings as appropriate under its cash management strategy. at december 31, 2023, secured, committed unsecured and uncommitted unsecured credit facilities totaled $27.0 billion, $0.8 billion and $2.0 billion with advances outstanding of $5.0 billion, an insignificant amount and $2.0 billion.

in the year ended december 31, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to: (1) an increase in finance charge income of $1.7 billion; (2) a net increase in cash provided by counterparty derivative collateral posting activities of $1.3 billion; (3) and a decrease in taxes paid to gm of $0.6 billion; partially offset by (4) an increase in interest paid of $2.0 billion and (5) a decrease in leased vehicle income of $0.5 billion.
in the year ended december 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities increased primarily due to: (1) an increase in purchases of leased vehicles of $1.7 billion; (2) a decrease in the proceeds from termination of leased vehicles of $1.2 billion partially offset by (3) an increase in collections and recoveries on finance receivables of $1.3 billion; (4) and a decrease in purchases and originations of finance receivables of $0.5 billion.
general motors company and subsidiaries in the year ended december 31, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities increased primarily due to: (1) a net increase in borrowings of $6.9 billion; partially offset by (2) an increase in debt repayments of $5.1 billion; and (3) an increase in dividend payments of $0.1 billion.
libor transition the international swaps and derivatives association launched its interbank offered rate (ibor) fallbacks supplement and ibor fallbacks protocol, which came into effect on january 25, 2021. the supplement incorporates fallbacks for new derivatives linked to libor, and the protocol enables market participants to incorporate fallbacks for certain legacy derivatives linked to libor. gm financial adhered to the protocol prior to the june 30, 2023 cessation date and has transitioned all of its libor-based derivative exposure. on march 15, 2022, congress enacted the adjustable interest rate (libor) act to address "tough legacy" contracts that lack adequate fallback provisions for determining a benchmark replacement to libor. gm financial expects to leverage the safe harbors and protections provided by the libor act and its implementing regulations to transition its limited libor exposure remaining after the cessation date.
critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. we believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.
product warranty and recall campaigns the estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. when little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based on comparable models.
the estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. these estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. these estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.
the estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. the estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. a 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.4 billion.
actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.
sales incentives the estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. a change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. a 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales general motors company and subsidiaries incentive liability by approximately $0.2 billion. subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in automotive net sales and revenue.
gm financial allowance for loan losses  the gm financial retail finance receivables portfolio consists of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans that are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. the allowance for loan losses on retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which have a weighted-average remaining life of approximately two years. gm financial forecasts net credit losses based on relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. gm financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that our credit loss assumptions will not increase.
gm financial incorporates its outlook on forecast recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate. each 5% relative decrease/increase in the forecast recovery rates would increase/decrease the allowance for loan losses by $0.1 billion.
at december 31, 2023, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio of $2.3 billion. if the forecast economic conditions were based entirely on the weakest scenario considered, the allowance for loan losses would increase by $0.1 billion. actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by gm financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.
the gm financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of financing products for dealers and other businesses. gm financial provides commercial lending products to its dealer customers that include floorplan financing, also known as wholesale or inventory financing, which is lending to finance vehicle inventory. gm financial also provides dealer loans, which are loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, or to purchase and/or finance dealership real estate. additionally, gm financial provides lending products to commercial vehicle upfitters and advances to certain of our subsidiaries. the allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry conditions. there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that gm financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.
valuation of gm financial equipment on operating lease assets and residuals gm financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases. each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that gm financial owns and has leased to a customer. at the inception of a lease, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from two to five years. gm financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices.
during the term of a lease, gm financial periodically evaluates the estimated residual value and may adjust the value downward, which increases the prospective depreciation, or upward (limited to the contractual residual value), which decreases the prospective depreciation.
the customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. however, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, gm financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the proceeds gm financial receives on the disposition of the vehicle are lower than the residual value estimated at the inception of the lease. realization of the residual values is dependent on gm financial's future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.
at december 31, 2023, the estimated residual value of gm financial's leased vehicles was $22.7 billion. depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in gm financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its expected residual value at the end of the lease term. if used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, gm financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record an impairment charge on the lease portfolio. if an impairment exists, gm financial would determine any shortfall in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1) the sum of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value; over (2) leased vehicles, net less deferred revenue. alternatively, if used vehicle prices outperform gm financial's latest estimates, it may record gains on sales of off-lease vehicles and/or decreased depreciation expense.
changes to residual values are rarely simultaneous across all maturities and segments, and also may impact return rates. if a decrease in residual values is concentrated among specific asset groups, the decrease could result in an immediate impairment charge. gm financial reviewed the leased vehicle portfolio for indicators of impairment and determined that no impairment indicators were present at december 31, 2023 or 2022.
pension and opeb plans our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement. our pension obligations include korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a walk away basis. the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return.
another key assumption in determining net pension and other postretirement benefits (opeb) expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations. we estimate the assumed discount rate for u.s. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weighted-average discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows. we apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost, which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment.
the society of actuaries (soa) issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended december 31, 2023. we reviewed our recent mortality experience and we determined our current mortality assumptions are appropriate to measure our u.s. pension and opeb plans obligations as of december 31, 2023.
general motors company and subsidiaries the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans, holding all other assumptions constant:
(a)the sensitivity does not include the effects of the individual annual yield curve rates applied for the calculation of the service and interest cost.
refer to note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension contributions, investment strategies, assumptions, the change in benefit obligations and related plan assets, pension funding requirements and future net benefit payments. refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the inputs used to determine fair value for each significant asset class or category.
valuation of deferred tax assets  the ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. the assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events. changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated market conditions, governmental legislative actions or events, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets.
at december 31, 2023, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets were $7.0 billion. refer to note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of these valuation allowances and information on the $870 million income tax benefit resulting from the release of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in korea.
non-gaap measures we use both gaap and non-gaap financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess company and segment business performance. our non-gaap measures include: earnings before interest and taxes (ebit)-adjusted, presented net of noncontrolling interests; earnings before income taxes (ebt)-adjusted for our gm financial segment; earnings per share (eps)-diluted-adjusted; effective tax rate-adjusted (etr-adjusted); return on invested capital-adjusted (roic-adjusted) and adjusted automotive free cash flow. our calculation of these non-gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. as a result, the use of these non-gaap measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related u.s. gaap measures.
these non-gaap measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. furthermore, these non-gaap measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve roic-adjusted. management uses these measures in its financial, investment and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. further, our board of directors uses certain of these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our performance-based compensation plans. for these reasons, we believe these non-gaap measures are useful for our investors.
ebit-adjusted (most comparable gaap measure: net income attributable to stockholders) ebit-adjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income, automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations. examples of adjustments to ebit include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. for ebit-adjusted and our other non-
general motors company and subsidiaries gaap measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-gaap measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. our corresponding measure for our gm financial segment is ebt-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.
eps-diluted-adjusted (most comparable gaap measure: diluted earnings per common share)  eps-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted eps results on a consistent basis. eps-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders-diluted less adjustments noted above for ebit-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted. examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.
etr-adjusted (most comparable gaap measure: effective tax rate)  etr-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. etr-adjusted is calculated as income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for ebit-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for eps-diluted-adjusted divided by income before income taxes less adjustments. when we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the u.s. gaap measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.
roic-adjusted (most comparable gaap measure: return on equity) roic-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital allocation decisions. we define roic-adjusted as ebit-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by roic-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and opeb liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.
adjusted automotive free cash flow (most comparable gaap measure: net automotive cash provided by operating activities)  adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. we measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. management actions can include voluntary events such as discretionary contributions to employee benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for ebit-adjusted purposes. refer to the "liquidity and capital resources" section of this md&a for additional information.

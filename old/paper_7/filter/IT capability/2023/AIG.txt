aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | use of non-gaap measures use of non-gaap measures throughout this md&a, we present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful and representative of our business results. some of the measurements we use are "non-gaap financial measures" under sec rules and regulations. gaap is the acronym for "generally accepted accounting principles" in the united states. the non-gaap financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly-named measures reported by other companies.
we use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments. we believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors. when we use these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure are provided on a consolidated basis in the consolidated results of operations section of this md&a.
book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (aoci) adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude re funds withheld assets and deferred tax assets (dta) (adjusted book value per common share) is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-common share basis after eliminating items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value (1) of aig's available for sale securities portfolio, (2) of market risk benefits attributable to our own credit risk and (3) due to discount rates used to measure traditional and limited payment long-duration insurance contracts, foreign currency translation adjustments and u.s. tax attribute deferred tax assets. this measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. in addition, we adjust for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude re funds withheld assets held by aig in support of fortitude re's reinsurance obligations to aig post deconsolidation of fortitude re (fortitude re funds withheld assets) since these fair value movements are economically transferred to fortitude re. we exclude deferred tax assets representing u.s. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the dta utilized is included in these book value per common share metrics. adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total aig common shareholders' equity, excluding aoci adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude re funds withheld assets, and dta (adjusted common shareholders' equity), by total common shares outstanding.
return on common equity - adjusted after-tax income excluding aoci adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude re funds withheld assets and dta (adjusted return on common equity) is used to show the rate of return on common shareholders' equity. we believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value (1) of aig's available for sale securities portfolio, (2) of market risk benefits attributable to our own credit risk and (3) due to discount rates used to measure traditional and limited payment long-duration insurance contracts, foreign currency translation adjustments and u.s. tax attribute deferred tax assets. this measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. in addition, we adjust for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude re funds withheld assets since these fair value movements are economically transferred to fortitude re. we exclude deferred tax assets representing u.s. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the dta utilized is included in adjusted return on common equity. adjusted return on common equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized adjusted after-tax income attributable to aig common shareholders by average adjusted common shareholders' equity.
adjusted after-tax income attributable to aig common shareholders is derived by excluding the tax effected adjusted pre-tax income (apti) adjustments described below, dividends on preferred stock, noncontrolling interest on net realized gains (losses), other non-operating expenses and the following tax items from net income attributable to aig:
•changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; and
adjusted revenues exclude net realized gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in other income for gaap purposes), changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in net investment income for gaap purposes) and income from elimination of the international reporting lag. adjusted revenues is a gaap measure for our segments.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | use of non-gaap measures adjusted pre-tax income is derived by excluding the items set forth below from income from continuing operations before income tax. this definition is consistent across our segments. these items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and measures that we believe to be common to the industry. apti is a gaap measure for our segments. excluded items include the following:
•changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits;
•net change in market risk benefits (mrbs);
•changes in benefit reserves related to net realized gains and losses;
•changes in the fair value of equity securities;
•net investment income on fortitude re funds withheld assets;
•following deconsolidation of fortitude re, net realized gains and losses on fortitude re funds withheld assets;
•all net realized gains and losses except earned income (periodic settlements and changes in settlement accruals) on derivative instruments used for non-qualifying (economic) hedging or for asset replication. earned income on such economic hedges is reclassified from net realized gains and losses to specific apti line items based on the economic risk being hedged (e.g. net investment income and interest credited to policyholder account balances);
•net loss reserve discount benefit (charge);
•net gain or loss on divestitures and other;
•non-operating litigation reserves and settlements;
•restructuring and other costs related to initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, improve efficiency and simplify our organization;
•integration and transaction costs associated with acquiring or divesting businesses;
•non-recurring costs associated with the implementation of non-ordinary course legal or regulatory changes or changes to accounting principles; and
-ratios: we, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. these ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for general insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under gaap, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. the underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. in addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.
-accident year loss and accident year combined ratios, as adjusted (accident year loss ratio, ex-cat and accident year combined ratio, ex-cat): both the accident year loss and accident year combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events, in each case, having a net impact on aig in excess of $10 million and man-made catastrophe losses, such as terrorism and civil disorders that exceed the $10 million threshold. we believe that as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of management's control. we also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results.
-premiums and deposits: includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and life-contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment-type annuity contracts, federal home loan bank (fhlb) funding agreements and mutual funds. we believe the measure of premiums and deposits is useful in understanding customer demand for our products, evolving product trends and our sales performance period over period.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment.
the accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, which are critical accounting estimates, are related to the determination of:
•loss reserves;•valuation of future policy benefit liabilities and recognition of measurement gains and losses;•valuation of mrbs related to guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity, fixed annuity and fixed index annuity products;•valuation of embedded derivative liabilities for fixed index annuity and index universal life products;•reinsurance assets, including the allowance for credit losses and disputes;•goodwill impairment;•allowance for credit losses on certain investments, primarily on loans and available for sale fixed maturity securities;•fair value measurements of certain financial assets and financial liabilities; and•income taxes, in particular the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and establishment of provisions for uncertain tax positions.
these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. to the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected.
•the determination of the appropriate groupings of similar product lines and, in some cases, the disaggregation of dissimilar losses within a product line.
all of our methods to calculate net reserves include assumptions about estimated reinsurance recoveries and their collectability. reinsurance collectability is evaluated independently of the reserving process and appropriate allowances for uncollectible reinsurance are established.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates short-tail reserves in short-tail lines of business, such as property or personal insurance, where the nature of these claims tends to be higher frequency with short reporting periods, with volatility arising from occasional severe events, the actual losses reported make up a greater proportion of the ultimate loss estimate. during the first few development quarters of an accident year, the expected ultimate losses generally reflect the average loss costs from a period of preceding accident quarters that have been adjusted for changes in rate and loss cost trends, mix of business, known exposure to unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular line of business. for more mature quarters, specific loss development methods and/or frequency/severity methods may be used to determine the incurred but not reported (ibnr). ibnr for claims arising from catastrophic events or events of unusual severity would be determined taking into account information known by the claims department, using alternative techniques or expected percentages of ultimate loss emergence based on historical emergence of similar events or claim types.
long-tail reserves estimation of loss reserves for our long-tail business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the product line and volume of business, as well as estimates of reinsurance recoveries. experience in more recent accident years generally provides limited statistical credibility of reported net losses on long-tail business. that is because in the more recent accident years, a relatively low proportion of estimated ultimate net incurred losses are reported or paid. therefore, ibnr reserves constitute a relatively high proportion of loss reserves.
for our long-tail lines, we generally make actuarial and other assumptions with respect to the following:
•tail factors, which are development factors used for certain long-tail lines of business to project future loss development for periods that extend beyond the available development data. the development of losses to the ultimate loss for a given accident year for these lines may take decades and the projection of ultimate losses for an accident year is very sensitive to the tail factors selected beyond a certain age.
we record quarterly changes in loss reserves for each product line of business. the overall change in our loss reserves is based on the sum of the changes for all product lines of business. the quarterly loss reserve changes are based on the estimated current loss ratio for each subset of coverage less any amounts paid. also, any change in estimated ultimate losses from prior accident years deemed to be necessary based on the results of our latest detailed valuation reviews, large loss analyses, or other analytical techniques, either positive or negative, is reflected in the loss reserve and incurred losses for the current quarter. differences between actual loss emergence in a given period and our expectations based on prior loss reserve estimates are used to monitor reserve adequacy between detailed valuation reviews and may also influence our judgment with respect to adjusting reserve estimates.
we conduct a comprehensive loss reserve detailed valuation review at least annually for each product line of business in accordance with actuarial standards of practice. these standards provide that the unpaid loss estimate may be presented in a variety of ways, such as a point estimate, a range of estimates, a point estimate based on the expected value of several reasonable estimates, or a probability distribution of the unpaid loss amount. our actuarial best estimate for each product line of business represents an expected value generally considering a range of reasonably possible outcomes.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates the reserve analysis, globally, for each product line of business is performed by a credentialed actuarial team in collaboration with claims, underwriting, business unit management, risk management and senior management. our actuaries consider the ongoing applicability of prior data groupings and update numerous assumptions, including the analysis and selection of loss development and loss trend factors. they also determine and select the appropriate actuarial or other methods used to develop our best estimate for each business product line, and may employ multiple methods and assumptions for each product line. these data groupings, accident year weights, method selections and assumptions necessarily change over time as business mix changes, development factors mature and become more credible and loss characteristics evolve. we consult with third-party specialists to help inform our judgments as needed. through the execution of these detailed valuation reviews an actuarial best estimate of the loss reserve is determined. the sum of these estimates for each product line of business yields an overall actuarial best estimate for that line of business.
a critical component of our detailed valuation reviews is an internal peer review of our reserving analyses and conclusions, where actuaries independent of the initial review evaluate the reasonableness of assumptions used, methods selected, and weightings given to different methods. in addition, each detailed valuation review is subjected to a review and challenge process by specialists in our enterprise risk management (erm) group.
for certain product lines, we measure sensitivities and determine explicit ranges around the actuarial best estimate using multiple methodologies and varying assumptions. where we have ranges, we use them to inform our selection of best estimates of loss reserves by product line of business. our range of reasonable estimates is not intended to cover all possibilities or extreme values and is based on known data and facts at the time of estimation.
actuarial and other methods for our lines of business our actuaries determine the appropriate actuarial methods and segmentation. this determination is based on a variety of factors including the nature of the losses associated with the product line of business, such as the frequency or severity of the claims. in addition to determining the actuarial methods, the actuaries determine the appropriate loss reserve groupings of data. this determination is a judgmental, dynamic process and refinements to the groupings are made every year. the groupings may change to reflect observed or emerging patterns within and across product lines, or to differentiate risk characteristics (for example, size of deductibles and extent of third-party claims specialists used by our insureds). as an example of reserve segmentation, we write many unique subsets of professional liability insurance, which cover different products, industry segments, and coverage structures. while for pricing or other purposes, it may be appropriate to evaluate the profitability of each subset individually, we believe it is appropriate to combine the subsets into larger groups for reserving purposes to produce a greater degree of credibility in the loss experience. this determination of data segmentation and related actuarial methods is assessed, reviewed and updated at least annually.
the actuarial methods we use most commonly include paid and incurred loss development methods, expected loss ratio methods, including "bornhuetter ferguson" and "cape cod," and frequency/severity models. loss development methods utilize the actual loss development patterns from prior accident years updated through the current year to project the reported losses to an ultimate basis for all accident years. we also use this information to update our current accident year loss selections. loss development methods are generally most appropriate for lines of business that exhibit a stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next, and for which the components of the product line have similar development characteristics. expected loss ratio methods rely on the application of an expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the product line of business to determine the liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses. we generally use expected loss ratio methods in cases where the reported loss data lacked sufficient credibility to utilize loss development methods, such as for new product lines of business or for long-tail product lines at early stages of loss development. frequency/severity models may be used where sufficient frequency counts are available to apply such approaches.
a key advantage of loss development methods is that they respond more quickly to any actual changes in loss costs for the product line of business. therefore, if loss experience is unexpectedly deteriorating or improving, the loss development method gives full credibility to the changing experience. expected loss ratio methods would be slower to respond to the change, as they would continue to give more weight to a prior expected loss ratio, until enough evidence emerged to modify the expected loss ratio to reflect the changing loss experience. on the other hand, loss development methods have the disadvantage of overreacting to changes in reported losses if the loss experience is anomalous due to the various key factors described above and the inherent volatility in some of the lines. for example, the presence or absence of large losses at the early stages of loss development could cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable or unfavorable experience by assuming it is a fundamental shift in the development pattern. in these instances, expected loss ratio methods such as bornhuetter ferguson have the advantage of recognizing large losses without extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported portion of the losses for the accident year.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates the cape cod method is a hybrid between the loss development and bornhuetter ferguson methods, where the historic loss data and loss development factor assumptions are used to determine the expected loss ratio estimate in the bornhuetter ferguson method.
where appropriate, supplemental analysis for the given line of business may be performed in addition to the above described techniques such as shareholder class action suit analysis for directors and officers (d&o) coverages.
frequency/severity methods generally rely on the determination of an ultimate number of claims and an average severity for each claim for each accident year. multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claims for each accident year by the expected average severity of each claim produces the estimated ultimate loss for the accident year. frequency/severity methods generally require a sufficient volume of claims in order for the average severity to be predictable. average severity for subsequent accident years is generally determined by applying an estimated annual loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from prior accident years. in certain cases, a structural approach may also be used to predict the ultimate loss cost. frequency/severity methods have the advantage that ultimate claim counts can generally be estimated more quickly and accurately than can ultimate losses. thus, if the average claim severity can be accurately estimated, these methods can more quickly respond to changes in loss experience than other methods. however, for average severity to be predictable, the product line of business must consist of homogenous types of claims for which loss severity trends from one year to the next are reasonably consistent and where there are limited changes to deductible levels or limits. generally these methods work best for high frequency, low severity product lines of business such as personal auto. however, frequency and severity metrics are also used to test the reasonability of results for other product lines of business and provide indications of underlying trends in the data. in addition, ultimate claim counts can be used as an alternative exposure measure to earned premiums in the cape cod method.
the estimation of liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental pollution losses on insurance policies written many years ago is typically subject to greater uncertainty than other types of losses. this is due to inconsistent court decisions, as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies or have expanded theories of liability. in addition, reinsurance recoverable balances relating to asbestos and environmental loss reserves are subject to greater uncertainty due to the underlying age of the claim, underlying legal issues surrounding the nature of the coverage, and determination of proper policy period. for these reasons, these balances tend to be subject to increased levels of disputes and legal collection activity when actually billed. the insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures.
we continue to receive claims asserting injuries and damages from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. the vast majority of these asbestos and environmental losses emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. commencing in 1985, standard policies contained absolute exclusions for pollution-related damage and asbestos. the current environmental policies that we specifically price and underwrite for environmental risks on a claims-made basis have been excluded from the analysis. nevertheless, most of these legacy exposures have been heavily reinsured with very highly rated reinsurers.
the majority of our remaining exposures for asbestos and environmental losses are related to excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity amounts, with litigation expenses included within the limits of the liability we incur. individual significant loss reserves, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case-by-case basis.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates key assumptions of our actuarial methods by line of business line of business or category                       key assumptions u.s. workers'compensation                          we generally use a combination of loss development and expected loss ratio methods for u.s. workers' compensation as this is a long-tail line of business. the tail factor is typically the most critical assumption, and small changes in the selected tail factor can have a material effect on our carried reserves. for example, the tail factors beyond twenty years for guaranteed cost business could vary by 1 percentage point below to 2.5 percentage points above those indicated in the 2023 detailed valuation review. for excess of deductible business, in our judgment, it is reasonably possible that tail factors beyond twenty years could vary by 1.5 percentage points below to 3 percentage points above those indicated in the 2023 detailed valuation review.
u.s. excess casualty                               we utilize various loss cost trend assumptions for different segments of the portfolio. in our judgment, after evaluating the historical loss cost trends from prior accident years since the early 1990s, it is reasonably possible that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year-end 2023 detailed valuation review for u.s. excess casualty may range 5 percentage points lower or higher than this estimated loss trend. the loss cost trend assumption is critical for the u.s. excess casualty line of business due to the long-tail nature of the losses, and it is applied across many accident years. thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years (the expected loss ratio years) to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends that were initially relied upon in setting the loss reserves. these changes in loss trends could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.u.s. excess casualty is a long-tail line of business and any deviation in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. mass tort claims in particular may develop over a very extended period and impact multiple accident years, so we usually select a separate pattern for them. thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves. in our judgment, after evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, it is reasonably possible that the actual loss development factors could vary by an amount equivalent to a six month shift from those actually utilized in the year-end 2023 detailed valuation review. this would impact projections both for accident years where the selections were directly based on loss development methods as well as the a priori loss ratio assumptions for accident years with selections based on bornhuetter ferguson or cape cod methods. similar to loss cost trends, these changes in loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.given the very long-tail nature of this business, the tail factor selection can also have material impact on our carried reserves. the sensitivity around tail selection may also be a proxy for the sensitivity of a calendar year impact of monetary inflation on unpaid losses. it is reasonably possible for the tail factors for excess casualty could vary by 2 percentage points below to 3.5 percentage points above those indicated in the 2023 detailed valuation review.
u.s. other casualty                                the key assumptions for other casualty lines are similar to u.s. excess casualty, as the underlying business is long-tailed and can be subject to variability in loss cost trends and changes in loss development factors. these may differ significantly by line of business as coverages such as general liability, medical malpractice and environmental may be subject to different risk drivers.
u.s. financial lines                               the loss cost trends for u.s. d&amp;o liability business vary by year and subset. after evaluating the historical loss cost levels from prior accident years since the early 1990s, including the potential effect of losses relating to the credit crisis, in our judgment, it is reasonably possible that the actual variation in loss cost levels for these subsets could vary by approximately 10 percentage points lower or higher on a year-over-year basis than the assumptions actually utilized in the year-end 2023 reserve review. because the u.s. d&amp;o business has exhibited highly volatile loss trends from one accident year to the next, there is the possibility of an exceptionally high deviation. in our analysis, the effects of loss cost trend assumptions affect the results through the a priori loss ratio assumptions used for the bornhuetter ferguson and cape cod methods, which impact the projections for the more recent accident years.the selected loss development factors are also an important assumption, but are less critical than for u.s. excess casualty. because these lines are written on a claims made basis, the loss reporting and development tail is much shorter than for u.s. excess casualty. however, the high severity nature of the losses does create the potential for significant deviations in loss development patterns from one year to the next. similar to u.s. excess casualty, after evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably possible that actual loss development factors could change by an amount equivalent to a shift by six months from those actually utilized in the year-end 2023 reserve review.
u.s. and uk/europeproperty and specialrisks        for shorter-tail lines such as property and special risks, variance in outcomes for individual large claims or events typically has a greater impact on results than does changes in actuarial assumptions or methodology. this is because a greater proportion of the ultimate loss, at any stage of development, is composed of reported losses than ibnr reserves. these outcomes generally relate to unique characteristics of events such as catastrophes or losses with significant business interruption claims.
u.s., uk/europe and                                personal insurance is short-tailed in nature similar to property and special risks but less volatile. variance in estimates can result from unique events such as catastrophes. in addition, some subsets of this business, such as auto liability, can be impacted by changes in loss development factors and loss cost trends.
japan personal insurance aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates the following sensitivity analysis table summarizes the effect on the loss reserve position of using certain alternative loss cost trend (for accident years where we use expected loss ratio methods) or loss development factor assumptions rather than the assumptions actually used in determining our estimates in the year-end loss reserve analyses in 2023:

future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts long-duration traditional products primarily include whole life insurance, term life insurance, and certain payout annuities for which the payment period is life-contingent, which include certain of our single premium immediate annuities including pension risk transfer (prt) and structured settlements. in addition, these products also include accident and health, and long-term care (ltc) insurance. the ltc block is in run-off and has been fully reinsured with fortitude re.
updating net premiums ratios (nprs) - remeasurement gains and losses: generally, future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future benefits less the present value of future net premiums (portion of the gross premium required to provide for all benefits and expenses). the assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities are initially set when a policy is issued and an npr is established. benefit liabilities are subsequently remeasured periodically to reflect changes in policy assumptions and actual versus expected experience and are recognized as remeasurement gains and losses, a component of policyholder benefits. the assumptions include mortality, morbidity and persistency. these assumptions are typically consistent with pricing inputs at policy issuance. liabilities are accreted using an upper-medium grade (low credit risk) fixed income instrument yield that is locked-in at policy issuance. the liabilities are remeasured at the balance sheet date using a current upper-medium grade yield with changes in the liabilities reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (oci).
for universal life policies with secondary guarantees: we recognize certain liabilities in addition to policyholder account balances. for universal life policies with secondary guarantees, as well as other universal life policies for which profits followed by losses are expected at contract inception, a liability is recognized based on a benefit ratio of (a) the present value of total expected payments, in excess of the account value, over the life of the contract, divided by (b) the present value of total expected assessments over the life of the contract. universal life account balances are reported in policyholder contract deposits, while these additional liabilities related to universal life products are reported within future policy benefits in the consolidated balance sheets. these additional liabilities are also adjusted to reflect the effect of unrealized gains or losses on fixed maturity securities available for sale on accumulated assessments, with related changes recognized through other comprehensive income (loss). the policyholder behavior assumptions for these liabilities include mortality, lapses and premium persistency. the capital market assumptions used for the liability for universal life secondary guarantees include discount rates and net earned rates.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates market risk benefits annuity products offered by our individual retirement and group retirement segments offer guaranteed benefit features (collectively known as gmxbs). these guaranteed features include guaranteed minimum death benefits (gmdb) that are payable in the event of death and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (gmwb) that guarantee lifetime withdrawals regardless of fixed account and separate account value performance. for additional information on these features, see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
gmxbs are recognized as mrbs and can be assets or liabilities, and represent the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account value, with changes in fair value of mrbs recognized in the consolidated statements of income (loss) and the portion of the fair value change attributable to our own credit risk recognized in oci.
our exposure to the guaranteed amounts is equal to the amount by which the contract holder's account balance is below the amount provided by the guaranteed feature. a deferred annuity contract may include more than one type of gmxb; for example, it may have both a gmdb and a gmwb. however, a policyholder can generally only receive payout from one guaranteed feature on a contract containing a death benefit and a living benefit, i.e., the features are generally mutually exclusive (except a surviving spouse who has a rider to potentially collect both a gmdb upon their spouse's death and a gmwb during his or her lifetime). a policyholder cannot purchase more than one living benefit on one contract. declines in the equity markets, increased volatility and a low interest rate environment generally increase our exposure to potential benefits under the guaranteed features, leading to an increase in the liabilities for those benefits.

guaranteed benefitfeature        reserving methodology &amp;key assumptions fair value methodology           guaranteed minimum benefits on annuity products are market risk benefits that are required to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value of the liabilities recorded in changes in the fair value of market risk benefits, except for changes related to the company's own credit risk which are recorded in aoci. the fair value of these benefits is based on assumptions that a market participant would use in valuing these mrbs.the company applies a non-option-based approach for variable products, and an option-based approach for fixed index and fixed products. under the non-option-based approach, a portion of actual fees (i.e., attributed fees) is determined such that the present value of expected benefits less attributed fees is zero at issue. this calculated ratio is locked in and utilized in each policy valuation going forward and results in an mrb value of zero at policy issue. under the option-based approach, the mrb value at issue represents the present value of expected benefits after account value exhaustion. there is no calculated attributed fee ratio under this approach; as such, the calculated mrb liability at inception requires an equal and offsetting adjustment to the underlying host contract. consistent with the non-option-based approach, this results in no gains or losses recognized upon policy issuance. the fair value of the market risk benefits, which are level 3 assets and liabilities, is based on a risk-neutral framework and incorporates actuarial and capital market assumptions related to projected cash flows over the expected lives of the contracts. for additional information on how we value for mrbs, see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, and for information on fair value measurement of these mrbs, including how we incorporate our own non-performance risk, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
keyassumptions                   key assumptions include:•interest rates;•equity market returns;•market volatility;•credit spreads;•equity / interest rate correlation;•policyholder behavior, including mortality, lapses, withdrawals and benefit utilization. estimates of future policyholder behavior are subject to judgment and based primarily on our historical experience; and•in applying asset growth assumptions for the valuation of mrbs, we use market-consistent assumptions calibrated to observable interest rate and equity option prices.for the fixed index annuity gmxb liability, policyholder funds are projected assuming growth equal to current option values for the current crediting period followed by option budgets for all subsequent crediting periods. policyholder fund growth projected assuming credited rates are expected to be maintained at a target pricing spread, subject to guaranteed minimums.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates valuation of embedded derivatives for fixed index annuity and index universal life products fixed index annuity and life products provide growth potential based in part on the performance of market indices. certain fixed index annuity products offer optional guaranteed benefit features similar to those offered on variable annuity products. policyholders may elect to rebalance among the various accounts within the product at specified renewal dates. at the end of each index term, we generally have the opportunity to re-price the index component by establishing different participation rates or caps on index credited rates. the index crediting feature of these products results in the recognition of an embedded derivative that is required to be bifurcated from the host contract and carried at fair value with changes in the fair value of the liabilities recorded in net realized gains (losses). option pricing models are used to estimate fair value, taking into account assumptions for future index growth rates, volatility of the index, future interest rates, and our ability to adjust the participation rate and the cap on index credited rates in light of market conditions and policyholder behavior assumptions.

the following table summarizes the sensitivity of changes in certain assumptions for mrbs, liability for future policyholder benefits, net of reinsurance and embedded derivatives related to index-linked interest credited features, measured as the related hypothetical impact for the december 31, 2023 balances and the resulting hypothetical impact on pre-tax income and oci, before hedging:
increase (decrease) due to changes in mrbs, liability for future policyholder benefits, and embedded derivatives related to index-linked interest credited features pre-tax        other income         comprehensive income (loss)
equity return(a)
the sensitivities of 20 percent and one percent are included for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect the changes in net investment spreads, equity return, volatility, interest rate, mortality or lapse used by aig in its fair value analyses to value other applicable liabilities. changes different from those illustrated may occur in any period and by different products.
the change in pre-tax income due to variances in equity returns or interest rates reflects the impact to mrbs using the at-issue non-performance risk adjustment (npa) and the change in embedded derivatives related to index-linked interest credit features. the change in oci due to equity returns solely reflects the impact on mrbs due to changes in the npa, while the change in oci due to interest rates also reflects the impact to the liability for future policyholder benefits, net of reinsurance.
the analysis of mrbs and embedded derivatives is a dynamic process that considers all relevant factors and assumptions described above. we estimate each of the above factors individually, without the effect of any correlation among the key assumptions. an assessment of sensitivity associated with changes in any single assumption would not necessarily be an indicator of future results. the effects on pre-tax income in the sensitivity analysis table above do not reflect the related effects from our economic hedging program, which utilizes derivative and other financial instruments and is designed so that changes in value of those instruments move in the opposite direction of changes in the guaranteed benefit mrbs and embedded derivative liabilities.

aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates reinsurance assets in the ordinary course of business, our insurance companies may use both treaty and facultative reinsurance to minimize their net loss exposure to any single catastrophic loss event or to an accumulation of losses from a number of smaller events or to provide greater diversification of our businesses. reinsurance assets include the balances due from reinsurance and insurance companies under the terms of our reinsurance agreements for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and benefits paid and unpaid. the estimation of reinsurance recoverables involves a significant amount of judgment. reinsurance assets include reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses that are estimated as part of our loss reserving process and, consequently, are subject to similar judgments and uncertainties as the estimation of gross loss reserves. for additional information on reinsurance, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. a qualitative assessment may be performed, considering whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an operating segment is less than its carrying value. if management elects to perform a quantitative assessment to determine recoverability of carrying value or is compelled to do so based on the results of a qualitative assessment, the estimate of fair value involves applying one or a combination of common valuation approaches. these include discounted expected future cash flows, market-based earnings multiples and external appraisals, among other methods, all of which require management judgment and are subject to uncertainty, primarily as it relates to assumptions around business growth, earnings projections, and cost of capital.
for additional information on goodwill impairment, see part i, item 1a. risk factors - estimates and assumptions and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
allowance for credit losses on certain investments we maintain an allowance for the expected lifetime credit losses of commercial and residential mortgage loans and available for sale securities. the sufficiency of this allowance is reviewed quarterly using both quantitative and qualitative considerations, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. these considerations and the overall methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses are discussed in more detail in note 6 and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for available for sale securities and commercial and residential loans, respectively.
fair value measurements of certain financial assets and financial liabilities assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are measured and classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three levels based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair value. we classify fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities as level 3 when they require significant unobservable inputs in their valuation. we consider unobservable inputs to be those for which market data is not available. our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an asset or liability requires judgment.
for additional information about the valuation methodologies of financial instruments measured at fair value, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes deferred income taxes represent the tax effect of the differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. our assessment of net deferred income taxes represents management's best estimate of the tax consequences of various events and transactions, which can themselves be based on other accounting estimates, resulting in incremental uncertainty in the estimation process.
deferred tax asset recoverability the evaluation of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. the weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. as such, changes in tax laws in countries where we transact business can impact our deferred tax asset valuation allowance. we consider multiple factors to reliably estimate future taxable income so we can determine the extent of our ability to realize net operating losses, foreign tax credits, realized capital loss and other carryforwards. these factors include forecasts of future income for each of our businesses, which incorporate forecasts of future statutory income for our insurance companies, and actual and planned business and operational changes, both of which include assumptions about future macroeconomic and aig-specific conditions and events. we subject the aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates forecasts to stresses of key assumptions and evaluate the effect on tax attribute utilization. we also apply stresses to our assumptions about the effectiveness of relevant prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. in performing our assessment of recoverability, we consider tax laws governing the utilization of net operating loss, capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards in each applicable jurisdiction. these tax laws are subject to change, resulting in incremental uncertainty in our assessment of recoverability.
uncertain tax positions uncertain tax positions represent aig's liability for income taxes on tax years subject to review by the internal revenue service (irs) or other tax authorities. we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, based on technical merits, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recognized in the financial statements. a tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement. the completion of review, or the expiration of federal statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the liability for income taxes.
for a discussion of our framework for assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and other tax topics, see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.

adoption of targeted improvements to the accounting for long-duration contracts in august 2018, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued an accounting standard update with the objective of making targeted improvements to the existing recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements for long-duration contracts issued by an insurance entity.
the company adopted the targeted improvements to the accounting for long-duration contracts (the standard or ldti) on january 1, 2023, with a transition date of january 1, 2021 (as described in additional detail below).
the company adopted the standard using the modified retrospective transition method relating to liabilities for traditional and limited payment contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs associated therewith, while the company adopted the standard in relation to mrbs on a retrospective basis. based upon this transition method, as of the january 1, 2021 transition date (transition date), the impact of the adoption of the standard was a net decrease to beginning aoci of $2.2 billion and a net increase to beginning retained earnings of $933 million.
•the reclassification of the cumulative effect of non-performance adjustments related to our products in individual retirement and group retirement operating segments that are currently measured at fair value (e.g., living benefit guarantees associated with variable annuities), partially offset by:
•a reduction from the difference between the fair value and carrying value of benefits not previously measured at fair value (e.g., death benefit guarantees associated with variable annuities).
•changes to the discount rate which will most significantly impact our life insurance and institutional markets segments, partially offset by:
•the removal of deferred policy acquisition costs, unearned revenue reserves, sales inducement assets and certain future policyholder benefit balances recorded in aoci related to changes in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | executive summary regulatory, industry and economic factors russia/ukraine conflict the russia/ukraine conflict began in february 2022. the conflict has and may continue to have a significant impact on the global macroeconomic and geopolitical environments, including increased volatility in capital and commodity markets, rapid changes to regulatory conditions around the globe including the use of sanctions, operational challenges for multinational corporations, inflationary pressures and an increased risk of cybersecurity incidents.
the conflict is evolving and has the potential to adversely affect our business and results of operations from an investment, underwriting and operational perspective. while we believe we have taken appropriate actions to minimize related risk, we continue to monitor potential exposure and operational impacts, as well as any actual and potential claims activity. the ultimate impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including scope, severity and duration, the governmental, legislative and regulatory actions taken (including the application of sanctions), and court decisions, if any, rendered in response to those actions.
impact of changes in the interest rate environment and equity markets certain key u.s. benchmark rates continued to rise during 2023 as markets reacted to heightened inflation measures, geopolitical risk, and the board of governors of the federal reserve system implementing multiple increases to short term interest rates. the yield pick of new investments over sales, maturities and paydowns and redemptions, excluding fortitude re, averaged 195 basis points during 2023. this combined with resetting of coupon rates on floating rate securities and loans has steadily improved the overall portfolio yields. however, the key benchmark rates remain highly volatile. we actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio construction and asset-liability management, including spread management strategies for our investment-oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities, but we may not be able to fully mitigate our interest rate risk by matching exposure of our assets relative to our liabilities.
equity markets our financial results are impacted by the performance of equity markets, which impacts the performance of our alternative investment portfolio, fee income and net amount at risk. for instance, in our variable annuity separate accounts, mutual fund assets and brokerage and advisory assets, we generally earn fee income based on the account value, which fluctuates with the equity markets as a significant amount of these assets are invested in equity funds. the impact of equity market returns, both increases and decreases, is reflected in our results due to the impact on the account value and the fair values of equity-exposed securities.
in life and retirement, hedging costs could also be significantly impacted by changes in the level of equity markets as rebalancing and option costs are tied to the equity market volatility. these hedging costs are partially offset by our rider fees that are tied to the level of the chicago board options exchange volatility index. as rebalancing and option costs increase or decrease, the rider fees will increase or decrease partially offsetting the hedging costs incurred.
market and other economic factors may result in increased credit impairments, downgrades and losses across single or numerous asset classes due to lower collateral values or deteriorating cash flow and profitability by borrowers could lead to higher defaults on our investment portfolio, especially in geographic, industry or investment sectors where we have higher concentrations of exposure, such as real estate related borrowings. these factors can also cause widening of credit spreads which could reduce investment asset valuations, decrease fee income and increase statutory capital requirements, as well as reduce the availability of investments that are attractive from a risk-adjusted perspective.
alternative investments include private equity funds which are generally reported on a one-quarter lag. accordingly, changes in valuations driven by equity market conditions during the fourth quarter of 2023 may impact the private equity investments in the alternative investments portfolio in the first quarter of 2024.
annuity sales and surrenders the rising rate environment and our partnership with blackstone inc. and its investment advisory affiliates (blackstone) have provided a strong tailwind for fixed and fixed index annuity sales, however, higher interest rates have also resulted in an increase in surrenders. rising interest rates could continue to create the potential for increased sales, but could also drive higher surrenders relative to what we have already experienced. fixed annuities have surrender charge periods, generally in the three-to-seven year range. fixed index annuities have surrender charge periods, generally in the five-to-ten year range, and within our group retirement segment, certain of our fixed investment options are subject to other withdrawal restrictions, which may help mitigate increased early surrenders in a rising rate environment. in addition, older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to contract holders have driven better than expected persistency in fixed annuities, although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio. we closely monitor surrenders of fixed annuities as contracts with lower minimum interest rates come out of the surrender charge period.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | executive summary reinvestment and spread management we actively monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. we also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in-force business. business strategies continue to evolve and we attempt to maintain profitability of the overall business in light of the interest rate environment. a rising interest rate environment results in improved yields on new investments and improves margins for our life and retirement business while also making certain products, such as fixed annuities, more attractive to potential customers. however, the rising rate environment has resulted in lower values on general and separate account assets, mutual fund assets and brokerage and advisory assets that hold investments in fixed income assets.
for additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies, see investments.
for investment-oriented products, including universal life insurance, and variable, fixed and fixed index annuities, in our individual retirement, group retirement, life insurance and institutional markets businesses, our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business, modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads, using asset-liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable, and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. renewal crediting rate management is guided by specific contract provisions designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. we expect to continue to adjust crediting rates on in-force business, as appropriate, to be responsive to changing rate environments. as interest rates rise, we may need to raise crediting rates on in-force business for competitive and other reasons, potentially offsetting a portion of the additional investment income resulting from investing in a higher interest rate environment.
of the aggregate fixed account values of our individual retirement and group retirement annuity products, 54 percent were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate as of december 31, 2023. the percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent were 50 percent and 55 percent as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. in the universal life products in our life insurance business, 59 percent and 62 percent of the account values were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. these businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to manage the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales in the context of regulatory requirements and competitive positioning.
general insurance our net investment income is significantly impacted by market interest rates as well as the deployment of asset allocation strategies to manage duration, enhance yield and manage interest rate risk. as interest rates increase, so too does our ability to reinvest future cash inflows from premiums, as well as sales and maturities of existing investments, at more favorable rates. for additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies, see investments.
while the impact of rising interest rates on our general insurance segment increases the benefit of investment income, the current and medium-term inflationary environment may also translate into higher loss cost trends. we monitor these trends closely, particularly loss cost trend uncertainty, to ensure that not only our pricing, but also our loss reserving assumptions are proactive to, and considerate of, current and future economic conditions.
for our general insurance segment loss reserves, rising interest rates may favorably impact the statutory net loss reserve discount for workers' compensation and its associated amortization.
impact of currency volatility currency volatility remains acute. strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the euro, british pound and the japanese yen (the major currencies) impacts income for our businesses with substantial international operations. in particular, growth trends in net premiums written reported in u.s. dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies. the net effect on underwriting results, however, is significantly mitigated, as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected.
these currencies may continue to fluctuate, especially as a result of central bank responses to inflation, concerns regarding future economic growth and other macroeconomic factors, and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in u.s. dollars, as well as financial statement line item comparability.

•a decrease in net realized gains excluding fortitude re funds withheld assets and embedded derivative of $2.4 billion, driven by a $2.3 billion decrease in derivative and hedge activity and gains on index-linked interest credited embedded derivatives, net of related hedges.
•an increase in net investment income of $2.8 billion primarily driven by higher income on available for sale fixed maturity securities of $2.0 billion and an increase in the fair value of fixed maturity securities where we elected the fair value option of $1.2 billion as a result of the higher interest rate environment and an increase in interest income on mortgages and other loans of $525 million, partially offset by lower returns on our alternative investments of $670 million;
•an increase in underwriting income in general insurance of $301 million, reflecting lower catastrophe losses and premium growth with improvement in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, primarily driven by changes in business mix along with continued positive rate change, focused risk selection and improved terms and conditions partially offset by lower net favorable prior year reserve development and higher expense ratio;

aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | consolidated results of operations years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 comparison net income (loss) attributable to aig common shareholders decreased $140 million due to the following, on a pre-tax basis:
•lower net gains on divestitures and other due to loss of $82 million in 2022 compared with net gains on divestitures and other in 2021 due to the recognition of $3.0 billion gain from the sale of the affordable housing portfolio and $102 million gain from the sale of certain assets of the retail mutual funds business in 2021;
•lower net investment income of $2.8 billion primarily driven by lower returns on our alternative investments of $1.9 billion and declines in fair value of fixed maturity securities where we elected the fair value option of $810 million as a result of the higher rate environment and negative equity market performance;
•a decrease in net realized gains excluding fortitude re funds withheld assets and embedded derivative of $1.8 billion, driven by losses on sales of securities of $1.1 billion and sales of alternative investments and real estate of $795 million, unfavorable movement in the allowance for credit losses on fixed maturity securities and loans of $421 million and absence of realized gains related to affordable housing portfolio sale in 2021 of $219 million, partially offset by a $856 million increase in derivative and hedge activity and gains on index-linked interest credited embedded derivatives, net of related hedges;
•a decrease in net realized gains on fortitude re funds withheld assets of $1.5 billion driven by losses on sales of available for sale fixed maturity securities of $1.0 billion and sales of alternative investments of $194 million and $162 million decrease in derivative and hedge activity; and
•higher income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $507 million driven by the sale of 9.9 percent interest of corebridge to blackstone in december 2021 and the 12.4 percent initial public offering (ipo) of corebridge in september 2022.
•an increase in net realized gains on fortitude re funds withheld embedded derivative of $8.1 billion driven by interest rate movements;
•higher underwriting income in general insurance of $1.1 billion, including $86 million attributable to eliminating the international reporting lag, reflecting the continued earn-in of positive rate change, strong renewal retentions and new business production, as well as increased favorable prior year development and lower catastrophe losses. underwriting income was negatively impacted by unfavorable movements in foreign exchange. for additional information on the elimination of the international reporting lag, see note 1 to the to the consolidated financial statements; and
•lower interest expense of $180 million primarily driven by interest savings of $225 million from $9.4 billion debt repurchases, through cash tender offers and debt redemptions in 2022 as well as $92 million from $3.6 billion of debt repurchases, through cash tender offers and debt redemptions in 2021, as well as interest savings of $100 million on debt borrowing due to the sale of affordable housing in 2021. these decreases are partially offset by interest expense of $240 million on $6.5 billion corebridge senior unsecured notes, $1.5 billion draw down on the corebridge 3-year delayed draw term loan agreement (the ddtl facility) and $1.0 billion junior subordinated debt issued by corebridge in 2022.

competition and challenges life and retirement operates in the highly competitive insurance and financial services industry in the u.s. and select international markets, competing against various financial services companies, including banks and other life insurance and mutual fund companies. competition is primarily based on product pricing and design, distribution, financial strength, customer service and ease of doing business.
our business remains competitive due to its long-standing market leading positions, innovative products, distribution relationships across multiple channels, customer-focused service and strong financial ratings.
•managing a rising rate environment. while a rising rate environment improves yields on new investment, improves margins on our business, and increases sales in certain products such as fixed annuities, it may also result in increased competition for certain products resulting in a need to increase crediting rates, and has resulted in lower separate account asset values for investments in fixed income which has reduced fee income;
•increased competition in our primary markets, including aggressive pricing of annuities by competitors, increased competition and consolidation of employer groups in the group retirement planning market, and competitors with different profitability targets in the pension risk transfer space as well as other product lines;
•upgrading our technology and underwriting processes while managing general operating expenses.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | life and retirement industry and economic factors individual retirement increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs are leading americans to seek additional financial security as they approach retirement. the strong demand for fixed index and fixed annuities with guaranteed living benefit features has attracted increased competition in this product space. in response to the ever changing interest rate environment we have developed guaranteed living benefits for variable, fixed index and fixed annuities with margins that are less sensitive to the level of interest rates. changes in the capital markets (interest rate environment, credit spreads, equity markets, volatility) can have a significant impact on sales, surrender rates, investment returns, guaranteed income features, and net investment spreads in the annuity industry.
group retirement group retirement competes in the defined contribution market under the retirement services brand. retirement services is a leading retirement plan provider in the u.s. for k-12 schools and school districts, higher education, healthcare, government and other not-for-profit institutions. the defined contribution market is a highly efficient and competitive market that requires support for both plan sponsors and individual participants. to meet this challenge, retirement services is investing in a client- focused technology platform to support improved compliance and self-service functionality. retirement services' model pairs self-service tools with its employee financial advisors who provide individual plan participants with enrollment support and comprehensive financial planning services.
changes in the interest rates, credit spreads and equity market environment can have a significant impact on investment returns, fee income, advisory and other income, guaranteed income features, and net investment spreads, and a moderate impact on sales and surrender rates.
life insurance consumers have a significant need for life insurance, whether it is used for income replacement for their surviving family, estate planning or wealth transfer. additionally, consumers use life insurance to provide living benefits in case of chronic, critical or terminal illnesses, and to supplement retirement income.
in response to consumer needs and a changing interest rate environment, our life insurance product portfolio will continue to promote products with less long-duration interest rate risk and mitigate exposure to products that have long-duration interest rate risk through sales levels and hedging strategies.
as life insurance ownership remains at historical lows in the u.s., efforts to expand the reach and increase the affordability of life insurance are critical. the industry is investing in consumer-centric efforts to reduce traditional barriers to securing life protection by simplifying the sales and service experience. digitally enabled processes and tools provide a fast, friendly and simple path to life insurance protection.
institutional markets institutional markets serves a variety of needs for corporate clients. demand is driven by a number of factors including the macroeconomic and regulatory environment. we expect to see continued growth in the pension risk transfer market (direct and assumed reinsurance) as corporate plan sponsors look to transfer asset or liability, longevity, administrative and operational risks associated with their defined benefit plans.
changes in interest rates and credit spreads can have a significant impact on investment returns and net investment spreads, impacting organic growth opportunities.

aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | investments investments overview our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each segment by targeting an asset allocation mix that supports estimated cash flows of our outstanding liabilities and provides diversification from an asset class, sector, issuer, and geographic perspective. the primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus. the majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities.
inflation remains elevated relative to the federal reserve target however it has decreased over the past several quarters. interest rates also remain elevated although credit spreads have narrowed for most asset classes as recession concerns began to recede and the likelihood for a soft landing increased.
our investment management agreements with blackstone inc.
in 2021, aig entered into a long-term asset management relationship with blackstone inc. and its investment advisory affiliates (blackstone), pursuant to which blackstone initially managed $50 billion of corebridge's existing investment portfolio, with that amount increasing to an aggregate of $92.5 billion by the third quarter of 2027. as of december 31, 2023, blackstone manages $55 billion in book value of assets in corebridge's investment portfolio. as these assets run-off, we expect blackstone to reinvest primarily in blackstone-originated investments across a range of asset classes, including private and structured credit, and commercial and residential real estate securitized and whole loans. we continue to manage asset allocation and portfolio-level risk management decisions with respect to any assets managed by blackstone, ensuring that we maintain a consistent level of oversight across our entire investment portfolio considering our asset-liability matching needs, risk appetite and capital positions.
our investment management agreements with blackrock, inc.
since april 2022, aig and corebridge insurance company subsidiaries have entered into separate investment management agreements with blackrock, inc. and its investment advisory affiliates (blackrock). substantially all investment management agreements contemplated for aig insurance company subsidiaries have been executed. a small number of insurance companies remain under discussion and expect to be resolved in 2024. as of december 31, 2023, blackrock manages $135 billion of our investment portfolio, consisting of liquid fixed income and certain private placement assets, including $76 billion of corebridge assets. in addition, liquid fixed income assets associated with the fortitude re funds withheld asset portfolio were separately transferred to blackrock for management in 2022.
for additional information, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
•blended investment yields on new investments are higher than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called during this period. we continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities with attractive risk-adjusted return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income.•the higher interest rate environment has contributed to higher income in the base portfolio for the twelve months ended december 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. total net investment income increased for the twelve months ended december 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher returns in our fixed maturity securities, mortgage and other loans, short-term investments and hedge fund portfolios, partially offset by lower income in our private equity portfolio.
investment strategies investment strategies are assessed at the segment level and involve considerations that include local and general market and economic conditions, duration and cash flow management, risk appetite and volatility constraints, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, tax, regulatory and legal investment limitations, and, as applicable, environmental, social and governance considerations.
•our fundamental strategy across the portfolios is to seek investments with similar duration and cash flow characteristics to the associated insurance liabilities to the extent practicable.
•we seek to purchase investments that offer enhanced yield through illiquidity premiums, such as private placements and commercial mortgage loans, which also add portfolio diversification. these assets typically afford credit protections through covenants, ability to customize structures that meet our insurance liability needs, and deeper due diligence given information access.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | investments
•given our global presence, we seek investments that provide diversification from investments available in local markets. to the extent we purchase these investments, we generally hedge any currency risk using derivatives, which could provide opportunities to earn higher risk adjusted returns compared to investments in the functional currency.
•aig parent, included in other operations, actively manages its assets and liabilities, counterparties and duration. aig parent's liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash and short-term investments. this strategy allows us to both diversify our sources of liquidity and reduce the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.
•within the u.s., the life and retirement and general insurance investments are generally split between reserve backing and surplus portfolios.
-insurance reserves are backed mainly by investment grade fixed maturity securities that meet our duration, risk-return, capital, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives. we assess asset classes based on their fundamental underlying risk factors, including credit (public and private), commercial real estate and residential real estate, regardless of whether such investments are bonds, loans, or structured products.
-surplus investments seek to enhance portfolio returns and are generally comprised of a mix of fixed maturity investment grade and below investment grade securities and various alternative asset classes, including private equity, real estate equity, and hedge funds. over the past few years, hedge fund investments have been reduced.
•outside of the u.s., fixed maturity securities held by our insurance companies consist primarily of investment-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.
•we also utilize derivatives to manage our asset and liability duration as well as currency exposures.
asset-liability management the investment strategy within the general insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus, maintenance of sufficient liquidity for unanticipated insurance claims, and preservation of capital. general insurance invests primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans. fixed maturity securities of the general insurance companies have an average duration of 3.9 years, with an average of 4.1 years for north america and 3.5 years for international.
while invested assets backing reserves of the general insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional liquid fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate to asset classes that offer higher yields through structural and illiquidity premiums, particularly in our north america operations. in addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset-backed investments to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates and inflation. we seek to diversify the portfolio across asset classes, sectors and issuers to mitigate idiosyncratic portfolio risks.
in addition, a portion of the surplus of general insurance companies is invested in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments that seek to balance liquidity, volatility and growth of surplus. although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio.
the investment strategy of the life and retirement companies is to provide net investment income to back liabilities that result in stable distributable earnings and enhance portfolio value, subject to asset-liability management, capital, liquidity and regulatory constraints.
the life and retirement companies use asset-liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. the life and retirement companies maintain a diversified, high-to-medium quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans that, to the extent practicable, match the duration characteristics of the liabilities. we seek to diversify the portfolio across asset classes, sectors, and issuers to mitigate idiosyncratic portfolio risks. the investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, duration varies between distinct portfolios. the interest rate environment has a direct impact on the asset-liability management profile of the businesses, and changes in the interest rate environment may result in the need to lengthen or shorten the duration of the portfolio. in a rising rate environment, we may shorten the duration of the investment portfolio.
fixed maturity securities of the life and retirement companies' domestic operations have an average duration of 6.9 years.
in addition, the life and retirement companies seek to enhance surplus portfolio returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved returns in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio returns.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | investments national association of insurance commissioners (naic) designations of fixed maturity securities the securities valuation office (svo) of the naic evaluates the investments of u.s. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called naic designations. in general, naic designations of '1' highest quality, or '2' high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while naic designations of '3' through '6' generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade. naic designations for non-agency residential mortgage backed securities (rmbs) and commercial mortgage backed securities (cmbs) are calculated using third party modeling results provided through the naic. these methodologies result in an improved naic designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. the following tables summarize the ratings distribution of aig subsidiaries' fixed maturity security portfolio by naic designation, and the distribution by composite aig credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies. for fixed maturity securities where no naic designation is assigned or able to be calculated using third-party data, the naic designation category used in the first table below reflects an internal rating.

net realized gains (losses) on fortitude re funds withheld assets primarily reflect changes in the valuation of the modified coinsurance and funds withheld assets. increases in the valuation of these assets result in losses to aig as the appreciation on the assets under those reinsurance arrangements must be transferred to fortitude re. decreases in valuation of the assets result in gains to aig as the depreciation on the assets under those reinsurance arrangements must be transferred to fortitude re. for additional information on the impact of the funds withheld arrangements with fortitude re, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

significant reinsurance agreements in the first quarter of 2017, we entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with nico, under which we transferred to nico 80 percent of the reserve risk on substantially all of our u.s. commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. under this agreement, we ceded to nico 80 percent of the losses on subject business paid on or after january 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion. we account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. this transaction resulted in a gain, which under gaap retroactive reinsurance accounting is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period. nico created a collateral trust account as security for their claim payment obligations to us, into which they deposited the consideration paid under the agreement, and berkshire hathaway inc. has provided a parental guarantee to secure nico's obligations under the agreement.

variable annuity guaranteed benefits and hedging results our individual retirement and group retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with riders that provide guaranteed benefits. the liabilities are accounted for as mrbs and measured at fair value. the fair value of the mrbs may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads, market volatility, policyholder behavior and other factors.
in addition to risk-mitigating features in our variable annuity product design, we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from gmwbs, including exposures to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. the hedging program includes all in-force gmwb policies and utilizes derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts and interest rate swap and option contracts, as well as fixed maturity securities.
for additional information on market risk management related to these product features, see enterprise risk management - insurance risks - life and retirement companies' key risks - variable annuity, fixed index annuity and index universal life risk management and hedging programs.
differences in valuation of mrbs and economic hedge target the variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our gmwb riders. the economic hedge target differs from the gaap valuation of the mrbs, creating volatility in our net income (loss) primarily due to the following:
•the hedge program is designed to offset moves in the gmwb economic liability and therefore has a lower sensitivity to equity market changes than the mrbs;
•the gaap valuation reflects those fees attributed to the mrbs, such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero. since the mrb includes gmwbs and gmdbs, these attributed fees are typically larger than just the gmwb rider fees;
•the economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for gaap valuation, such as margins for policyholder behavior, mortality, and volatility; and
•the economic hedge target excludes our own credit risk changes (non-performance adjustments) used in the gaap valuation, which are recognized in oci. the gaap valuation has different sensitivities to movements in interest rates and other market factors, and to changes from actuarial assumption updates, than the economic hedge target.
for additional information on our valuation methodology for mrbs, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | insurance reserves the market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting. in addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program, the life and retirement companies generally have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees. the primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include:
•basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns, which may be either positive or negative;
•realized volatility versus implied volatility;
•risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge.

the impact on our pre-tax income (loss) of variable annuity guaranteed benefits and related hedging results includes changes in the fair value of mrbs, and changes in the fair value of related derivative hedging instruments, and along with attributed rider fees and net of benefits associated with mrbs are together recognized in change in the fair value of mrbs, net, with the exception of our own credit risk changes, which are recognized in oci. changes in the fair value of mrbs, net are excluded from adjusted pre-tax income of individual retirement and group retirement.
the change in the fair value of the mrbs and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting, primarily due to the differences in valuation between the economic hedge target, the gaap mrbs and the fair value of the hedging portfolio, as discussed above. when corporate credit spreads widen, the change in the non-performance risk adjustment (npa) spread generally reduces the fair value of the mrbs liabilities, resulting in a gain in aoci, and when corporate credit spreads tighten, the change in the npa spread generally increases the fair value of the mrbs liabilities, resulting in a loss in aoci. in addition to changes driven by credit market-related movements in the npa spread, the npa balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits.
change in economic hedge target the increase in the economic hedge target liability in the year ended december 31, 2023 was primarily driven by higher equity markets partially offset by aging of the business and tightening credit spreads. the decrease in the economic hedge target liability in 2022 was primarily driven by higher interest rates and widening credit spreads, offset by lower equity markets.

investing cash flow activities net cash used in investing activities in the year ended december 31, 2023 was $7.0 billion compared to net cash used in investing activities of $3.6 billion in 2022 and $3.3 billion in 2021.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | liquidity and capital resources financing cash flow activities net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december 31, 2023 totaled $782 million, reflecting:
•$1.25 billion outflow from the repayment on the ddtl facility;
•$381 million in net outflows from the issuance and repayment of debt of consolidated investment entities.
net cash used in financing activities in the year ended december 31, 2022 totaled $602 million reflecting:
•$124 million paid by corebridge in the form of cash dividends to shareholders other than aig, of which $66 million paid after its ipo;
•$1.5 billion inflow from drawdown on the ddtl facility;
•$318 million in net outflows from the issuance and repayment of debt of consolidated investment entities.
net cash used in financing activities in the year ended december 31, 2021 totaled $3.7 billion reflecting:
•$156 million in net outflows from the issuance and repayment of debt of consolidated investment entities; and
•$2.2 billion in net inflows from the sale of a 9.9 percent equity interest in corebridge to an affiliate of blackstone.
liquidity and capital resources of aig parent and subsidiaries aig parent as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively, aig parent and applicable intermediate holding companies had approximately $12.1 billion and $8.2 billion in liquidity sources held in the form of cash, short-term investments and aig parent's committed, revolving syndicated credit facility of $4.5 billion. following the initial public offering, corebridge liquidity, including its loan facilities, is not reflected in aig parent's liquidity. as a public company shareholder of corebridge, aig receives its pro rata share of dividends paid by corebridge on corebridge common stock. aig parent's primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries and credit facilities. aig parent's primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, operating expenses and dividends on aig common stock and series a preferred stock.
we expect to access the debt and preferred equity markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.
we utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our insurance operations. should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic or inorganic growth opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or aig common stock repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | liquidity and capital resources insurance companies we expect that our insurance companies will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. our insurance companies' liquidity resources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.
each of our material insurance companies' liquidity is monitored through various internal liquidity risk measures. the primary sources of liquidity are premiums, fees, reinsurance recoverables and investment income and maturities. the primary uses of liquidity are paid losses, reinsurance payments, benefit claims, surrenders, withdrawals, interest payments, dividends, expenses, investment purchases and collateral requirements.
our insurance companies may require additional funding to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances. for example, large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to the affected operations of our general insurance companies, and a shift in interest rates may require us to provide support to the affected operations of our life and retirement companies.
certain of our u.s. life and retirement insurance companies are members of the fhlbs in their respective districts. our borrowings from fhlbs are non-puttable and are used to supplement liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. our u.s. life and retirement companies had $5.7 billion and $4.6 billion which were due to fhlbs in their respective districts at december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively, under funding agreements issued through our individual retirement, group retirement and institutional markets operating segments, which were reported in policyholder contract deposits. proceeds from funding agreements are generally invested in fixed income securities and other investments intended to generate spread income.
certain of our u.s. life and retirement companies have securities lending programs that lend securities from their investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. under these programs, these companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022 we had no loans outstanding under these programs.
aig parent and/or certain subsidiaries are parties to several letter of credit agreements with various financial institutions, which issue letters of credit from time to time in support of our insurance companies. these letters of credit are subject to reimbursement by aig parent and/or certain subsidiaries in the event of a drawdown of these letters of credit. letters of credit issued in support of the general insurance companies totaled approximately $2.4 billion at december 31, 2023. letters of credit issued in support of the life and retirement companies totaled approximately $151 million at december 31, 2023, which are subject to reimbursement by corebridge with no recourse to aig parent.
following the initial public offering of corebridge, aig owned less than 80 percent of corebridge common stock, resulting in the tax deconsolidation of corebridge from aig. as such, as of september 15, 2022, aig no longer receives tax sharing payments from corebridge for tax liabilities of subsequent periods. with respect to historic tax periods and tax periods prior to the tax deconsolidation of corebridge from aig, corebridge and aig will make tax payments to each other pursuant to the tax matters agreement, dated september 14, 2022.
credit facilities aig parent maintains a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility (the facility) with aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide aig parent with unsecured revolving loans and/or standby letters of credit of up to $4.5 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings. the facility is scheduled to expire in november 2026.
our ability to utilize the facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the facility. these include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the facility would restrict our access to the facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
as of december 31, 2023, a total of $4.5 billion remained available under the facility.
corebridge maintains a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility (the corebridge facility) with aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide corebridge with unsecured revolving loans and/or standby letters of credit of up to $2.5 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings and with no recourse to aig parent. the corebridge facility is scheduled to expire in may 2027.
as of december 31, 2023, a total of $2.5 billion remained available under the corebridge facility.
corebridge also maintains the ddtl facility, which is scheduled to mature in february 2025. as of december 31, 2023, a total of $250 million of borrowings are outstanding under the ddtl facility, with no recourse to aig parent.

loss reserves loss reserves relate to our general insurance companies and represent estimates of future loss and loss adjustment expense payments based on historical loss development payment patterns. the amounts presented in the above table are undiscounted and therefore exceed the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including allowance for credit losses, as presented on the consolidated balance sheets. due to the significance of the assumptions used, the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments. we believe that our general insurance companies maintain adequate financial resources to meet the actual required payments under these obligations.
for additional information on loss reserves, see critical accounting estimates - loss reserves and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
insurance and investment contract liabilities insurance and investment contract liabilities, including gic liabilities, relate to our life and retirement companies. these liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments. these liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. for these policies and contracts (i) we are not currently making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event beyond our control.
we have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits. the amounts presented in the above table are undiscounted and therefore exceed the liabilities for future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts, and policyholder contract deposits included in the consolidated balance sheets. due to the significance of the assumptions used, the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments.

aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management enterprise risk management overview risk management is an integral part of our business strategy and a key element of our approach to corporate governance. we have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm-wide risk appetite. our board of directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. our enterprise risk management (erm) department oversees and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of aig's major risk positions. erm embeds risk management in our key day-to-day business processes. nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur. for further information regarding the risks associated with our business and operations, see part i, item 1a. risk factors.
aig employs a three lines of defense model. aig's business leaders assume full accountability for the risks and controls in their segments, and erm performs a review, challenge and oversight function. the third line consists of our internal audit group that provides independent assurance to aig's board of directors.
risk governance structure our risk governance structure is designed to foster the development and maintenance of a risk and control culture that encompasses all significant risk categories impacting our lines of business and functions. accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual business leaders, with the risk committees' oversight.
our board of directors oversees the management of risk through its risk committee and audit committee. our chief risk officer (cro), a member of the executive leadership team, reports to both the risk committee and our chairman and chief executive officer. the aig cro chairs the group risk committee (grc), the senior management group responsible for assessing all significant risks on a global basis. the grc is supported by management committees including the business unit risk committees and legal entity risk committees.
risk appetite, limits, identification and measurement risk appetite framework approved by our board of directors, aig's risk appetite framework integrates stakeholder interests, strategic business goals and available financial resources. we balance these by seeking to take measured risks that are expected to generate repeatable, sustainable earnings and create long-term value for our shareholders. our risk tolerances take into consideration regulatory requirements, rating agency expectations, and business needs.
risk limits a key component of our risk appetite framework is the establishment and maintenance of tolerances and limits on material risks to meet aig's objectives. to support the monitoring and management of material risks, erm employs a three-tiered hierarchy consisting of board-level risk tolerances, aig management level limits, and business unit and legal entity level limits. board-level risk tolerances define the minimum level of consolidated capital and liquidity we should maintain, which are approved by the board of directors and monitored by the risk committee. aig management level limits are risk type specific limits at the aig consolidated level, which are approved by the aig cro with consultation from the grc. business unit and legal entity level limits address key risks identified for the business units and legal entities.
risk identification and measurement we conduct risk identification through multiple processes at the business unit and corporate level focused on capturing our material risks. a key initiative is our integrated bottom-up risk identification and assessment process which is conducted down to the product-line level. in addition, we perform an annual top-down risk assessment to identify top risks and assign owners to ensure these risks are appropriately addressed and managed. these processes are used as critical input to enhance and develop our analytics for measuring and assessing risks across the organization.
the internal capital framework quantifies our aggregate economic risk at a given confidence interval, after considering diversification benefits between risk factors and business lines. the stress testing framework assesses our aggregate exposure to our most significant financial and insurance risks. we use this information to support the assessment of resources needed at the aig parent level to support our subsidiaries and capital resources required to maintain consolidated company target capitalization levels.

direct and indirect credit exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, securities purchased under agreements to resell and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance and retrocessional insurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees, letters of credit, and certain general insurance businesses. our credit risk framework incorporates risk identification and measurement, risk limits, risk delegations to authorized credit professionals throughout the company, and credit reserving. credit reserving includes but is not limited to the development of a proper framework, policies and procedures for establishing accurate identification of (i) reserves for credit losses and (ii) other than temporary impairments for securities portfolios.
we monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. to minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts.
for additional information on our credit concentrations and credit exposures, see investments - credit ratings - available-for-sale investments.
derivative transactions we utilize derivatives principally to enable us to hedge exposure associated with changes in levels of interest rates, currencies, credit, commodities, equity prices and other risks. credit risk associated with derivative counterparties exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to us. all derivative transactions must be transacted within counterparty limits that have been approved by erm. we evaluate counterparty credit quality via an internal analysis that is consistent with the aig credit policy and, where necessary, we require credit enhancements for certain transactions and enter into offsetting and netting arrangements.
for additional information related to derivative transactions, see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
market risk management market risk is defined as the risk of adverse impact due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers: equity and commodity prices, residential and commercial real estate values, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange, inflation, and their respective levels of volatility. we are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and the liability sides of our balance sheet through on- and off-balance sheet exposures.
market risk is overseen at the corporate level within erm through the cro. market risk is managed by our finance, treasury and investment management corporate functions, collectively, and in partnership with erm. the scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is monitored through multiple lenses that include economic, gaap and statutory reporting frameworks at various levels of business consolidation, in a manner consistent with our risk appetite statement. this process aims to establish a comprehensive coverage of potential implications from adverse market risk developments. we use a number of approaches to measure market risk exposure including sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis and stress testing.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management market risk sensitivities the following table provides estimates of sensitivity to changes in yield curves, equity prices and foreign exchange (fx) rates on our financial instruments and excludes approximately $171.4 billion and $165.4 billion of insurance liabilities as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively. aig believes that the interest rate sensitivities of these insurance and other liabilities serve as an offset to the net interest rate risk of the financial assets presented in the table below. in addition, the table excludes $26.2 billion of interest rate sensitive assets and $2.1 billion of equity and alternative investments supporting the fortitude re funds withheld arrangements as the contractual returns related to the assets are transferred to fortitude re, as well as $29.5 billion of related funds withheld payables.

(d)the balance sheet exposures for equity contracts and variable annuity and other embedded derivatives are also reflected under "interest rate sensitive liabilities" above, and are not additive.
(e)the majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag. foreign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our aggregated non-u.s. dollar assets less our aggregated non-u.s. dollar liabilities on a gaap basis, with certain adjustments.
interest rate sensitivity is defined as the change in value with respect to a 100 basis point parallel shift up in the interest rate environment, calculated as: scenario value minus base value, where base value is the value under the yield curves as of the period end and scenario value is the value reflecting a 100 basis point parallel increase in all yield curves.
we evaluate our interest rate risk without considering effects of correlation of changes in levels of interest rate with other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the values of our financial assets and liabilities.
we evaluate our equity price risk without considering effects of correlation of changes in equity prices with other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the values of our financial assets and liabilities, as the stress scenario does not reflect the impact of basis risk which we use in the development of our hedging strategy.
for additional information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits, see - risk appetite, limits, identification and measurement - risk limits.
liquidity risk management liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations as they come due.
aig and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity both during the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash will be available to meet the obligations as they come due.
aig parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are designed to allow us to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario. we maintain liquidity limits and minimum coverage ratios designed to ensure that funding needs are met under stress conditions. liquidity risk drivers include market/monetization risk, cash flow mismatch risk, event funding risk, and financing risk.
liquidity risk is monitored through comprehensive cash flow projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows. we use several approaches to measure liquidity risk exposure including minimum liquidity limits, coverage ratios, coverage flow forecasts and stress testing.
operational risk management operational risk is defined as the risk of loss, or other adverse consequences, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events. operational risk includes legal, regulatory, technology, compliance, third-party and business continuity risks, but excludes business and strategy risks.
operational risk is inherent in each of our business units and functions and can have many impacts, including but not limited to, unexpected economic losses or gains, reputational harm due to negative publicity, regulatory action from supervisory agencies and operational and business disruptions, and/or damage to customer relationships.
the operational risk management (orm) function within erm oversees adherence to the operational risk policy and risk and control framework.
orm, working together with other control and assurance functions and first line risk control owners through the risk and control framework, provides an independent view of operational risks for each of the business areas.
cybersecurity risk aig, like other global companies, continues to witness the increased sophistication and activities of unauthorized parties attempting cyber and other computer-related penetrations such as "denial of service" attacks, phishing, untargeted but sophisticated and automated attacks, and other disruptive software in an effort to compromise systems, networks and obtain sensitive information.
erm works closely with and supports the risk management practices of information technology, the information security office and the business units and functions that form the lines of defense against the cybersecurity risks that we face.
for additional information regarding the privacy data protection and cybersecurity regulations to which we are subject, see part i, item 1. business - regulation - privacy, data protection, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence requirements. for additional discussion of cybersecurity risks, see part i, item 1a. risk factors - business and operations. for additional information regarding our cybersecurity risk management as well as strategy and governance, please see part 1, item 1c. cybersecurity.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management insurance risks insurance risk is defined as the risk of actual claims experience and/or policyholder behavior being materially different than initially expected at the inception of an insurance contract. uncertainties related to insurance risk can lead to deviations in magnitude and/or timing of prospective cash flows associated with our liabilities compared to what we expected.
we manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. a primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. to achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.
we operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. we manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of processes and procedures, including but not limited to, pricing and risk selection models, pricing approval processes, pre-launch approval of product design, development, and distribution, underwriting approval processes and authorities, modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels, model risk management framework and validation processes, risk transfer tools, review and challenge of reserves, actuarial profitability and reserve reviews, management of the relationship between assets and liabilities, and experience monitoring and assumption updates.
we closely manage insurance risk by monitoring and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each underwritten line of business, concentrations in industries, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums we charge for taking on the risk. we analyze concentrations of risks using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.
risk measurement, monitoring and limits we use several approaches to measure our insurance risk exposure including sensitivity and scenario analyses, stochastic methods, and experience studies. additionally, there are risk-specific assessment tools, both internal and third-party, in place to better manage the variety of insurance risks to which we are exposed.
for additional information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits, see - risk appetite, limits, identification and measurement - risk limits.
general insurance companies' key risks we manage our risks through risk review and selection processes, exposure limitations, exclusions, deductibles, self-insured retentions, coverage limits, attachment points, and reinsurance. this management is supported by sound underwriting practices, pricing procedures and the use of actuarial analysis to help determine overall adequacy of provisions for insurance.
for general insurance companies, risks primarily include loss reserves, underwriting, catastrophe exposure, single risk loss exposure, and reinsurance. the potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the general insurance companies, which we manage through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. for further information, see critical accounting estimates - loss reserves.
the potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the general insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. we develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit.
our business is exposed to loss events, such as fires or explosions, that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. the net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the chief underwriting officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance.
since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the recoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated, which is monitored through our credit risk management framework.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management natural catastrophe risk we manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate probable maximum loss (pml) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, modifying our gross underwriting standards, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.
we use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures with adjustments applied to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.
we recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. with multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policies to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning and will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change. in addition, we provide insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change.
the table below details our modeled estimates of pml, net of reinsurance, on an annual aggregate basis. the 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 pmls are the annual aggregate probable maximum losses with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively. estimates as of december 31, 2023 reflect our in-force portfolio for exposures as of october 1, 2023, and all inuring reinsurance covers as of december 31, 2023, except for the catastrophe reinsurance programs, which are as of january 1, 2024 and reflected as of such date.
at december 31, 2023                               net of                 net of reinsurance,after tax(f)                    percent of total                    percent of total reinsurance                                                                shareholders' equity                shareholders' equity excluding aoci
(f)taxed at the statutory tax rate of 21 percent for both the u.s. and japanese modeled losses. the majority of japan exposures are ceded to our u.s. pool.
aig, along with other property casualty insurance and reinsurance companies, uses industry-recognized catastrophe models and applies proprietary modeling processes and assumptions to arrive at loss estimates. the use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses, and our modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies.
also, the modeled results are based on the assumption that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to us under the terms of the reinsurance arrangements. these estimates are inherently uncertain and may not accurately reflect our net exposure, inclusive of credit risk, to these events.
our 2024 property catastrophe reinsurance program is a worldwide program providing both aggregate and per occurrence protection, with differing per occurrence and aggregate retentions for north america, japan, and rest of world. in 2024, we purchased our north america property catastrophe reinsurance program with several coverage enhancements and unchanged attachment points of $500 million for the commercial portfolio and $300 million for lexington insurance company and programs business. for international, we reduced our japan attachment point to $150 million and rest of world remained unchanged at $125 million.
we have also purchased property per risk covers that provide protection against large losses globally, which include those emanating from non-critical catastrophe events (all events except for named windstorm and earthquake) globally as well as critical catastrophe events (named windstorm and earthquake) outside north america.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios. the occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
for additional information, see also part 1, item 1a. risk factors - reserves and exposures.
terrorism risk we actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the general insurance companies' exposures.
our largest terrorism concentrations are in new york city, and estimated losses are largely driven by the property and workers' compensation lines of business. our exposure to terrorism risk in the u.s. is mitigated by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act (tripra) in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. tripra covers certified terrorist attacks within the u.s. or u.s. missions and against certain u.s. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law.
we offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. international terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. we also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-u.s. jurisdictions.
life and retirement companies' key risks for life and retirement companies, risks include longevity risk, morbidity risk, mortality (including pandemic) risk, and policyholder behavior risk (including full and partial surrender lapses). the emergence of significant adverse experience compared to the experience we expected and priced for could require an adjustment to benefit reserves and/or dac, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations for a particular period.
we manage risk through product design, experience monitoring, pricing and underwriting discipline, risk limits and thresholds, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the alignment between risk and cash flow profiles of assets and liabilities, and hedging instruments.
for additional information on the impact of actual and expected experience on dac and benefit reserves, see critical accounting estimates - future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and critical accounting estimates - market risk benefits. for additional information on business risks, see part i, item 1a. risk factors - business and operations.
variable annuity, fixed index annuity and index universal life risk management and hedging programs our individual and group retirement businesses offer variable and fixed index annuity products with guaranteed living benefit (glb) riders that guarantee a certain level of lifetime benefits. under current gaap rules, variable and certain index annuity glbs are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in other realized gains (losses). glb features subject the life and retirement companies to market risk, including exposure to changes in levels of interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility.
risk mitigation features of our variable annuity product designs include glb rider fees indexed to a broad equity market volatility index, required minimum allocations to fixed accounts to reduce overall equity exposure, and for some of the variable annuity products, the utilization of volatility control funds.
we utilize asset liability management and hedging programs to manage economic exposure to market risks that are not fully mitigated through product designs. our hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target established via a stochastic projection for policyholder behavior in conjunction with market scenarios calibrated to observable equity and interest option prices, which represents our estimate of the underlying economic risks in the embedded derivatives.
in designing the hedging portfolio for our variable annuity hedging program, we make assumptions that are used in projections of future performance of the underlying mutual funds elected by the variable annuity policyholders. basis risk exists due to the variance between funds returns projected under these assumptions and actual fund returns, which may result in variances between changes in the value of the hedging portfolio and changes in the economic value of the hedge liability target. our hedging programs associated with index annuity and index universal life products are designed to manage market risk associated with the index crediting strategies offered on these product platforms.
to manage the capital market exposures embedded within the economic liability hedge targets, we identify and hedge market sensitivities to changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility and for variable annuities, credit spreads. each hedge program purchases derivative instruments or securities having sensitivities that offset corresponding sensitivities in the associated economic hedge targets, within internally defined threshold limits.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management our hedging programs utilize various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaptions. in addition, within the variable annuities hedging program, we purchase certain fixed income securities classified as available for sale.
the hedging programs are monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the economic liability hedge targets and the associated derivative portfolios stay within the threshold limits, pursuant to the approved hedging strategies. in addition, monthly stress tests are performed to determine the program's effectiveness relative to the applicable limits, under an array of combined severe market stresses in equity prices, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. finally, hedging strategies are reviewed regularly to gauge their effectiveness in managing our market exposures in the context of our overall risk appetite.
for information on the impact on our consolidated pre-tax income from the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives and the hedging portfolio, as well as additional discussion of differences between the economic hedge target and the valuation of the embedded derivatives, see insurance reserves - life and annuity future policy benefits, policyholder contract deposits and market risk benefits - variable annuity guaranteed benefits and hedging results.
reinsurance activities we purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations. reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. we may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis.
reinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss (life and non-life) exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. in addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.
reinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. however, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.
reinsurance recoverable aig's reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of paid losses recoverable, ceded loss reserves, ceded reserves for unearned premiums, and life and annuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves and policyholder contract deposits).
at december 31, 2023, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $67.5 billion. these assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $4.6 billion, ceded loss reserves of $30.4 billion including reserves for ibnr claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $4.3 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $28.2 billion. the methods used to estimate ibnr and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. these methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. any adjustments are reflected in income. we believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at december 31, 2023 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. actual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.
at december 31, 2023, we held $70.1 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers.
at december 31, 2023, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. reduced profitability associated with lower interest rates, market volatility and catastrophe losses (including covid-19), could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. the reinsurance credit department, in conjunction with the credit executives within erm, reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require aig's reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.

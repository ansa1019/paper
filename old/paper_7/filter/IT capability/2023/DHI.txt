item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to promote an understanding of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results. md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this form 10-k. this section discusses the results of operations for fiscal 2023 compared to 2022. for similar operating and financial data and discussion of our fiscal 2022 results compared to our fiscal 2021 results, refer to item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" under part ii of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2022, which was filed with the sec on november 18, 2022.
the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to any differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under the caption "forward-looking statements" and under item 1a, "risk factors."
consolidated net cash provided by operating activities was $4.3 billion in fiscal 2023 and $561.8 million in fiscal 2022, and cash provided by our homebuilding operations was $3.1 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2022. in fiscal 2023, our return on equity (roe) was 22.7% compared to 34.5% in fiscal 2022, and our homebuilding return on inventory (roi) was 29.7% compared to 42.8%. roe is calculated as net income attributable to d.r. horton for the year divided by average stockholders' equity, where average stockholders' equity is the sum of ending stockholders' equity balances of the trailing five quarters divided by five. homebuilding roi is calculated as homebuilding pre-tax income for the year divided by average inventory, where average inventory is the sum of ending homebuilding inventory balances for the trailing five quarters divided by five.
demand for new homes remained solid during fiscal 2023 as our net sales orders increased 3% compared to fiscal 2022. although inflationary pressures and mortgage interest rates remain elevated, demand improved beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 due to typical seasonal factors, coupled with our use of incentives and pricing adjustments to adapt to market conditions. the disruptions in the supply chain for certain building materials and tightness in the labor market we experienced during the past two years have largely subsided, and our construction cycle times are improving. our homebuilding operating margins are lower than last year due to pricing adjustments, incentives and cost inflation, but margins improved in the second half of the year as home prices and incentives stabilized and some reductions in construction costs were realized. although higher interest rates and economic uncertainty may persist for some time, the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points remains limited, and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable. we believe we are well-positioned to meet changing market conditions with our affordable product offerings and lot supply and will manage our home pricing, sales incentives and number of homes in inventory based on the level of homebuyer demand.
within our homebuilding land and lot portfolio, our lots controlled through purchase contracts represent 75% of the lots owned and controlled at september 30, 2023 compared to 77% at september 30, 2022. we remain focused on our relationships with forestar and other land developers across the country and expect to continue to control a substantial majority of our lot pipeline through purchase contracts.
we believe our strong balance sheet and liquidity position provide us with the flexibility to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. we plan to continue to generate strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and manage our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments in each of our communities based on local housing market conditions.
strategy our operating strategy focuses on consistently enhancing long-term value to our shareholders by leveraging our financial and competitive position to maximize the returns on our inventory investments and generate strong profitability and cash flows, while managing risk and maintaining financial flexibility to navigate changing economic conditions. our strategy includes the following initiatives:
•maintaining a significant cash balance and strong overall liquidity position while controlling our level of debt.
•offering new home communities that appeal to a broad range of entry-level, move-up, active adult and luxury homebuyers based on consumer demand in each market.
•modifying product offerings, sales pace, home prices and incentives as necessary in each of our markets to meet consumer demand and maintain affordability.
•delivering high quality homes and a positive experience to our customers both during and after the sale.
•controlling a significant portion of our land and finished lot position through purchase contracts with forestar and other land developers.
•improving the efficiency of our land development, construction, sales and other key operational activities.
•ensuring that our financial services business provides high quality mortgage and title services to homebuyers efficiently and effectively.
•investing in the construction and leasing of single-family and multi-family rental properties to meet rental demand in high growth suburban markets and selling these properties profitably.
•opportunistically evaluating potential acquisitions to enhance our operating platform.
we believe our operating strategy, which has produced positive results in recent years, will allow us to successfully operate through changing economic conditions and maintain our strong financial performance and competitive position. however, we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful, and we may need to adjust parts of our strategy to meet future market conditions.
•multi-family rental units closed totaled 2,112 compared to 775.
•forestar's owned and controlled lots totaled 79,200 compared to 90,100. of these lots, 31,400 were under contract to sell to or subject to a right of first offer with d.r. horton compared to 36,700.
•forestar's debt to total capital was 33.7% compared to 37.1%, and forestar's net debt to total capital was 5.5% compared to 26.9%.
•stockholders' equity was $22.7 billion compared to $19.4 billion.
•debt to total capital was 18.3% compared to 23.8%, and net debt to total capital was 5.1% compared to 15.4%.
results of operations - homebuilding our operating segments are our 81 homebuilding divisions, our rental operations, our majority-owned forestar residential lot development operations, our financial services operations and our other business activities. the homebuilding operating segments are aggregated into six reporting segments. these reporting segments, which we also refer to as reporting regions, have homebuilding operations located in the following states:
(1)net sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers (gross sales orders), net of cancelled sales orders.
in late fiscal 2022, we began to see a moderation in housing demand that persisted into early fiscal 2023 as mortgage interest rates increased substantially and inflationary pressures remained elevated. despite the continuation of those conditions, demand improved beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 due to typical seasonal factors, coupled with an increased use of incentives and pricing adjustments to adapt to changing market conditions. although higher interest rates and economic uncertainty may persist for some time, the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points remains limited, and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable. we believe we are well-positioned to meet changing market conditions with our affordable product offerings and lot supply.
gross profit - home sales                                        23.5     %                          28.7     %
gross profit - land/lot sales and other                          47.4     %                          36.3     %
gross profit - total homebuilding                                23.4     %                          28.5     %
home sales gross profit gross profit from home sales decreased to $7.4 billion in 2023 from $9.1 billion in 2022 and decreased 520 basis points to 23.5% as a percentage of home sales revenues. the percentage decrease resulted from a decrease of 530 basis points due to the average cost of our homes closed increasing while the average selling price of those homes decreased, partially offset by 10 basis points due to a reduction in warranty and construction defect costs.
we remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the returns on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. to adjust to changing market conditions and higher mortgage interest rates during fiscal 2023, we increased our use of incentives and reduced home prices and sizes of our home offerings where necessary to provide better affordability to homebuyers. based on current market conditions, we expect to continue offering a higher level of incentives in fiscal 2024.
land/lot sales and other revenues land/lot sales and other revenues from our homebuilding operations were $102.2 million and $61.4 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. we continually evaluate our land and lot supply, and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets. we generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them. however, some of the land that we purchase includes commercially zoned parcels that we may sell to commercial developers. we may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our supply or for other strategic reasons. as of september 30, 2023, our homebuilding operations had $8.7 million of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months.
inventory and land option charges at the end of each quarter, we review the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment and perform detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary. as a result of this review, there were $2.0 million of impairments recorded in our homebuilding segment during the three months ended september 30, 2023. during fiscal 2023, impairment charges related to our homebuilding segment totaled $7.7 million. there were no impairment charges recorded in our homebuilding segment in fiscal 2022.
as we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows, we may modify our pricing and incentives, construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities and land held for development, which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for potential impairment. if the housing market or economic conditions are adversely affected for a prolonged period, we may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment. these evaluations could result in impairment charges, which could be significant.
during fiscal 2023 and 2022, earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs related to our homebuilding segment's land purchase contracts that we have terminated or expect to terminate were $53.0 million and $57.2 million, respectively.
selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expense sg&a expense from homebuilding activities increased 2% to $2.24 billion in fiscal 2023 from $2.19 billion in fiscal 2022. sg&a expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues was 7.1% and 6.8% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.
interest incurred we capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction (active inventory). capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer. interest incurred by our homebuilding operations decreased 38% to $68.8 million in fiscal 2023 from $110.7 million in fiscal 2022, primarily due to a 25% decrease in our average homebuilding debt. interest charged to cost of sales was 0.4% and 0.5% of homebuilding cost of sales (excluding inventory and land option charges) in those years.
other income other income, net of other expenses, included in our homebuilding operations increased to $78.8 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $16.4 million in fiscal 2022, primarily due to an increase in interest income. other income also consists of various other types of ancillary income, gains, expenses and losses not directly associated with sales of homes, land and lots. the activities that result in this ancillary income are not significant, either individually or in the aggregate.
business acquisitions in december 2022, we acquired the homebuilding operations of riggins custom homes in northwest arkansas for approximately $107 million in cash. the assets acquired included approximately 170 homes in inventory, 3,000 lots and a sales order backlog of 100 homes.
in june 2023, we acquired the homebuilding operations of truland homes for approximately $110 million in cash. truland homes operates in baldwin county, alabama and northwest florida. the assets acquired included approximately 155 homes in inventory, 620 lots and a sales order backlog of 55 homes. we also acquired control of approximately 660 additional lots through land purchase contracts.
(1)expenses maintained at the corporate level consist primarily of interest and property taxes, which are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales or expensed directly, and the expenses related to operating our corporate office. the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes is allocated to each segment based on the segment's cost of sales, while expenses associated with the corporate office are allocated to each segment based on the segment's inventory balances.
northwest region - homebuilding revenues decreased 3% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, due to decreases in the average selling price of homes closed in most of our markets, partially offset by an increase in homes closed in our salt lake city and seattle markets. the region generated pre-tax income of $391.1 million in 2023 compared to $560.8 million in 2022. gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenue (home sales gross profit percentage) decreased by 600 basis points in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the average cost of homes closed increasing while the average selling price of those homes decreased. as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, sg&a expenses increased by 30 basis points in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to an increase in sg&a expenses.
southwest region - homebuilding revenues decreased 12% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to decreases in the number of homes closed in most markets and a decrease in the average selling price. the region generated pre-tax income of $489.3 million in 2023 compared to $968.3 million in 2022. home sales gross profit percentage decreased by 820 basis points in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the average cost of homes closed increasing while the average selling price of those homes decreased. as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, sg&a expenses increased by 50 basis points in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the decrease in homebuilding revenues.
south central region - homebuilding revenues decreased 7% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to decreases in the number of homes closed in our dallas and houston markets. the region generated pre-tax income of $1.4 billion in 2023 compared to $1.9 billion in 2022. home sales gross profit percentage decreased by 490 basis points in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the average cost of homes closed increasing while the average selling price of those homes decreased. as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, sg&a expenses increased by 40 basis points in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the decrease in homebuilding revenues.
southeast region - homebuilding revenues increased 10% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to increases in the number of homes closed in our jacksonville, orlando and tampa markets. the region generated pre-tax income of $1.7 billion in 2023 compared to $1.9 billion in 2022. home sales gross profit percentage decreased by 520 basis points in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the average cost of homes closed increasing by more than the average selling price of those homes. as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, sg&a expenses decreased by 40 basis points in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the increase in homebuilding revenues.
east region - homebuilding revenues were essentially flat in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. the region generated pre-tax income of $935.7 million in 2023 compared to $1.1 billion in 2022. home sales gross profit percentage decreased by 350 basis points in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the average cost of homes closed increasing while the average selling price of those homes decreased. as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, sg&a expenses increased by 30 basis points in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to an increase in sg&a expenses.
north region - homebuilding revenues increased 7% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, due to increases in the number of homes closed in most of our markets. the region generated pre-tax income of $350.8 million in 2023 compared to $456.3 million in 2022. home sales gross profit percentage decreased by 470 basis points in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the average cost of homes closed increasing while the average selling price of those homes decreased. as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, sg&a expenses increased by 40 basis points in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to an increase in sg&a expenses.
homebuilding inventories, land and lot position and homes in inventory we routinely enter into contracts to purchase land or developed residential lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with planned development or anticipated new home demand. at the time of purchase, the undeveloped land is generally vested with the rights to begin development or construction work, and we plan and coordinate the development of our land into residential lots for use in our homebuilding business. we manage our inventory of owned land and lots and homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets, including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold, completed homes in inventory.
(1)corporate and unallocated inventory consists primarily of capitalized interest and property taxes.
our land and lot position and homes in inventory at september 30, 2023 and 2022 are summarized as follows:
(2)the total remaining purchase price of lots controlled through land and lot purchase contracts at september 30, 2023 and 2022 was $21.1 billion and $19.7 billion, respectively, secured by earnest money deposits of $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. the total remaining purchase price of lots controlled through land and lot purchase contracts at september 30, 2023 and 2022 included $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, related to lot purchase contracts with forestar, secured by $139.1 million and $131.7 million, respectively, of earnest money.
results of operations - rental our rental segment consists of single-family and multi-family rental operations. the single-family rental operations primarily construct and lease single-family homes within a community and then market each community for a bulk sale of rental homes. the multi-family rental operations develop, construct, lease and sell residential rental properties, with a primary focus on constructing garden style apartment communities in high growth suburban markets. single-family and multi-family rental property sales are recognized as revenues, and rental income is recognized as other income. the following tables provide further information regarding our rental operations as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023 and 2022.
rental homes/units closed year ended september 30,
multi-family rental units               2,112

results of operations - forestar at september 30, 2023, we owned 63% of the outstanding shares of forestar. forestar is a publicly traded residential lot development company with operations in 54 markets across 22 states as of september 30, 2023. (see note b to the accompanying financial statements for additional forestar segment information.)
forestar's revenues are primarily derived from sales of single-family residential lots to local, regional and national homebuilders and land bankers for homebuilders. the following tables provide further information regarding forestar's revenues and lot position as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023 and 2022.
owned lots subject to right of first offer with d.r. horton                                                                             17,000                            18,900

results of operations - financial services the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations, comprising dhi mortgage and our subsidiary title companies, for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2023 and 2022.
title policy premiums                                                                185.2                       177.6                         4    %
mortgage loan activity dhi mortgage's primary focus is to originate loans for our homebuilding operations and those loan originations account for the majority of its total loan volume. in fiscal 2023, while the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations increased only slightly, the percentage of the loans originated by dhi mortgage related to those homes closed was 76%, up from 69% in fiscal 2022. this increase reflects dhi mortgage's ongoing efforts to align their business with our homebuilding operations by offering competitive products and pricing.
the number of loans sold increased 9% in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year. virtually all of the mortgage loans held for sale on september 30, 2023 were eligible for sale to fannie mae, freddie mac or ginnie mae. during fiscal 2023, approximately 64% of our mortgage loans were sold directly to fannie mae, freddie mac or into securities backed by ginnie mae, and 34% were sold to one other major financial entity. changes in market conditions could result in a greater concentration of our mortgage sales in future periods to fewer financial entities and directly to fannie mae, freddie mac or ginnie mae, and we may need to make other adjustments to our mortgage operations.
financial services revenues and expenses total loan origination volume increased 8% during fiscal 2023, while revenues from our mortgage operations decreased slightly to $616.3 million from $617.4 million in fiscal 2022, primarily due to competitive pricing pressure in the secondary market. revenues from our title operations increased 4% to $185.2 million in fiscal 2023 from $177.6 million in fiscal 2022.
results of operations - other businesses in addition to our homebuilding, rental, forestar and financial services operations, we engage in other business activities through our subsidiaries. we conduct insurance-related operations, own water rights and other water-related assets and own non-residential real estate including ranch land and improvements. the pre-tax income of all of our subsidiaries engaged in other business activities was $32.4 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $58.1 million in fiscal 2022.
income taxes our income tax expense was $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, and our effective tax rate was 24.1% and 22.7% in those years. the effective tax rates for both years include an expense for state income taxes and tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and federal energy efficient homes tax credits.
our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, were $202.0 million at september 30, 2023 compared to $159.0 million at september 30, 2022. we have a valuation allowance of $14.8 million and $17.9 million at september 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to deferred tax assets for state net operating loss (nol), state capital loss and tax credit carryforwards that are expected to expire before being realized. we will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining state nol and tax credit carryforwards. any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods will impact our effective tax rate.
capital resources and liquidity we have historically funded our operations with cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities. our current levels of cash, borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to changes in economic and market conditions.
we have continued to increase our investments in our homebuilding and rental inventories to expand our operations. we are also returning capital to our shareholders through dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. we are maintaining significant homebuilding cash balances and liquidity to support the increased scale and level of activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing conditions and opportunities.
at september 30, 2023, we had outstanding notes payable with varying maturities totaling an aggregate principal amount of $5.1 billion, of which $1.9 billion is payable within 12 months and includes $1.7 billion outstanding under our mortgage repurchase facilities. future interest payments associated with the notes total $396.1 million, of which $224.4 million is payable within 12 months.
at september 30, 2023, our ratio of debt to total capital (notes payable divided by stockholders' equity plus notes payable) was 18.3% compared to 23.8% at september 30, 2022. our net debt to total capital (notes payable net of cash divided by stockholders' equity plus notes payable net of cash) was 5.1% at september 30, 2023 compared to 15.4% at september 30, 2022. over the long term, we intend to maintain our ratio of debt to total capital below 25%, and we expect it to remain below 20% in fiscal 2024.
at september 30, 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit of $254.3 million and surety bonds of $3.2 billion, issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts. we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. when we complete our performance obligations, the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter, leaving us with no continuing obligations. we have no material third-party guarantees.
we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business, repay debt obligations, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock and maintain sufficient cash and liquidity levels to support our other operational needs, and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital. d.r. horton has an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in july 2021, registering debt and equity securities that may be issued from time to time in amounts to be determined. forestar also has an effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec in october 2021, registering $750 million of equity securities, of which $300 million was reserved for sales under its at-the-market equity offering (atm) program that became effective in november 2021. at september 30, 2023, $748.2 million remained available for issuance under forestar's shelf registration statement, of which $298.2 million was reserved for sales under its atm program. as market conditions permit, we may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity. we believe that our existing cash resources, revolving credit facilities, mortgage repurchase facilities and ability to access the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our near-term working capital needs and debt obligations for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter.
capital resources - homebuilding cash and cash equivalents - at september 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents of our homebuilding segment totaled $2.9 billion.
bank credit facility - we have a $2.19 billion senior unsecured homebuilding revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $3.0 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. the facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to 100% of the total revolving credit commitments. letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the available borrowing capacity. the maturity date of the facility is october 28, 2027. at september 30, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding and $226.6 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity of $1.96 billion.
our homebuilding revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations and activities, including requiring the maintenance of a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction if our leverage ratio exceeds a certain level. these covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. a failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. the credit agreement governing the facility imposes restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. at september 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of our homebuilding revolving credit facility.
public unsecured debt - in february 2023, we repaid $300 million principal amount of our 4.75% senior notes at maturity, and in july 2023, we redeemed $400 million principal amount of our 5.75% senior notes due august 2023. the senior notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest. at september 30, 2023, we had $2.1 billion principal amount of homebuilding senior notes outstanding that mature from october 2024 through october 2027.
the indentures governing our senior notes impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. at september 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all of the limitations and restrictions associated with our public debt obligations.
our homebuilding revolving credit facility and senior notes are guaranteed by d.r. horton, inc.'s significant wholly-owned homebuilding subsidiaries.
debt and stock repurchase authorizations - in july 2019, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of debt securities. in april 2023, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock, replacing the prior stock repurchase authorization. during fiscal 2023, we repurchased 11.1 million shares at a total cost, including commissions and excise taxes, of $1.2 billion. at september 30, 2023, the full amount of the debt repurchase authorization was remaining, and $234.0 million of the stock repurchase authorization was remaining. in october 2023, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our common stock, replacing the previous authorization, which at that time had only $32.8 million remaining due to repurchases made subsequent to year end. the debt and stock repurchase authorizations have no expiration date.
capital resources - rental during the past two years, we have made significant investments in our rental operations. the inventory in our rental segment totaled $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion at september 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
bank credit facility - our rental subsidiary, drh rental, has a $1.025 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $1.25 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. availability under the rental revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation based on the book value of drh rental's real estate assets and unrestricted cash. the facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to the greater of $100 million and 50% of the total revolving credit commitments. the maturity date of the facility is march 4, 2026. borrowings and repayments under the facility totaled $700 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, during fiscal 2023. at september 30, 2023, there were $400 million of borrowings outstanding at a 7.7% annual interest rate, and no letters of credit issued under the facility, resulting in available capacity of $625 million.
in october 2023, drh rental's credit facility was amended to extend its maturity date to october 10, 2027 and to increase its accordion feature to allow for an increase in the size of the facility up to $2.0 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments.
the rental revolving credit facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and financial covenants. the financial covenants require drh rental to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth, a minimum level of liquidity and a maximum allowable leverage ratio. these covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. a failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. at september 30, 2023, drh rental was in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of its revolving credit facility.
the rental revolving credit facility is guaranteed by drh rental's wholly-owned subsidiaries that are not immaterial subsidiaries or have not been designated as unrestricted subsidiaries. the rental revolving credit facility is not guaranteed by d.r. horton, inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee the debt of our homebuilding, forestar or financial services operations.
capital resources - forestar the achievement of forestar's long-term growth objectives will depend on its ability to obtain financing and generate sufficient cash flows from operations. as market conditions permit, forestar may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to provide capital for future growth and additional liquidity. at september 30, 2023, forestar's ratio of debt to total capital (notes payable divided by stockholders' equity plus notes payable) was 33.7% compared to 37.1% at september 30, 2022. forestar's ratio of net debt to total capital (notes payable net of cash divided by stockholders' equity plus notes payable net of cash) was 5.5% compared to 26.9% at september 30, 2022.
bank credit facility - forestar has a $410 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $600 million, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. the facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to the greater of $100 million and 50% of the total revolving credit commitments. borrowings under the revolving credit facility are subject to a borrowing base calculation based on the book value of forestar's real estate assets and unrestricted cash. letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the available borrowing capacity. the maturity date of the facility is october 28, 2026. at september 30, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding and $27.7 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity of $382.3 million.
the forestar revolving credit facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and financial covenants. the financial covenants require forestar to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth, a minimum level of liquidity and a maximum allowable leverage ratio. these covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. a failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity.
unsecured debt - as of september 30, 2023, forestar had $700 million principal amount of senior notes issued pursuant to rule 144a and regulation s under the securities act of 1933, as amended, which represent unsecured obligations of forestar. these notes include $400 million principal amount of 3.85% senior notes that mature in may 2026 and $300 million principal amount of 5.0% senior notes that mature in march 2028.
at september 30, 2023, forestar was in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of its revolving credit facility and senior note obligations.
forestar's revolving credit facility and its senior notes are guaranteed by forestar's wholly-owned subsidiaries that are not immaterial subsidiaries or have not been designated as unrestricted subsidiaries. they are not guaranteed by d.r. horton, inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee the debt of our homebuilding, rental or financial services operations.
debt repurchase authorization - in april 2020, forestar's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $30 million of forestar's debt securities. all of the $30 million authorization was remaining at september 30, 2023, and the authorization has no expiration date.
issuance of common stock - during fiscal 2023, there were no shares of common stock issued under forestar's atm program. at september 30, 2023, $748.2 million remained available for issuance under forestar's shelf registration statement, of which $298.2 million was reserved for sales under its atm program.
capital resources - financial services cash and cash equivalents - at september 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents of our financial services segment totaled $189.1 million.
mortgage repurchase facilities - our mortgage subsidiary, dhi mortgage, has two mortgage repurchase facilities, one of which is committed and the other of which is uncommitted, that provide financing and liquidity to dhi mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which dhi mortgage transfers eligible loans to counterparties upon receipt of funds from the counterparties. dhi mortgage then has the right and obligation to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to third-party purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time frames in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facilities.
the committed mortgage repurchase facility has a total capacity of $2.0 billion and a maturity date of february 16, 2024. the capacity of the committed mortgage repurchase facility can be increased to $2.3 billion subject to the availability of additional commitments. at september 30, 2023, dhi mortgage had an obligation of $1.4 billion under the committed mortgage repurchase facility at a 6.9% annual interest rate.
in april 2023, dhi mortgage entered into a master repurchase agreement providing for an uncommitted mortgage repurchase facility. at september 30, 2023, dhi mortgage could borrow up to $300 million under the uncommitted mortgage repurchase facility and had an obligation of $296.3 million at a 6.6% annual interest rate.
as of september 30, 2023, $2.22 billion of mortgage loans held for sale with a collateral value of $2.18 billion were pledged under the committed mortgage repurchase facility, and $323.0 million of mortgage loans held for sale with a collateral value of $300.9 million were pledged under the uncommitted mortgage repurchase facility.
the facilities contain financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary's minimum required tangible net worth, its maximum allowable indebtedness to tangible net worth ratio and its minimum required liquidity. at september 30, 2023, dhi mortgage was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facilities.
these mortgage repurchase facilities are not guaranteed by d.r. horton, inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee the debt of our homebuilding, rental or forestar operations.
in the past, dhi mortgage has been able to renew or extend its committed mortgage repurchase facility at a sufficient capacity and on satisfactory terms prior to its maturity and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments to the facility during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale. the liquidity of our financial services business depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the committed mortgage repurchase facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities.
operating cash flow activities in fiscal 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $4.3 billion compared to $561.8 million in fiscal 2022. cash provided by operating activities in the current year primarily consisted of $3.1 billion, $739.2 million, $364.1 million and $13.2 million of cash provided by our homebuilding, rental, forestar and financial services segments, respectively. the most significant source of cash provided by operating activities in both years was net income.
investing cash flow activities in fiscal 2023, net cash used in investing activities was $310.2 million compared to $414.9 million in fiscal 2022. in fiscal 2023, uses of cash included the acquisitions of the homebuilding operations of riggins custom homes for $107 million and truland homes for approximately $110 million and purchases of property and equipment totaling $148.6 million. in fiscal 2022, uses of cash included the acquisition of vidler water resources, inc. for $271.5 million and purchases of property and equipment totaling $148.2 million.
financing cash flow activities we expect the short-term financing needs of our operations will be funded with existing cash, cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. long-term financing needs for our operations may be funded with the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities or equity securities through the capital markets.
in fiscal 2023, net cash used in financing activities was $2.7 billion, consisting primarily of repurchases of common stock of $1.2 billion, repayment of $300 million principal amount of our 4.75% homebuilding senior notes and $400 million principal amount of our 5.75% homebuilding senior notes, net payments on our rental revolving credit facility of $400 million and payment of cash dividends totaling $341.2 million. these uses of cash were partially offset by net advances on our mortgage repurchase facility of $51.3 million.
in fiscal 2022, net cash used in financing activities was $811.2 million, consisting primarily of repurchases of common stock of $1.1 billion, repayment of $350 million principal amount of our 4.375% homebuilding senior notes and payment of cash dividends totaling $316.5 million. these uses of cash were partially offset by net borrowings on our rental revolving credit facility of $800 million and net advances on our mortgage repurchase facility of $123.7 million. sources and uses of cash also included borrowings and repayments under our homebuilding revolving credit facility totaling $3.5 billion each.
our board of directors approved and paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.25 per common share in fiscal 2023 and $0.225 per common share in fiscal 2022. in october 2023, our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per common share, payable on november 28, 2023, to stockholders of record on november 21, 2023. the declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, financial condition and general business conditions.
supplemental guarantor financial information as of september 30, 2023, d.r. horton, inc. had $2.1 billion principal amount of homebuilding senior notes outstanding due through october 2027 and no amounts outstanding on its homebuilding revolving credit facility.
all of the homebuilding senior notes and the homebuilding revolving credit facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by certain subsidiaries of d.r. horton, inc. (guarantors or guarantor subsidiaries). each of the guarantor subsidiaries is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by d.r. horton, inc. our subsidiaries associated with the single-family and multi-family rental operations, forestar lot development operations, financial services operations and certain other subsidiaries do not guarantee the homebuilding senior notes or the homebuilding revolving credit facility (collectively, non-guarantor subsidiaries). the guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor and rank equal with all existing and future senior debt of such guarantor and senior to all subordinated debt of such guarantor. the guarantees are effectively subordinated to any secured debt of such guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries of the guarantors.
the guarantees by a guarantor subsidiary will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) the sale or other disposition of its common stock whereby it is no longer a subsidiary of ours; (2) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets (other than to us or another guarantor); (3) its merger or consolidation with an entity other than us or another guarantor; or (4) its ceasing to guarantee any of our publicly traded debt securities and ceasing to guarantee any of our obligations under our homebuilding revolving credit facility.
the enforceability of the obligations of the guarantor subsidiaries under their guarantees may be subject to review under applicable federal or state laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference and similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. in certain circumstances, a court could void the guarantees, subordinate amounts owing under the guarantees or order other relief detrimental to the holders of our guaranteed obligations. the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes contain a "savings clause," which limits the liability of each guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum amount that such guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer. this provision may not be effective to protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges or, if it does, it may reduce such guarantor's obligation such that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would not suffice, if necessary, to pay the notes in full when due.
the following tables present summarized financial information for d.r. horton, inc. and the guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis after intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated among d.r. horton, inc. and the guarantor subsidiaries, as well as their investment in, and equity in earnings from the non-guarantor subsidiaries.

seasonality although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future, we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and pre-tax income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. the seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in the working capital requirements for our homebuilding, lot development, financial services and rental operations. as a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year.

critical accounting policies and estimates general - a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of d.r. horton, inc. and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30, 2023 and 2022, and for the years ended september 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021. each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap, we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business, the results of our operations and our financial condition, and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements. the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected.
we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition - we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. our performance obligation, to deliver the agreed-upon home, is generally satisfied in less than one year from the original contract date. proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies are included in homebuilding cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets.
when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers, or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes, we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are cancelled. we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on cancelled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.
revenues associated with our mortgage operations primarily include net gains on the sale of mortgage loans and servicing rights. we typically elect the fair value option for our mortgage loan originations whereby mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and loan values are adjusted through revenues for subsequent changes in fair value until the loans are sold. expected gains and losses from the sale of servicing rights are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through revenues at the time of commitment. we sell substantially all of the mortgages we originate and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers. interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold.
mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions, which can result in repurchases of loans previously sold to investors or payments to reimburse investors for loan losses. based on historical experience, analysis of the volume of mortgages we originated, discussions with our mortgage purchasers and current housing and credit market conditions, we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale, as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests.
inventories and cost of sales - inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land development and construction, capitalized interest, real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and construction. costs that we incur after projects or homes are substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance, and cleaning, are charged to sg&a expense as incurred. all indirect overhead costs, such as compensation of sales personnel, division and region management, and the costs of advertising and builder's risk insurance are charged to sg&a expense as incurred.
land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins. home construction costs are specifically identified and recorded to individual homes. cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community. cost of sales for lots sold includes all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) allocated to each residential lot in the community. any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home or lot closings in a community are generally allocated on a pro-rata basis to the remaining homes or lots in the community associated with the relevant development activity.
when a home is closed, we generally have not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home. we record a liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales for the amount estimated to ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed. we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home. we monitor the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amounts previously accrued. although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals, such differences have not been significant.
at the end of each quarter, we review the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment. we generally review our inventory for impairment indicators at the community level, and the inventory within each community is categorized as land held for development, residential land and lots developed and under development, land held for sale, rental properties and construction in progress and finished homes, based on the stage of production or plans for future development or sale. a particular community often includes inventory in more than one category. in certain situations, inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type or future plans. in reviewing each of our communities, we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the following:
•projected gross margins based on community budgets;
•performance of other communities in nearby locations.
if indicators of impairment are present for a community, we perform an impairment evaluation of the community, which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. if so, impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts. these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development, materials and labor costs which, in turn, may be impacted by the following local market conditions:
•supply and availability of new and existing homes;
•location and desirability of our communities;
•pricing and use of incentives by us and our competitors;
•alternative uses for our land or communities such as the sale of land, finished lots or home sites to third parties;
for those assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. when an impairment charge for a community is determined, the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot. impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities and completed rental properties when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes.
we rarely purchase land for resale. however, when we own land or communities under development that do not fit into our development and construction plans, and we determine that we will sell the asset, the project is accounted for as land held for sale if certain criteria are met. we record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell. in performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale, we consider several factors including, but not limited to, recent offers received to purchase the property, prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions and market analysis studies, which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land. if the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.
the key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market and economic conditions, and are inherently uncertain. although our quarterly assessments reflect management's best estimates, due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could differ from such estimates.
warranty claims - we typically provide our homebuyers with a ten-year limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems, a two-year limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a one-year limited warranty on other construction components. since we subcontract our construction work to subcontractors who typically provide us with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work, claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors. warranty liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered. the amounts charged are based on management's estimate of expected warranty-related costs under all unexpired warranty obligation periods. our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate. actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts. a 10% change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual. for additional information regarding our warranty liability, see note l, "commitments and contingencies," to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
our reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims. at september 30, 2023 and 2022, we had reserves for approximately 600 and 560 pending construction defect claims, respectively, and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements. during fiscal 2023, we were notified of approximately 345 new construction defect claims and resolved 305 construction defect claims for a total cost of $40.6 million. we have closed a significant number of homes during recent years, and we may be subject to future construction defect claims on these homes. although regulations vary from state to state, construction defect issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which we operate. historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where we operate are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and anticipated future claims. these estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change. adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs.
historical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent, and we believe they may continue to fluctuate. we also believe that fluctuations in housing market conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims. if the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from our home closings in prior years varies from current expectations, it could significantly change our estimates regarding the frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims, which would impact the construction defect reserves in the future. if the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly exceed our current estimates, they will have a significant negative impact on our future earnings and liquidity.
we estimate and record receivables under the applicable insurance policies related to our estimated contingencies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable. however, because the self-insured retentions under these policies are significant, we anticipate we will largely be self-insured. additionally, we may have the ability to recover a portion of our losses from our subcontractors and their insurance carriers when we have been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies.
the estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products built, claim frequency, claim settlement costs and patterns, insurance industry practices and legal interpretations, among others. due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these contingencies, actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated amounts. a 10% increase in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim used to estimate the reserves would result in an increase of approximately $148.8 million in our reserves and a $51.8 million increase in our insurance receivable, resulting in additional expense of $97.0 million. a 10% decrease in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately $133.6 million in our reserves and a $46.7 million decrease in our insurance receivable, resulting in a reduction in expense of $86.9 million. for additional information regarding our legal claims reserves, see note l, "commitments and contingencies," to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following management discussion and analysis ("md&a") provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. we provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and reportable segment level. we also provide quantitative information regarding special (gains) and charges, discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature. qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance.
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form 10-k. our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. this discussion contains various non-gaap financial measures and also contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. we refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled "non-gaap financial measures" at the end of this md&a, and "forward-looking statements" and "risk factors" within items 1 and 1a of this form 10-k. we also refer readers to the tables within the section entitled "results of operations" of this md&a for reconciliation information of non-gaap measures to u.s. gaap.
comparability of results purolite acquisition in december 2021, we acquired purolite for total consideration of $3.7 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. purolite is a leading and fast-growing global provider of high-end ion exchange resins for the separation and purification of solutions for pharmaceutical and industrial applications. headquartered in king of prussia, pennsylvania, purolite operates in more than 30 countries. purolite is reported within our life sciences operating segment. acquisition and integration charges are recorded within special (gains) and charges. the 2021 impacts of the purolite acquisition including operating results, acquisition-related amortization and interest expense related to the transaction were also excluded from 2021 adjusted results.
impact of acquisitions and divestitures our non-gaap financial measures for organic sales, organic operating income and organic operating income margin are at fixed currency and exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition and the results of divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture. as part of the separation of championx in 2020, we entered into a master cross supply and product transfer agreement with championx to provide, receive or transfer certain products for a period of 36 months and for a small set of products with limited suppliers over the next few years. sales of product to championx under this agreement are recorded in product and equipment sales in the corporate segment along with the related cost of sales. these transactions are removed from the consolidated results as part of the calculation of the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.
comparability of reportable segments effective january 1, 2023, our former downstream operating segment is now part of the water operating segment. this change did not have any impact on the global industrial reportable segment.
fixed currency foreign exchange rates management evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our non-u.s. dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates, which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations. fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into u.s. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management, with all periods presented using such rates. public currency rate data provided within the "segment performance" section of this md&a reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period and is provided for informational purposes only.
executive summary in 2023, we delivered high single digit sales growth as we continued strong pricing. our strong pricing offset continued delivered product cost increases. our team generated double-digit sales growth in institutional & specialty, high single digit sales growth in industrial, and other segments while healthcare and life sciences generated good sales growth. operating income grew by strong double digits, as strong pricing and cost savings initiatives overcame investments in the business and higher supply chain costs.
gross margin our reported gross margin was 40.2% of sales for 2023, compared to our 2022 reported gross margin of 37.8%. excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges included in cost of sales, our adjusted gross margin was 40.4% in 2023 and 38.2% in 2022. our gross profit increased as our strong pricing exceeded delivered product cost inflation.
reported diluted eps increased 26% to $4.79 in 2023 compared to $3.81 in 2022. special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years. special (gains) and charges in 2023 were driven primarily by restructuring expense and 2022 was driven primarily by restructuring and pension settlement expense. adjusted diluted eps, which excludes the impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items increased 16% to $5.21 in 2023 compared to $4.49 in 2022 as our strong operating income performance was partially offset by foreign currency translation and increases in interest expense.
balance sheet we remain committed to maintaining "a" range ratings metrics over the long-term, supported by our current credit ratings of a-/a3/a- by standard & poor's, moody's investor services and fitch, respectively. our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates.
cash flow cash flow from operating activities was $2.4 billion in 2023 compared to $1.8 billion in 2022. we continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, investments in our business, acquisitions, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments.
dividends dividends declared per common share in 2023 was $2.16 per share. in december 2023 we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 8% to $0.57 per share, representing our 32nd consecutive annual dividend rate increase. we have paid cash dividends on our common shares for 87 consecutive years. our outstanding dividend history reflects our long-term growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap. our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements ("notes").
preparation of our consolidated financial statements, in conformity with u.s. gaap, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.
besides estimates that meet the "critical" estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. all estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even from estimates not deemed critical. our critical accounting estimates include the following:
revenue recognition revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing service. revenue from product and sold equipment is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer of the product or delivery of the equipment. revenue from service and leased equipment is recognized when the services are provided, or the customer receives the benefit from the leased equipment, which is over time. service revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method and aligns with when the services are provided. typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date because the effort provided by the field selling and service organization represents services provided, which corresponds with the transfer of control. revenue for leased equipment is accounted for under topic 842 leases and recognized on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease contract.
our revenue policies do not provide for general rights of return. we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives based primarily on historical experience and anticipated performance over the contract period. depending on market conditions, we may increase customer incentive offerings, which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive. we also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits based on specific circumstances and credit conditions. we record an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on our estimates of expected future credit losses.
the revenue standard can be applied to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics if it is reasonable that the effects of applying the standard at the portfolio would not be significantly different than applying the standard at the individual contract level. we apply the portfolio approach primarily within each operating segment by geographical region. application of the portfolio approach was focused on those characteristics that have the most significant accounting consequences in terms of their effect on the timing of revenue recognition or the amount of revenue recognized. we determined the key criteria to assess with respect to the portfolio approach, including the related deliverables, the characteristics of the customers and the timing and transfer of goods and services, which most closely aligned within the operating segments. in addition, the accountability for the business operations, as well as the operational decisions on how to go to market and the product offerings, are performed at the operating segment level. for additional information on revenue recognition, refer to note 17.
litigation and environmental liabilities our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations.
we record liabilities related to pending litigation, environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs. we record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses. expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain. while the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals, and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position. for additional information on our commitments and contingencies, refer to note 15.
actuarially determined liabilities pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans the measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries in their valuations and calculations. these assumptions affect the amount and timing of future pension contributions, benefit payments and expense or income recognized.
the significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rates, expected returns on assets, projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality tables.
●   the discount rate assumptions for our u.s. plans are assessed using a yield curve constructed from a subset of bonds yielding greater than the median return from a population of non-callable, corporate bonds that have an average rating of aa when averaging available moody's investor services, standard &amp; poor's and fitch ratings. the discount rates are calculated by matching each plans' projected cash flows to the bond yield curve. for 2023 and 2022, we measured service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows. we believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans' liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. in determining our u.s. pension obligations for 2023, our weighted-average discount rate decreased to 4.95% from 5.17% at year-end 2022. in determining our u.s. postretirement health care obligation for 2023, our weighted-average discount rate decreased to 4.95% from 5.14% at year-end 2022.
●   for postretirement benefit measurement purposes as of december 31, 2023, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed to be 7.46% for pre-65 costs. post-65 costs are no longer used. the rates are assumed to decrease each year until they reach 4.5% in 2034 and remain at those levels thereafter.
●   we use mortality tables appropriate in the circumstances, which generally are the recently available mortality tables as of the respective u.s. and international measurement dates. our year-end u.s. valuations reflect mortality tables that estimate the impacts of covid in an endemic state. this represents a change from prior year when the impact of covid on future mortality could not be reasonably estimated.
the effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of december 31, 2023, on the december 31, 2023 defined benefit obligation and 2024 expense is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels. expense amounts reflect the accounting for gains or losses as a component of other comprehensive income or expense and recognition of the impacts into earnings over time:
effect on u.s. postretirement health care benefits plans increase in              higher assumption         recorded                 2024
our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans, with the majority of the amounts held in the u.k. and eurozone countries. we use assumptions similar to our u.s. plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations, however, the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information.
refer to note 16 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies, estimates, funded status, contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations.
self-insurance globally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses. we are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles, subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles. we are self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. we determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis.
income taxes judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits.
effective income tax rate our effective income tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of unrecognized tax benefits. we recognize the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. we adjust these liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in light of changing facts and circumstances.
tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. as a result, the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns. some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense.
deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. based on the evaluation of available evidence, both positive and negative, we recognize tax assets, such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not. relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results, sources of future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes.
unrecognized tax benefits a number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter, for which we have established a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, is audited and finally resolved. the number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. the internal revenue service ("irs") has completed examinations of our u.s. federal income tax returns through 2016 and the years 2017 through 2020 are currently under audit. in addition to the u.s. federal examinations, we have ongoing audit activity in several u.s. state and foreign jurisdictions.
the tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal, state and international jurisdictions. we believe our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations, and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken. because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations, we have established a liability for potential reductions of tax benefits (including related interest and penalties) for amounts that do not meet the more-likely-than-not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance. the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is reviewed throughout the year, taking into account new legislation, regulations, case law and audit results. settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts, cash payments or receipts and/or adjustments to tax expense. liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are presented in the consolidated balance sheets within other non-current liabilities. our gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $24.2 million and $24.9 million as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. for additional information on income taxes refer to note 12.
long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill long-lived and amortizable intangible assets purchased long-lived and amortizable intangible assets not acquired as part of a business combination are recorded as of their acquisition date at cost, whereas long-lived and amortizable assets acquired as part of a business combination are recorded as of their acquisition date at their fair values based on the fair value requirements defined in u.s. gaap. this requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions relating to the present value of its future cash flows, such as growth rates, royalty rates or discount rates.
we review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $6.3 billion as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, for impairment when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the manner in which asset or asset groups are being used or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset or asset group. impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset's or assets group's carrying amount over its estimated fair value.
we use the straight-line method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets, including our customer relationships. we consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships, including projected sales data, customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships.
globally, we have a broad customer base. our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions, including the customer bases acquired from our nalco, laboratoires anios ("anios"), copal invest nv, including its primary operating entity cid lines (collectively, "cid lines") and purolite transactions, which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships. our historical retention rates, coupled with our consistent track record of keeping long-term relationships with our customers, supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer bases. if our customer retention rates or other post-acquisition operational activities change materially, we would evaluate the financial impacts and significance of the events given rise to the change which could result in impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets, or absent an impairment, an acceleration of amortization expense.
in addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. we have experienced no significant changes in the carrying amount or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets.
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets goodwill arises from our acquisitions and represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration exchanged over the fair value of net assets acquired. we had total goodwill of $8.1 billion and $8.0 billion as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. our reporting units are our ten operating segments. we assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the second quarter. if circumstances change or events occur that demonstrate it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we complete an interim goodwill impairment assessment of that reporting unit prior to the next annual assessment. if the results of an annual or interim goodwill impairment assessment demonstrate the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, we will recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, but not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to that reporting unit.
for our annual 2023 goodwill impairment assessment, we completed our impairment assessment for our ten reporting units using discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated assumptions regarding future growth rates, terminal values and discount rates. our goodwill impairment assessments for 2023 indicated the estimated fair values of each of these ten reporting units exceeded the carrying amounts of the respective reporting units by a significant margin. we evaluate the need to complete interim goodwill impairment assessments when significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may be higher than its fair value. no events were noted during the second half of 2023 that required completion of an interim goodwill impairment assessment in the second half of 2023 for any of our ten reporting units. there has been no impairment of goodwill in any of the periods presented.
the nalco trade name is our only indefinite life intangible asset, which is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the second quarter. for our annual 2023 indefinite life intangible asset impairment assessment, we completed our impairment assessment of the nalco trade name using the relief from royalty discounted cash flow method, which incorporates assumptions regarding future sales projections, royalty rates and discount rates. our nalco tradename impairment assessment for 2023 indicated the estimated fair value of the nalco trade name exceeded its $1.2 billion carrying amount by a significant margin. no events were noted during the second half of 2023 that required completion of an interim impairment assessment of our nalco trade name in the second half of 2023. there has been no impairment of the nalco trade name intangible since it was acquired.

our reported gross margin was 40.2%, 37.8%, and 40.2% for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. our 2023, 2022 and 2021 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special (gains) and charges of $22.5 million, $69.9 million, and $93.9 million, respectively. special (gains) and charges items impacting cos are shown within the "special (gains) and charges" table below.
excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges and the 2021 impacts of the purolite transaction, our adjusted gross margin was 38.2% and 40.9% for 2022 and 2021, respectively. the decrease primarily reflected accelerating pricing that was more than offset by higher delivered product cost and unfavorable mix.
the increased sg&a ratio (sg&a expenses as a percentage of reported net sales) comparing 2023 against 2022 was driven by higher incentive compensation compared to last year which was partially offset by strong productivity including cost savings initiatives. the decreased sg&a ratio (sg&a expenses as a percentage of reported net sales) comparing 2022 against 2021 was driven primarily by strong productivity including cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher cost of compensation compared to last year.
special (gains) and charges special (gains) and charges reported on the consolidated statements of income included the following items:
cost of sales restructuring activities                          $22.5                  $21.4                 $24.7

acquisition and integration activities            16.1                    14.5                  29.9
for segment reporting purposes, special (gains) and charges are not allocated to reportable segments, which is consistent with our internal management reporting.
restructuring activities restructuring activities are primarily related to the combined program which is described below. these activities have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges, and other (income) expense on the consolidated statements of income. restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
combined program in november 2022, we approved a europe cost savings program. in connection with these actions, we expected to incur pre-tax charges of $130 million ($110 million after tax) or $0.38 per diluted share. in february 2023, we expanded our previously announced europe cost savings program to focus on its institutional and healthcare businesses in other regions. in connection with the expanded program ("combined program"), we expect to incur total pre-tax charges of $195 million ($150 million after tax) or $0.52 per diluted share. we expect that these restructuring charges will be completed by the end of 2024. program actions include headcount reductions from terminations, not filling certain open positions, and facility closures. the combined program charges are expected to be primarily cash expenditures related to severance and asset disposals.
in anticipation of this combined program, a limited number of actions were taken in the fourth quarter of 2022. as a result, we reclassified $19.3 million ($14.5 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share from other restructuring to the combined program in the first quarter of 2023.
in 2023 and 2022 we recorded total combined program restructuring charges of $77.7 million ($66.4 million after tax) or $0.23 per diluted share and $67.2 million ($56.0 million after tax) or $0.20 per diluted share, respectively. we have recorded $164.2 million ($136.9 million after tax), or $0.48 per diluted share of cumulative charges under the combined plan. the net liability related to the combined program was $43.1 million and $62.0 million as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the remaining liability is expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and will continue to be funded from operating activities.
the combined program has delivered $131 million of cumulative cost savings with estimated annualized cost savings of $175 million in continuing operations by 2024.
institutional advancement program we approved a restructuring plan in 2020 focused on the institutional business ("the institutional plan") which is intended to enhance our institutional sales and service structure and allow the sales team to capture share and penetration while maximizing service effectiveness by leveraging our ongoing investments in digital technology.
in 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded total restructuring charges of $8.0 million ($6.0 million after tax) or $0.03 per diluted share, $6.3 million ($4.8 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share and $12.6 million ($10.2 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share, respectively, primarily related to severance, disposals of equipment and office closures. the restructuring activities were completed at the end of 2023, with total costs of $62.1 million ($47.4 million after tax), or $0.17 per diluted share. net cash payments were $2.6 million and non-cash net charges were $6.8 million in 2023. there was no remaining liability related to the institutional plan as of december 31, 2023. there was $1.9 million of liability related to the institutional plan of december 31, 2022.
the institutional plan has delivered $55 million of annual cost savings.
during 2018, we formally commenced a restructuring plan accelerate 2020 ("the a2020 plan"), to leverage technology and system investments and organizational changes. the goals of the a2020 plan were to further simplify and automate processes and tasks, reduce complexity and management layers, consolidate facilities and focus on key long-term growth areas by further leveraging technology and structural improvements. we recorded restructuring charges of $9.9 million ($8.4 million after tax) or $0.03 per diluted share and $5.3 million ($6.2 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share in 2022 and 2021, respectively. the restructuring activities were completed at the end of 2022, with total costs of $254.4 million ($198.4 million after tax), or $0.69 per diluted share.
net cash payments were $13.2 million during 2023. the liability related to the a2020 plan was $4.9 million and $18.1 million as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the remaining liability is expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters which continue to be funded from operating activities.
other restructuring activities during 2022 and 2021, we incurred restructuring charges of $23.8 million ($17.9 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share and $18.7 million ($17.0 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share, respectively, related to other immaterial restructuring activity. the charges primarily related to severance and asset write-offs.
the restructuring liability balance for all other restructuring plans excluding the combined program, a2020 plan and the institutional plan were $3.3 million and $23.2 million as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the decrease in liability was driven primarily by the reclass of $19.3 million from other restructuring to the combined program in the first quarter of 2023. the remaining liability is expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and will continue to be funded from operating activities. cash payments during 2023 related to all other restructuring plans excluding the combined program, a2020 and institutional plan were $0.6 million.
acquisition and integration related costs acquisition and integration related costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the consolidated statements of income in 2023 include $16.1 million ($12.0 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share. charges are integration related costs primarily related to the purolite corporation ("purolite") acquisition.

our reported operating income was $1,992.3 million, $1,562.5 million and $1,598.6 for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. our 2023, 2022 and 2021 operating incomes were negatively impacted by special (gains) and charges and the 2021 impact of purolite on operating income of $133.9 million, $210.4 million, and $200.3 million, respectively.
excluding the impacts of special (gains) and charges 2023 adjusted operating income increased 20% as strong pricing overcame investments in the business including incentive compensation, higher supply chain costs and unfavorable mix. excluding the impacts of special (gains) and the 2021 impact of purolite on operating income 2022 adjusted operating income decreased 1% driven by accelerating pricing covering substantially higher delivered product costs, which was offset by investments in the business.
our reported other income was $59.9 million, $24.5 million and $33.9 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. other (income) expense increased when comparing 2023 against 2022 as higher pension costs were more than offset by the comparison to last year's $50.6 million settlement expense related to u.s. pension plan lump-sum payments to retirees. other (income) expense decreased when comparing 2022 against 2021 primarily due to increased pension settlement charges in 2022 as a result of a higher volume of pension settlement activity and higher interest costs associated with rising interest rates throughout 2022. excluding the impact of settlements and curtailments recorded in special (gains) and charges during 2023, 2022 and 2021, our adjusted other income was $59.9 million, $75.1 million and $71.1 million, respectively.

we incurred $33.1 million ($29.0 million after tax) or $0.10 per diluted share of interest expense special charges in conjunction with our debt issuances and refinancing activities during 2021.
adjusted for special (gains) and charges, the increase in interest expense when comparing 2023 against 2022 was driven primarily by the higher average interest rates on outstanding debt. adjusted for special (gains) and charges, the increase in interest expense when comparing 2022 against 2021 was driven primarily by the interest on debt issued to fund the purolite acquisition and the impact from higher average interest rates on floating rate debt.

we continue to generate cash flow from operations allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in the business and pension obligations along with returning cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases.
cash provided by operating activities increased $623 million in 2023 compared to 2022, driven primarily by a $332 million net favorable change in working capital and $284 million increase in net income. the cash flow impact from working capital was primarily driven by improvement in inventory due to management efforts following easing global supply chain constraints and an improvement in receivables offset by a decrease in accounts payable primarily associated with our inventory reduction efforts.
cash provided by operating activities decreased $274 million in 2022 compared to 2021, driven primarily by $277 million increase in working capital. the increase in working capital is primarily driven by past due receivables higher than last year due to pricing and energy surcharge rollout. additionally, inventory impacted by inflationary environment and higher stock holding to mitigate supply disruption.

our cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the issuances and repayment of debt, common stock repurchases, proceeds from common stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs and dividend payments.
there were no long-term debt issuances in 2023. we repaid $500 million of long-term debt in 2023. we issued $500 million par value and received $494 million in proceeds of long-term debt in 2022. we issued $2,800 million par value and received $2,775 million in proceeds of long-term debt and repaid $900 million of long-term debt in 2021.the proceeds received from the debt issuances were used for the purolite acquisition, repayment of outstanding debt, repayment of commercial paper and general corporate purposes. in addition, we had net repayments of $2 million and $404 million of commercial paper and notes payable in 2023 and 2022, respectively, and net issuances of $394 million in 2021.
shares are repurchased for the purpose of partially offsetting the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans, to manage our capital structure and to efficiently return capital to shareholders. we repurchased a total of $14 million, $518 million, and $107 million of shares in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
liquidity and capital resources we currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for the next twelve months, including scheduled debt repayments, new investments in the business, share repurchases, dividend payments, possible business acquisitions and pension and postretirement contributions with cash from operating activities, and as needed, additional short-term and/or long-term borrowings. we continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong.
as of december 31, 2023, we had $920 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $880 million was held outside of the u.s. as of december 31, 2022, we had $599 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $122 million was held outside of the u.s. our cash balance is intended to fund current maturities of long-term debt. we will continue to evaluate our cash position in light of future developments.
as of december 31, 2023, we had a $2.0 billion multi-year credit facility, which expires in april 2026. the credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks and supports our u.s. and euro commercial paper programs. the maximum aggregate amount of commercial paper that may be issued under our u.s. commercial paper program and our euro commercial paper program may not exceed $2.0 billion. at year end, we had no commercial paper outstanding under our u.s. program nor our euro program. there were no borrowings under our credit facility as of december 31, 2023 or 2022. as of december 31, 2023, both programs were rated a-2 by standard & poor's, p-2 by moody's and f-1 by fitch.
additionally, we have uncommitted credit lines with major international banks and financial institutions. these credit lines support our daily global funding needs, primarily our global cash pooling structures. as of december 31, 2023 we had $155 million of bank supported letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees outstanding in support of our commercial business transactions. we do not have any other significant unconditional purchase obligations or commercial commitments.
as of december 31, 2023, standard & poor's, fitch and moody's rated our long-term credit at a- (negative outlook), a- (stable outlook) and a3 (negative outlook), respectively. a reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or negotiate new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities.
as of december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures.

as of december 31, 2023, our gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $24 million. we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required. therefore, these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.
we do not have required minimum cash contribution obligations for our qualified pension plans in 2023. we are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements. we estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate $47 million in 2024. these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.
we lease certain sales and administrative office facilities, distribution centers, research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longer-term operating leases. vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration. vehicle leases have residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles.
market risk we enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing monitoring and reporting, and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows.

based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10% change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increase/decrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately $169 million. the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.
global economic and political environment global economies approximately half of our sales are outside of the u.s. our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results.
argentina and turkey are classified as highly inflationary economies in accordance with u.s. gaap, and the u.s. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in argentina and turkey. during 2023, sales in argentina and turkey represented less than 1% of our consolidated sales. assets held in argentina and turkey at the end of 2023 represented less than 1% of our consolidated assets.
in light of russia's invasion of ukraine and the sanctions against russia by the united states and other countries, we have made the determination that we will limit our russian business to operations that are essential to life, providing minimal support for our healthcare, life sciences, food and beverage and certain water businesses. we may further narrow our presence in russia depending on future developments. our russian and ukraine operations represented approximately 1% of our 2023 consolidated net sales. we recorded charges of $1.4 million and $13.1 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily related to recoverability risk of certain assets in both russia and ukraine.
non-gaap financial measures this md&a includes financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap. these non-gaap measures include:
●  organic sales, formerly known as acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales
●  organic operating income, formerly known as acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income
●  organic operating income margin, formerly known as acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margin
●  ebitda
●  adjusted diluted eps we provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. we use these non-gaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.
our non-gaap adjusted financial measure for net sales excludes 2021 purolite sales. our non-gaap adjusted financial measures for cost of sales, gross margin, operating income, other (income) expense and interest expense exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges and (with the exception of other (income) expense) the 2021 impact of the purolite transaction, and our non-gaap measures for tax rate, net income attributable to ecolab and diluted eps further exclude the impact of discrete tax items. we include items within special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items that we believe can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results. after tax special (gains) and charges are derived by applying the applicable local jurisdictional tax rate to the corresponding pre-tax special (gains) and charges.
ebitda is defined as the sum of net income including non-controlling interest, provision for income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization. ebitda is used in our net debt to ebitda ratio, which we view as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization.
our reportable segments do not include the impact of intangible asset amortization from the nalco and purolite transactions or the impact of special (gains) and charges as these are not allocated to our reportable segments.
our non-gaap financial measures for organic sales, organic operating income and organic operating income margin are at fixed currency and exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition and the results of divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture. as part of the separation of championx in 2020, we entered into a master cross supply and product transfer agreement with championx to provide, receive or transfer certain products for a period up to 36 months and for a small set of products with limited suppliers over the next few years. sales of product to championx under this agreement are recorded in product and equipment sales in the corporate segment along with the related cost of sales. these transactions are removed from the consolidated results as part of the calculation of the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.
these non-gaap measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to u.s. gaap and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. we recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the u.s. gaap measures included in this md&a and we have provided reconciliations of reported u.s. gaap amounts to the non-gaap amounts in this md&a.

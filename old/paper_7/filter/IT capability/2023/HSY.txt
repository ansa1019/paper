•critical accounting policies and estimates business model and growth strategy we are the largest producer of quality chocolate in north america, a leading snack maker in the united states and a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery. we report our operations through three segments: (i) north america confectionery, (ii) north america salty snacks and (iii) international, as discussed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
our vision is to be a leading snacking powerhouse. we aspire to be a leader in meeting consumers' evolving snacking needs while strengthening the capabilities that drive our growth. we are focused on four strategic imperatives to ensure the company's success now and in the future:
•drive core confection business and broaden participation in snacking. we continue to be the undisputed leader in u.s. confection by taking actions to deepen our consumer connections and utilize our beloved brands to deliver meaningful innovation, while also diversifying our portfolio to capture profitable and incremental growth across the broader snacking continuum.
◦our products frequently play an important role in special moments among family and friends. seasons are an important part of our business model and for consumers, as they are highly anticipated, cherished times, centered around traditions. for us, it's an opportunity for our brands to be part of many connections during the year when family and friends gather.
◦innovation is an important lever in this variety-seeking category and we are leveraging work from our proprietary demand landscape analytical tool to shape our future innovation and make it more impactful. we are becoming more disciplined in our focus on platform innovation, which should enable sustainable growth over time and significant extensions to our core.
◦to expand our breadth in snacking and become a leading snacking powerhouse, we are focused on continuing to expand the boundaries of our core confection brands to capture new snacking occasions and increasing our exposure into new snack categories through acquisitions. our expansion into snacking was fueled by the acquisitions of dot's and pretzels in december 2021 and the acquisition of weaver in 2023, which are included in our north america salty snacks segment.
•deliver profitable international growth. we are focused on ensuring that we efficiently allocate our resources to the areas with the highest potential for profitable growth. we have reset our international investment strategy, while holding fast to our belief that our targeted emerging market strategy will deliver long-term, profitable growth. the uncertain macroeconomic environment in many of these markets is expected to continue and we aim to ensure our investments in these international markets are appropriate relative to the size of the opportunity.

•expand competitive advantage through differentiated capabilities. in order to generate actionable insights, we must acquire, integrate, access and utilize vast sources of the right data in an effective manner. we are working to leverage our advanced data and analytical techniques to gain a deep understanding of our consumers, our customers, our shoppers, our end-to-end supply chain, our retail environment and key economic drivers at both a macro and precision level, including digital transformation and new media models. in addition, we are in the process of transforming our supply chain capabilities and enterprise resource planning system, which will enable employees to work more efficiently and effectively.
•responsibly manage our operations to ensure the long-term sustainability of our business, our planet and our people. we are a purpose-driven company and for more than a century, our iconic brands have been built on a foundation of community investment and connections between people around the world. we could not have achieved this without our remarkable employees who make our purpose a reality. we believe our long-standing values make our company a special place to work.
◦we believe our employees are among our most important resources and are critical to our continued success. we utilize continuous listening surveys that are distributed throughout the year to all employees globally to hear their thoughts on the company's direction and their place in it. these continuous touchpoints allow for real-time feedback and action from the company. these surveys are further supplemented with quarterly and informative enterprise and team town halls, which, in conjunction with the continuous listening surveys, generate stronger employee engagement with the company's strategy, initiatives and leadership.
◦our diverse and inclusive culture makes the difference across all areas of the business. our gender representation includes women occupying many of the top positions in the company, including chief executive officer and chairman of the board, chief accounting officer and president, salty snacks, and approximately 50% representation across the company. in 2023, we maintained fair and equitable pay achievements, including 1:1 aggregate people of color pay equity (2021) and 1:1 aggregate gender pay (2020) for salaried employees in the united states.
◦we continue to make progress on our esg priorities and continue to elevate these esg initiatives for a greater global impact. through our focus on sustainability and social impact across our value chain, we continue to improve and focus on the lives of cocoa farmers and cocoa communities, the environmental priorities of climate change and the role of packaging in our business, responsibly and sustainably sourcing the inputs to our products and increasing investments in human rights and diversity initiatives and growing diverse representation across the organization.

trends affecting our business throughout 2023, the rate of inflation has slowed; however, negative macroeconomic conditions and future outlook, including fears of a pending recession, have negatively impacted consumer behaviors. net sales and net income increased during the year ended december 31, 2023; however, this was primarily driven by price increases on certain products across our portfolio. additionally, we continued to experience corresponding incremental costs and gross margin pressures during the year ended december 31, 2023 (see consolidated results of operations included in this md&a). despite specific actions taken to mitigate these gross margin pressures, higher prices for direct materials used to manufacture our products were, and continue to be, the primary incremental cost to our business. we utilize many exchange traded commodities for our business that are subject to price volatility, specifically cocoa products, which experienced an average increase in market prices of approximately 32% during 2023. we continue to monitor and use our risk management strategy where possible to hedge commodity prices in order to mitigate corresponding increases in our raw materials and energy costs.
furthermore, certain geopolitical events, specifically the conflict between russia and ukraine, have increased global economic and political uncertainty. for the year ended december 31, 2023, this conflict did not have a material impact on our commodity prices or supply availability. however, we are continuing to monitor for any significant escalation or expansion of economic or supply chain disruptions or broader inflationary costs, which may result in material adverse effects on our results of operations.
as of december 31, 2023, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our key strategic initiatives and other material cash requirements in both the short-term and in the long-term; however, we continue to evaluate and take action, as necessary, to preserve adequate liquidity and ensure that our business can operate effectively during the current economic environment. we continue to monitor our discretionary spending across the organization (see liquidity and capital resources included in this md&a).
based on the length and severity of fluctuating levels of inflation, including price volatility for our commodities, the likelihood of a potential recession, changes in consumer shopping and consumption behavior, and changes in geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine, we may experience increasing supply chain costs, higher inflation and other impacts to our business. we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of these potential and evolving impacts on our business, consolidated results of operations, segment results, liquidity and capital resources.

net sales were $11,165.0 million in 2023 compared to $10,419.3 million in 2022, an increase of $745.7 million, or 7.2%. the net sales increase reflects a favorable price realization of 8.3% due to higher list prices across all segments and by a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 0.2%. these increases were slightly offset by a volume decrease of 1.3% due to a decrease in consumer demand primarily in everyday core u.s. confection brands.
2022 compared with 2021
net sales were $10,419.3 million in 2022 compared to $8,971.3 million in 2021, an increase of $1,448.0 million, or 16.1%. the net sales increase reflects a volume increase of 8.0% due to higher prices on certain products, a 4.3% benefit from net acquisitions and divestitures driven by the 2021 acquisitions of lily's, dot's and pretzels and a volume increase of 4.0% due to an increase in consumer demand primarily in everyday core u.s. confection brands and salty snack brands. these increases were slightly offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 0.2%.

gross margin was 44.8% in 2023 compared with 43.2% in 2022, an increase of 160 basis points. the increase was driven by favorable price realization and increased supply chain productivity. the increase was partially offset by unfavorable activity on our mark-to-market impact from commodity derivative instruments, higher supply chain costs, including higher labor costs and increased waste. the increase was further driven by unfavorable mix and foreign exchange rates.
2022 compared with 2021
cost of sales were $5,920.5 million in 2022 compared with $4,922.7 million in 2021, an increase of $997.8 million, or 20.3%. the increase included $767.7 million of unfavorable costs driven by higher sales volume and higher supply chain inflation costs, including higher logistics and labor costs. the increase was further driven by an incremental $40.8 million of unfavorable mark-to-market activity on our commodity derivative instruments intended to economically hedge future years' commodity purchases. additionally, we incurred incremental costs of $263.3 million associated with our 2021 acquisitions of dot's and pretzels. these increases were offset by $74.0 million of favorable price realization and supply chain productivity.
gross margin was 43.2% in 2022 compared with 45.1% 2021, a decrease of 190 basis points. the decrease was driven by unfavorable year-over-year mark-to-market impact from commodity derivative instruments, higher supply chain inflation costs, including higher logistics and labor costs, and unfavorable product mix. these declines were offset by favorable price realization and volume increases.

sm&a expenses were $2,236.0 million in 2022 compared to $2,001.4 million in 2021, an increase of $234.6 million, or 11.7%, driven by increased corporate expenses. total advertising and related consumer marketing expenses increased 2.7% driven by advertising increases in our confectionery brands and increased investment in our salty snacks portfolio, which were partially offset by cost efficiencies related to new media partners. sm&a expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, increased approximately 16.3% in 2022 driven by an increase in acquisition and integration related costs, as well as higher compensation costs, investments in capabilities and technology and broad-based marketplace inflation.

segment results the summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our three segments: north america confectionery, north america salty snacks and international. for segment reporting purposes, we use "segment income" to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. segment income excludes unallocated general corporate administrative expenses, unallocated mark-to-market gains and losses on commodity derivatives, business realignment and impairment charges, acquisition-related costs and other unusual gains or losses that are not part of our measurement of segment performance. these items of our operating income are largely managed centrally at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment income reviewed by the chief operating decision maker and used for resource allocation and internal management reporting and performance evaluation. segment income and segment income margin, which are presented in the segment discussion that follows, are non-gaap measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance. we believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors, as they exclude the activities that are not directly attributable to our ongoing segment operations.

liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. significant factors affecting liquidity include cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, repurchases of outstanding shares, the adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. we generate substantial amounts of cash from operations and remain in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for capital reinvestment, strategic acquisitions and the payment of dividends.

operating activities our principal source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. our net income and, consequently, our cash provided by operations are impacted by sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, timing of new product introductions, profit margins and price changes. sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. generally, working capital needs peak during the summer months. we meet these needs primarily with cash on hand, bank borrowings or the issuance of commercial paper.
we generated cash of $2.32 billion from operating activities in 2023, a decrease of $4.6 million compared to $2.33 billion in 2022. the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was mainly driven by the following factors:
•in the aggregate, select net working capital items, specifically, trade accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, consumed cash of $209.0 million in 2023, compared to $8.6 million in 2022. this $200.4 million fluctuation was mainly driven by mainly driven by an increase in cash used by accounts receivable due to an increase in sales of u.s. seasonal products and the timing of vendor and supplier payments.
•timing of income tax payments contributed to a decrease in operating cash of $32.5 million in 2023, compared to an increase of $5.0 million in 2022. this $37.5 million fluctuation was primarily due to the variance in actual tax the hershey company | 2023 form 10-k | page 33
expense for 2023 relative to the timing of quarterly estimated tax payments. we paid cash of $303.9 million for income taxes during 2023 compared to $221.3 million in the same period of 2022.
•other assets and liabilities consumed cash of $100.4 million in 2023, compared to $25.7 million in 2022. this $74.7 million fluctuation was primarily due to our purchase of an irrevocable group annuity contract to settle a portion of our post retirement benefit obligation.
•the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by the following net cash inflows:
◦net income adjusted for non-cash charges to operations (including depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, write-down of equity investments and other charges) resulted in $256.7 million of higher cash flow in 2023 relative to 2022.
we generated cash of $2.3 billion from operating activities in 2022, an increase of $244.9 million compared to $2.1 billion in 2021. this increase in net cash provided by operating activities was mainly driven by the following factors:
•in the aggregate, select net working capital items, specifically, trade accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, consumed cash of $9 million in 2022 and generated cash of $47 million in 2021. this $56 million fluctuation was mainly driven by a higher year-over-year build up of u.s. inventories to satisfy product requirements and maintain sufficient levels to accommodate customer requirements, partially offset by the timing of vendor and supplier payments.
•net income adjusted for non-cash charges to operations (including depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, write-down of equity investments and other charges) resulted in $348 million of higher cash flow in 2022 relative to 2021.
pension and post-retirement activity. we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $43.2 million, $36.3 million and $28.4 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, relating to our benefit plans (including our defined benefit and other post retirement plans). the main drivers of fluctuations in expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our long-term estimates, including discount rates used to value the service and interest costs and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses.
the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates and the level of funding. we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements. cash contributions to our pension and post retirement plans totaled $27.6 million, $78.5 million and $51.1 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
investing activities our principal uses of cash for investment purposes relate to purchases of property, plant and equipment and capitalized software, as well as acquisitions of businesses, partially offset by proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment. we used cash of $1.2 billion for investing activities in 2023 compared to $0.8 billion in 2022, with the increase in cash spend driven by an increase of investments in capabilities and technology as well as a higher level of acquisition activity. we used cash of $2.2 billion for investing activities in 2021, with the decrease in 2022 in cash spend driven by lower levels of acquisition activity, partially offset by higher capital spend and investment tax credits.
primary investing activities include the following:
•capital spending. capital expenditures, including capitalized software, primarily to support our erp system implementation, capacity expansion, innovation and cost savings, were $771.1 million in 2023, $519.5 million in 2022 and $495.9 million in 2021. for each of the years presented, our expenditures increased due to progress on capacity expansion projects and our erp system implementation. we expect 2024 capital expenditures, including capitalized software, to approximate $600 million to $650 million. the decrease in our 2024 capital expenditures is largely driven by the wind down of our key strategic initiatives, including completion of the upgrade of a new erp system across the enterprise in 2024. we intend to use our existing cash and internally generated funds to meet our 2024 capital requirements.

approximately 80% of the balance of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2023 was held by subsidiaries domiciled outside of the united states. a majority of this balance is distributable to the united states without material tax implications, such as withholding tax. we intend to continue to reinvest the remainder of the earnings outside of the united states for which there would be a material tax implication to distributing for the foreseeable future and, therefore, have not recognized additional tax expense on these earnings. we believe that our existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt. operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various short- and long-term cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures.
we maintain debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders' equity. our total short- and long-term debt was $4.8 billion at december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022. our total debt remained consistent in 2023 primarily due to the repayment of $250 million of 2.625% notes and $500 million of 3.375% notes due upon their maturity in may 2023 offset by the issuance of $350 million of 4.250% notes due in may 2028 and $400 million of 4.500% notes due in may 2033.
as a source of short-term financing, we maintain a $1.35 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with the option to increase borrowings by an additional $500 million with the consent of the lenders. as of december 31, 2023, the termination date of this agreement is april 26, 2028, however, we may extend the termination date for up to two additional one-year periods upon notice to the administrative agent under the facility. we may use these funds for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions. as of december 31, 2023, we had $822 million of available capacity under the agreement. the unsecured revolving credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants, customary representations, warranties and events of default. we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31, 2023.
in addition to the revolving credit facility, we maintain lines of credit in various currencies with domestic and international commercial banks. as of december 31, 2023, we had available capacity of $219 million under these lines of credit.
furthermore, we have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec that allows for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities. proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the current registration statement may be used for general corporate requirements, including reducing existing borrowings, financing capital additions and funding contributions to our pension plans, future business acquisitions and working capital requirements.
our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk-based interest rates is partly a function of our existing cash-flow-to-debt and debt-to-capitalization levels as well as our current credit rating.
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt. operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various short- and long-term cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures.

equity structure we have two classes of stock outstanding - common stock and class b stock. holders of the common stock and the class b stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders, including the election of directors. holders of the common stock have 1 vote per share. holders of the class b stock have 10 votes per share. holders of the common stock, voting separately as a class, are entitled to elect one-sixth of our board. with respect to dividend rights, holders of the common stock are entitled to cash dividends 10% higher than those declared and paid on the class b stock.
hershey trust company, as trustee for the trust established by milton s. and catherine s. hershey that has as its sole beneficiary milton hershey school, maintains voting control over the hershey company. in addition, three representatives of hershey trust company currently serve as members of the company's board. in performing their responsibilities on the company's board, these representatives may from time to time exercise influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board or management. hershey trust company, as trustee for the trust, in its role as controlling stockholder of the company, has indicated it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company. the company's board, and not the hershey trust company board, is solely responsible and accountable for the company's management and performance.
pennsylvania law requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in hershey trust company, as trustee for the trust, no longer having voting control of the company. the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over hershey trust company, as trustee for the trust, to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations. this legislation makes it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby may delay or prevent a change in control of the company.
material cash requirements the following table summarizes our future material cash requirements as of december 31, 2023:
unconditional purchase obligations (4)                                    2,891.8                          2,111.1                           631.2                          28.4                             121.1
(1) includes the net interest payments on fixed rate debt associated with long-term notes.
(2) includes the minimum rental commitments (including imputed interest) under non-cancelable operating leases primarily for offices, retail stores, warehouses and distribution facilities.
(3) includes the minimum rental commitments (including imputed interest) under non-cancelable finance leases primarily for offices and warehouse facilities, as well as machinery and equipment and vehicles.
(4) purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for the purchase of raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business. amounts presented include fixed price forward contracts and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december 31, 2023. the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities at year-end 2023, nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans, but are not obligated to incur. such amounts are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. we do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.
the hershey company | 2023 form 10-k | page 38
in entering into contractual obligations, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution, conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties. our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates. we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults.
these obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs. to meet those cash requirements, we intend to use our existing cash and internally generated funds. to the extent necessary, we may also borrow under our existing unsecured revolving credit facility or under other short-term borrowings, and depending on market conditions and upon the significance of the cost of a particular note maturity or acquisition to our then-available sources of funds, to obtain additional short- and long-term financing. we believe that cash provided from these sources will be adequate to meet our future short- and long-term cash requirements.
asset retirement obligations we have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities. our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations, which require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a specified manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished. we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities. we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and, therefore, sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique. we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of significant quantities of asbestos.
income tax obligations liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of these potential liabilities. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
recent accounting pronouncements information on recently adopted and issued accounting standards is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates and assumptions. we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following:
•accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities
•pension and other post-retirement benefits plans
•business acquisitions, valuation and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
•income taxes management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board. while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. other significant accounting policies are outlined in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities we promote our products with advertising, trade promotions and consumer incentives. these programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives. we expense advertising costs and other direct marketing expenses as incurred. we recognize the costs of trade promotion and consumer incentive activities as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition. these estimates are based on our analysis of the programs offered, historical trends, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, sales and payment trends and our experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past. the estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in future periods due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation, particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products. differences between estimated expense and actual program performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period and are normally not significant. during 2023, 2022, and 2021, actual annual promotional costs have not deviated from the estimated amount by more than 3%. our trade promotion and consumer incentive accrued liabilities totaled $194.0 million and $215.7 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
pension and other post-retirement benefits plans we sponsor various defined benefit pension plans. the primary plans were the hershey company retirement plan ("retirement plan") and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees ("hourly plan"). these are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most u.s. employees hired prior to january 1, 2007. effective december 31, 2023, the hourly plan merged into the retirement plan and the name was changed to the hershey retirement plan for salaried and hourly employees. we also sponsor two primary other post-employment benefit ("opeb") plans, consisting of a health care plan and life insurance plan for retirees. the health care plan is contributory, with participants' contributions adjusted annually, and the life insurance plan is non-contributory.
for accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. our related accounting policies, accounting balances and plan assumptions are discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
pension plans changes in certain assumptions could significantly affect pension expense and benefit obligations, particularly the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate such obligations:
•long-term rate of return on plan assets. the expected long-term rate of return is evaluated on an annual basis. we consider a number of factors when setting assumptions with respect to the long-term rate of return, including current and expected asset allocation and historical and expected returns on the plan asset categories. actual asset the hershey company | 2023 form 10-k | page 40
allocations are regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate. investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return estimated using the long-term rate of return and the actual return realized. for 2023, we increased the expected return on plan assets assumption to 6.7% from the 6.3% assumption used during 2022. the historical average return (compounded annually) over the 20 years prior to december 31, 2023 was approximately 6.7%.
as of december 31, 2023, our plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately $181 million. we amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor amount, which is the greater of 10% of a respective plan's projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of plan assets. these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the expected long-term rate of investment returns, (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or (iii) other actuarial gains when actual plan experience is favorable as compared to the assumed experience. a 100 basis point decrease or increase in the long-term rate of return on pension assets would correspondingly increase or decrease annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately $7 million.
•discount rate. we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates along the yield curve. this approach does not affect the measurement of our pension and other post-retirement benefit liabilities but generally results in lower benefit expense in periods when the yield curve is upward sloping.
a 100 basis point decrease (increase) in the weighted-average pension discount rate would increase (decrease) annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately $5 million and the december 31, 2023 pension liability would increase by approximately $57 million or decrease by approximately $49 million, respectively.
pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is expected to be approximately $13 million in 2024. pension expense beyond 2024 will depend on future investment performance, our contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans.
other post-employment benefit plans changes in significant assumptions could affect consolidated expense and benefit obligations, particularly the discount rates used to calculate such obligations:
•discount rate. the determination of the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligations of the opeb plans is discussed in the pension plans section above. a 100 basis point decrease (increase) in the discount rate assumption for these plans would not be material to the opeb plans' consolidated expense and the december 31, 2023 benefit liability would increase by approximately $9 million or decrease by approximately $8 million, respectively.
business acquisitions, valuation and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets we use the acquisition method of accounting for business acquisitions. under the acquisition method, the results of operations of the acquired business have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the respective dates of the acquisitions. the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired, particularly intangible assets. as a result, we normally obtain the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets. the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. while management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
the hershey company | 2023 form 10-k | page 41
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead, are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present. our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
we test goodwill for impairment by performing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors in assessing the fair value of the related reporting unit. if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. otherwise, no further testing is required. for those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is indicated, requiring recognition of a goodwill impairment charge for the differential (up to the carrying value of goodwill). we test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair values with the book values of each asset.
we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets using an income approach. under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value. our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance, current and anticipated market conditions and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and profitability, and cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending. additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates, estimated discount rates, which may be risk-adjusted for the operating market of the reporting unit, and estimated royalty rates that would be charged for comparable branded licenses. we believe such assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar valuation purposes. such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions.
we also have intangible assets, consisting primarily of certain trademarks, customer-related intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions, that are expected to have determinable useful lives. the costs of finite-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. our estimates of the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets consider judgments regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. we conduct impairment tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these finite-lived assets may not be recoverable. undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists. if an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on the estimated fair value of the assets.
results of impairment tests at december 31, 2023, the net book value of our goodwill totaled $2.7 billion. as it relates to our 2023 annual testing performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter, we tested all of our reporting units using a quantitative assessment. based on our testing, all of our reporting units had an excess fair value well over their respective carrying values. there were no other events or circumstances that would indicate that impairment may exist. we had no goodwill impairment charges in 2023, 2022 or 2021.
income taxes we base our deferred income taxes, accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income, statutory tax rates, the legal structure of our company, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. we file income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities; a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which we have unrecognized tax benefits, is audited and finally resolved. from time to time, these audits result in assessments of additional tax. we maintain reserves for such assessments.
we apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being ultimately the hershey company | 2023 form 10-k | page 42
realized upon settlement. future changes in judgments and estimates related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such change. while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most likely outcome. accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense. we adjust these unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established. settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash. favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. our valuation allowances are primarily related to u.s. capital loss carryforwards and various foreign jurisdictions' net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets for which we do not expect to realize a benefit. refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the purpose of this management's discussion and analysis ("md&a") is to facilitate an understanding of significant factors influencing the operating results, financial condition and cash flows of gartner, inc. additionally, the md&a conveys our expectations of the potential impact of known trends, events or uncertainties that may impact future results. you should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10-k. historical results and percentage relationships are not necessarily indicative of operating results for future periods. references to "gartner," the "company," "we," "our" and "us" in this md&a are to gartner, inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
this md&a provides an analysis of our consolidated financial results, segment results and cash flows for 2023 and 2022 under the headings "results of operations," "segment results" and "liquidity and capital resources." for a similar detailed discussion comparing 2022 and 2021, refer to those headings under item 7., "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022.
in addition to gaap results, we provide foreign currency neutral dollar amounts and percentages for our revenues, certain expenses, contract values and other metrics. these foreign currency neutral dollar amounts and percentages eliminate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations and thus provide a more accurate and meaningful trend in the underlying data being measured. we calculate foreign currency neutral dollar amounts by converting the underlying amounts in local currency for different periods into u.s. dollars by applying the same foreign exchange rates to all periods presented.
forward-looking statements in addition to historical information, this annual report on form 10-k contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended, and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions, projections or strategies regarding the future. in some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as "may," "will," "expect," "should," "could," "believe," "plan," "anticipate," "estimate," "predict," "potential," "continue" or other words of similar meaning.
we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. although we believe that the expectations reflected in any of our forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in any of our forward-looking statements. our future quarterly and annual revenues, operating income, results of operations and cash flows, as well as any forward-looking statement, are subject to change and to inherent risks and uncertainties, such as those disclosed or incorporated by reference in our filings with the securities and exchange commission. important factors that could cause our actual results, performance and achievements, or industry results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in our forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: the impact of general economic conditions, including inflation (and related monetary policy by governments in response to inflation), on economic activity and our operations; changes in macroeconomic and market conditions and market volatility, including interest rates and the effect on the credit markets and access to capital; the impact of global economic and geopolitical conditions, including inflation, and recession; our ability to carry out our strategic initiatives and manage associated costs; our ability to recover potential claims under our event cancellation insurance; the timing of conferences and meetings, in particular our gartner symposium/xpo series that normally occurs during the fourth quarter; our ability to achieve and effectively manage growth, including our ability to integrate our acquisitions and consummate and integrate future acquisitions; our ability to pay our debt obligations; our ability to maintain and expand our products and services; our ability to expand or retain our customer base; our ability to grow or sustain revenue from individual customers; our ability to attract and retain a professional staff of research analysts and consultants as well as experienced sales personnel upon whom we are dependent, especially in light of labor competition; our ability to achieve continued customer renewals and achieve new contract value, backlog and deferred revenue growth in light of competitive pressures; our ability to successfully compete with existing competitors and potential new competitors; our ability to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights; our ability to keep pace with technological developments in artificial intelligence; additional risks associated with international operations, including foreign currency fluctuations; the impact on our business resulting from changes in international conditions, including those resulting from the conflict in the middle east, the war in ukraine and current and future sanctions imposed by governments or other authorities; the impact of restructuring and other charges on our businesses and operations; cybersecurity incidents; risks associated with the creditworthiness, budget cuts, and shutdown of governments and agencies; our ability to meet esg commitments; the impact of changes in tax policy (including global minimum tax legislation) and heightened scrutiny from various taxing authorities globally; changes to laws and regulations; and other risks and uncertainties. the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results. a description of the risk factors associated with our business is included under "risk factors" in item 1a. of this annual report on form 10-k, which is incorporated herein by reference.
forward-looking statements are subject to risks, estimates and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, those listed above or described under "risk factors" in item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k. in addition, historical, current and forward-looking sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management's opinion only as of the date on which they were made. forward-looking statements in this annual report on form 10-k speak only as of the date hereof, and forward-looking statements in documents attached that are incorporated by reference speak only as of the date of those documents. except as required by law, we disclaim any obligation to review or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances as they occur.

recent event in february 2023, we completed the sale of a non-core business, talentneuron, for approximately $161.1 million after considerations of post-close adjustments. talentneuron was included in the company's research segment. $161.1 million cash was received from the sale during the year ended december 31, 2023. we recognized a pre-tax gain of $135.4 million on the sale of talentneuron, which is included in gain from sale of divested operation in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2023.
business measurements we believe that the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments:
business segment        business measurement research                contract value represents the dollar value attributable to all of our subscription-related contracts. it is calculated as the annualized value of all contracts in effect at a specific point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract. contract value primarily includes research deliverables for which revenue is recognized on a ratable basis, as well as other deliverables (primarily conferences tickets) for which revenue is recognized when the deliverable is utilized. comparing contract value year-over-year not only measures the short-term growth of our business, but also signals the long-term health of our research subscription business since it measures revenue that is highly likely to recur over a multi-year period. our contract value consists of global technology sales contract value, which includes sales to users and providers of technology, and global business sales contract value, which includes sales to all other functional leaders.
client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time. client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients, who were also clients a year ago, by all clients from a year ago. client retention is calculated at an enterprise level, which represents a single company or customer.
wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a twelve-month period. wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of our current clients, who were also clients a year ago, by the contract value from a year ago, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. when wallet retention exceeds client retention, it is an indication of retention of higher-spending clients, or increased spending by retained clients, or both. wallet retention is calculated at an enterprise level, which represents a single company or customer.
consulting              consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from in-process consulting and benchmark analytics engagements.
utilization rate represents a measure of productivity of our consultants. utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill.
executive summary of operations and financial position the fundamentals of our strategy include a focus on creating actionable insights for executive leaders and their teams, delivering innovative and highly differentiated product offerings, building a strong sales capability, providing world class client service with a focus on client engagement and retention, and continuously improving our operational effectiveness.

research revenues increased to $4.9 billion in 2023, an increase of 6% compared to 2022 on both a reported basis and excluding the foreign currency impact. the research gross contribution margin was 74% in both 2023 and 2022. contract value was $4.8 billion at december 31, 2023, an increase of 8% compared to december 31, 2022 on a foreign currency neutral basis.
conferences revenues increased to $505.2 million in 2023, an increase of 30% compared to 2022 on a reported basis and 29% excluding the foreign currency impact. the conferences gross contribution margin was 50% and 54% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. we held 47 in-person conferences in 2023, and 25 in-person and 16 virtual conferences in 2022.
consulting revenues increased to $514.7 million in 2023, an increase of 7% compared to 2022 on a reported basis and 8% excluding the foreign currency impact. the consulting gross contribution margin was 35% and 39% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. backlog was $162.1 million at december 31, 2023.
cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion during 2023 and 2022, respectively. as of december 31, 2023, we had $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $1.0 billion of available borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility. during 2023, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of the company's common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $0.6 billion.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates. our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 - business and significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements. management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates. specific risks for these critical accounting policies are also described below.
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events. we develop our estimates using both current and historical experience, as well as other factors, including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future. we adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. however, our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision. in addition, these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and, as such, they may ultimately differ materially from actual results. ongoing changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the company's consolidated financial statements in future periods.
our critical accounting policies and estimates are described below.
revenue recognition - our revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows:
•research revenues are mainly derived from subscription contracts for research products. the related revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term. fees derived from assisting organizations in selecting the right business software for their needs are recognized when the leads are provided to vendors.
•consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee or time and materials engagements. revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized as we work to satisfy our performance obligations. revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided. revenues related to contract optimization engagements are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their payment.
the majority of our research contracts are billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. research contracts are generally non-cancelable and non-refundable, except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses. it is our policy to record the amount of a subscription contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue because the contract represents a legally enforceable claim.
note 1 - business and significant accounting policies and note 9 - revenue and related matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements provide additional information regarding our revenues.
accounting for income taxes - we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. this process involves estimating our current tax expense or benefit together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. in making this assessment, we consider the availability of loss carryforwards, projected reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. recognized tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit with greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized. we use estimates in determining the amount of unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions. significant judgment is required in evaluating tax law and measuring the benefits likely to be realized. uncertain tax positions are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information about their ultimate realization becomes available.
accounting for stock-based compensation - we account for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with fasb asc topics 505 and 718 and sec staff accounting bulletins no. 107 and no. 110. we recognize stock-based compensation expense, which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, over the related service period. note 10 - stock-based compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding stock-based compensation. determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based compensation awards requires the use of certain subjective assumptions, including the expected life of a stock-based compensation award and our common stock price volatility. in addition, determining the appropriate periodic stock-based compensation expense requires management to estimate the likelihood of the achievement of certain performance targets. the assumptions used in calculating the fair values of stock-based compensation awards and the related periodic expense represent management's best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. as a result, if circumstances change and we deem it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions we made or to use different assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of our stock-based compensation awards changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock-based compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period.
a change in any of the terms or conditions of stock-based compensation awards is accounted for as a modification of the award. incremental compensation cost is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before its terms are modified, measured based on the fair value of the awards at the modification date. for vested awards, we recognize incremental compensation cost in the period the modification occurs. for unvested awards, we recognize any incremental compensation expense at the modification date or ratably over the requisite remaining service period, as appropriate. if the fair value of the modified award is lower than the fair value of the original award immediately before modification, the minimum compensation cost we recognize is the cost of the original award.

refer to the section of this md&a below entitled "segment results" for a discussion of revenues and results by segment.
cost of services and product development was $1.9 billion in 2023, an increase of $209.5 million compared to 2022, or 12% on both a reported basis and excluding the foreign currency impact. the increase in cost of services and product development was primarily due to increased compensation costs as a result of higher headcount, as well as increased conference related expenses, due to the return to in-person destination conferences, partially offset by decreased research program expenses. cost of services and product development as a percent of revenues was 32% and 31% for 2023 and 2022, respectively.
selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expense was $2.7 billion in 2023, an increase of $220.6 million compared to 2022, or 9% on both a reported basis and excluding the foreign currency impact. the increase in sg&a during the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to the prior fiscal year, was primarily due to higher personnel costs in the current year, including higher salary expense due to increased headcount. these increases were partially offset by a reduction in facilities expense, related to a reduction of our real estate footprint. we expect to continue to evaluate our real estate footprint globally. if we determine there is any additional excess property, there is no assurance that we will be able to sublease any such excess properties or that we will not incur costs in connection with such exit activities, which may be material. during 2023, we incurred charges associated with the impairment of right-of-use assets and other long-lived assets, related to certain office locations we no longer intend to use, of $20.4 million, compared to $54.0 million in 2022.
the number of quota-bearing sales associates in global technology sales increased slightly to 3,641 and in global business sales increased by 8% to 1,188, compared to december 31, 2022. on a combined basis, the total number of quota-bearing sales associates increased by 2% when compared to december 31, 2022. sg&a expense as a percent of revenues was 46% and 45% during 2023 and 2022, respectively.
depreciation increased by 6% during 2023 compared to 2022. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2023 was primarily due to increased computer equipment and software additions in 2022 and 2023, partially offset by a reduction in leasehold improvements depreciation as a result of the impairment losses recorded during 2022 and 2023.
amortization of intangibles decreased by 6% during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to intangible assets divested as part of the sale of our talentneuron business.
acquisition and integration charges increased by $0.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022.
gain from sale of divested operation was attributable to the sale of our talentneuron business in february 2023. we recognized a pre-tax gain of $135.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2023.
operating income was $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion during 2023 and 2022, respectively. the increase in operating income was primarily due to the gain from sale of divested operation, as well as increased revenue, partially offset by an increase in cost of services and product development and selling, general and administrative expenses.
interest expense, net decreased by $27.1 million during 2023 compared to 2022. the decrease in interest expense, net was primarily due to increased interest income, as well as lower interest expense due to the maturation of $700.0 million in fixed-for-floating interest rate swap contracts in march 2022, partially offset by higher interest expense on our term loan.
other income, net for the years presented herein included the net impact of foreign currency gains and losses from our hedging activities, as well as sales of certain state tax credits and the recognition of other tax incentives. during 2023 and 2022, other income, net included a $3.9 million and a $52.3 million gain on de-designated interest rate swaps, respectively.
provision for income taxes was $264.7 million and $219.4 million during 2023 and 2022, respectively, with an effective income tax rate of 23.1% and 21.4% for 2023 and 2022, respectively. the increase in the effective income tax rate in 2023 was primarily the result of changes in unrecognized tax benefits year over year. note 12 - income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding the company's income taxes.
net income was $882.5 million and $807.8 million during 2023 and 2022, respectively. additionally, our diluted net income per share increased by $1.12 in 2023 compared to 2022. the increase in net income during 2023 was primarily the result of the gain from sale of divested operations, as well as increased revenue and interest income, partially offset by increased operating expenses, a lower gain from de-designated interest rate swaps and higher income tax expense.
segment results we evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. gross contribution is defined as operating income or loss excluding certain cost of services and product development expenses, sg&a expenses, depreciation, amortization of intangibles, and acquisition and integration charges. gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percent of revenues.

research revenues increased by $282.3 million during 2023 compared to 2022, or 6% on both a reported basis and excluding the foreign currency impact. the increase in revenues during 2023 was primarily due to strong research contract value growth in 2022. the gross contribution margin was 74% in both 2023 and 2022, as the increase in revenue and decreased research program expenses were offset by an increase in personnel expenses to support future growth.
contract value increased to $4.8 billion at december 31, 2023, or 8% compared to december 31, 2022 on a foreign currency neutral basis. all industry sectors grew at least high single-digit rates, other than technology and media. the fastest growth was in the public, energy and manufacturing sectors. global technology sales ("gts") contract value increased by 6% at december 31, 2023 when compared to december 31, 2022. the increase in gts contract value was primarily due to new business from existing clients. gts contract value increased by at least mid single-digits for the majority of enterprise sizes and sectors. global business sales ("gbs") contract value increased by 13% year-over-year, also primarily driven by new business from existing clients. the majority of our gbs practices achieved double-digit growth rates, with the majority of enterprise sizes and sectors also growing double-digits year-over-year.

(2)backlog is on a foreign currency neutral basis. backlog as of december 31, 2022 has been calculated using the same foreign currency rates as 2023.
consulting revenues increased 7% during 2023 compared to 2022 on a reported basis and 8% excluding the foreign currency impact. the increase in revenues on a reported basis was due to a 6% increase in labor-based consulting, and a 10% increase in contract optimization. contract optimization revenue may vary significantly and, as such, 2023 revenues may not be indicative of future results. the segment gross contribution margin was 35% and 39% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the decrease in gross contribution margin during 2023 was primarily due to increased personnel expense related to higher headcount, partially offset by the increase in revenue.
liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations through cash generated from our operating activities and borrowings. note 6 - debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding the company's outstanding debt obligations. at december 31, 2023, we had $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $1.0 billion of available borrowing capacity on the revolving credit facility under our 2020 credit agreement. we believe that the company has adequate liquidity and access to capital markets to meet its currently anticipated needs for both the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.
we have historically generated significant cash flows from our operating activities, benefiting from the favorable working capital dynamics of our subscription-based business model in our research segment, which is our largest business segment and historically has constituted a significant portion of our total revenues. the majority of our research customer contracts are paid in advance and, combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins, our subscription-based business model has resulted in continuously strong operating cash flow. cash flow generation has also benefited from our ongoing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as a focus on the optimal management of our working capital as we increase sales.
our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world with 55% held overseas at december 31, 2023. the company intends to reinvest substantially all of its accumulated undistributed foreign earnings, except in instances where repatriation would result in minimal additional tax.

non-gaap financial measures the discussions in "overview and outlook," "results of operations," and "liquidity and capital resources" below include references to financial measures that are not defined under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). these non-gaap financial measures include adjusted operating income (including adjusted operating income for each of our reportable segments, as applicable); refining, renewable diesel, and ethanol segment margin; and capital investments attributable to valero. we have included these non-gaap financial measures to help facilitate the comparison of operating results between years, to help assess our cash flows, and because we believe they provide useful information as discussed further below. see the tables in note (h) beginning on page 54 for reconciliations of adjusted operating income (including adjusted operating income for each of our reportable segments, as applicable) and refining, renewable diesel, and ethanol segment margin to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures. also in note (h), we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of such non-gaap financial measures provides useful information. see the table on page 61 for a reconciliation of capital investments attributable to valero to its most directly comparable gaap financial measure. also on page 61, we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of this non-gaap financial measure provides useful information.
overview and outlook overview business operations update our results for the year ended december 31, 2023 were favorably impacted by the continued strong worldwide demand for petroleum-based transportation fuels, while the worldwide supply of those products remained constrained. this global supply and demand imbalance contributed to strong refining margins for 2023.
the strong demand for our products and continued strength in refining margins were the primary contributors to us reporting $8.8 billion of net income attributable to valero stockholders for the year ended december 31, 2023. our operating results for 2023, including operating results by segment, are described in the summary on the following page, and detailed descriptions can be found below under "results of operations" beginning on page 46.
our operations generated $9.2 billion of cash in 2023. this cash was used to make $1.9 billion of capital investments in our business and return $6.6 billion to our stockholders through purchases of common stock for treasury and dividend payments. in addition, we reduced our outstanding debt through the purchase of $199 million of our public debt in 2023. as a result of this and other activity, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $562 million during 2023 to $5.4 billion as of december 31, 2023. we had $10.5 billion in liquidity as of december 31, 2023. the components of our liquidity and descriptions of our cash flows, capital investments, and other matters impacting our liquidity and capital resources can be found below under "liquidity and capital resources" beginning on page 57.
results for the year ended december 31, 2023
for 2023, we reported net income attributable to valero stockholders of $8.8 billion compared to $11.5 billion for 2022. the decrease of $2.7 billion was primarily due to a decrease in operating income of $3.8 billion, partially offset by an increase in "other income, net" of $323 million and a decrease in income tax expense of $809 million. the details of our operating income and adjusted operating income by segment, where applicable, and in total are reflected in the following table (in millions). adjusted operating income excludes the adjustments reflected in the tables in note (h) beginning on page 54.
2023                        2022                         change refining segment:
•renewable diesel segment. renewable diesel segment operating income increased by $78 million primarily due to lower feedstock costs and higher sales volumes, partially offset by lower product prices (primarily renewable diesel), higher operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), and higher depreciation and amortization expense.
outlook many uncertainties remain with respect to the supply and demand imbalance in the petroleum-based products market worldwide. while it is difficult to predict future worldwide economic activity and its impact on product supply and demand, as well as any effect that the uncertainty described in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements or other political or regulatory developments may have on us, we have noted several factors below that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the first quarter of 2024.
•combined light product (gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel) inventories in the u.s. and europe remain below historical levels reflecting tight global petroleum product balances, which should support continued high utilization of refining capacity.
•crude oil discounts have widened, consistent with typical seasonal patterns and expected industry-wide refinery maintenance activity in the first quarter of 2024; however, continued sour crude oil production cuts by opec+ suppliers and the pending start-up of the trans mountain pipeline expansion may dampen some of the seasonal effect. in addition, conflict in the middle east, including impacts on shipping routes and freight costs, could result in increased volatility in the crude oil market and potentially impact crude oil discounts.
•renewable diesel demand is expected to remain consistent with current levels.
results of operations the following tables, including the reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures in note (h) beginning on page 54, highlight our results of operations, our operating performance, and market reference prices that directly impact our operations. note references in this section can be found on pages 53 through 56.

ethanol segment margin is primarily affected by prices for the ethanol and corn related co-products that we sell and the cost of corn that we process. the table on page 49 reflects market reference prices that we believe impacted our ethanol segment margin in 2023 compared to 2022.
◦lower prices for the corn related co-products that we produce, primarily ddgs and inedible distillers corn oils, had an unfavorable impact of approximately $129 million.
•ethanol segment operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) decreased by $110 million primarily due to lower natural gas costs.
(a)under the rfs program, the epa is required to set annual quotas for the volume of renewable fuels that obligated parties, such as us, must blend into petroleum-based transportation fuels consumed in the u.s. the quotas are used to determine an obligated party's rvo. the epa released a final rule on june 3, 2022 that, among other things, modified the volume standards for 2020 and, for the first time, established volume standards for 2021 and 2022.
in 2020, we recognized the cost of the rvo using the 2020 quotas set by the epa at that time, and in 2021 and the three months ended march 31, 2022, we recognized the cost of the rvo using our estimates of the quotas. as a result of the final rule released by the epa as noted above, we recognized a benefit of $104 million in the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily related to the modification of the 2020 quotas.
(b)depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december 31, 2022 includes a gain of $23 million on the sale of our ethanol plant located in jefferson, wisconsin (jefferson ethanol plant).
(c)our ethanol plant located in lakota, iowa (lakota ethanol plant) was previously configured to produce usp-grade ethanol, a higher grade ethanol suitable for hand sanitizer blending that has a higher market value than fuel-grade ethanol. during 2022, demand for usp-grade ethanol declined and had a negative impact on the profitability of the plant. as a result, we tested the recoverability of the carrying value of the lakota ethanol plant and concluded that it was impaired. therefore, we reduced the carrying value of the plant to its estimated fair value and recognized an asset impairment loss of $61 million in the year ended december 31, 2022.
(d)general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) for the year ended december 31, 2022 includes a charge of $20 million for an environmental reserve adjustment associated with a non-operating site.
◦a pension settlement charge of $58 million in the year ended december 31, 2022 resulting from a greater number of employees that retired in 2022 who elected lump sum benefit payments from our defined benefit pension plans than estimated.
(f)income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2022 includes deferred income tax expense of $51 million associated with the recognition of a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding tax on the repatriation of cash held by one of our international subsidiaries that we considered no longer permanently reinvested in our operations in that country.
(g)the rvo cost represents the average market cost on a per barrel basis to comply with the rfs program. the rvo cost is calculated by multiplying (i) the average market price during the applicable period for the rins associated with each class of renewable fuel (i.e., biomass-based diesel, cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel) by (ii) the quotas for the volume of each class of renewable fuel that must be blended into petroleum-based transportation fuels consumed in the u.s., as set or proposed by the epa, on a percentage basis for each class of renewable fuel and adding together the results of each calculation.
(h)we use certain financial measures (as noted below) that are not defined under gaap and are considered to be non-gaap financial measures.
we have defined these non-gaap measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements, including industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. we believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable gaap measures, they provide improved comparability between periods after adjusting for certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. these non-gaap measures should not be considered as alternatives to their most comparable gaap measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under gaap. in addition, these non-gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently, which diminishes their utility.
non-gaap financial measures are as follows (in millions):
•adjusted operating income is defined as total company operating income excluding the modification of rvo adjustment, the gain on sale of ethanol plant, the asset impairment loss, the environmental reserve adjustment, and other operating expenses, as reflected in the table below.
environmental reserve adjustment (see note (d))                                                      -                              20
(i)we use throughput volumes, sales volumes, and production volumes for the refining segment, renewable diesel segment, and ethanol segment, respectively, due to their general use by others who operate facilities similar to those included in our segments.
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity our liquidity consisted of the following as of december 31, 2023 (in millions):
available capacity from our committed facilities (a):
accounts receivable sales facility                              1,300
total available capacity                                        5,296
total liquidity                                               $10,460
(a)excludes the committed facilities of the consolidated vies.
(b)excludes $260 million of cash and cash equivalents related to the consolidated vies that is for their use only.
information about our outstanding borrowings, letters of credit issued, and availability under our credit facilities is reflected in note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. however, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements may increase. as of december 31, 2023, all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt, including debt guaranteed by us, were at or above investment grade level as follows:
rating agency                                rating moody's investors service                    baa2 (stable outlook)
fitch ratings                                bbb (stable outlook)
we cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings.
we believe we have sufficient funds from operations and from available capacity under our credit facilities to fund our ongoing operating requirements and other commitments over the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. we expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional cash through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. however, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.

cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2023
in 2023, we used the $9.2 billion of cash generated by our operations and the $2.4 billion in debt borrowings to make $1.9 billion of investments in our business, repay $2.7 billion of debt and finance lease obligations (including premiums paid on the early retirement of debt), return $6.6 billion to our stockholders through purchases of our common stock for treasury and dividend payments, and increase our available cash on hand by $562 million. the debt borrowings and repayments are described in note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
as previously noted, our operations generated $9.2 billion of cash in 2023, driven primarily by net income of $9.1 billion and noncash charges to income of $2.4 billion, partially offset by an unfavorable change in working capital of $2.3 billion. noncash charges primarily included $2.7 billion of depreciation and amortization expense and $103 million of deferred income tax expense. details regarding the components of the change in working capital, along with the reasons for the changes in those components, are described in note 18 of notes to consolidated financial statements. in addition, see "results of operations" for an analysis of the significant components of our net income.
our investing activities primarily consisted of $1.9 billion in capital investments, as defined below under "capital investments," of which $294 million related to capital investments made by dgd.
cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2022
in 2022, we used the $12.6 billion of cash generated by our operations and the $3.2 billion from the debt issuance and borrowings to make $2.8 billion of investments in our business, repay $6.0 billion of debt and finance lease obligations (including premiums paid on the early retirement of debt), return $6.1 billion to our stockholders through purchases of our common stock for treasury and dividend payments, and increase our available cash on hand by $740 million. the debt issuance, borrowings, and repayments are described in note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
as previously noted, our operations generated $12.6 billion of cash in 2022, driven primarily by net income of $11.9 billion and noncash charges to income of $2.3 billion, partially offset by an unfavorable change in working capital of $1.6 billion. noncash charges primarily included $2.5 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, $50 million of deferred income tax expense, and a $61 million asset impairment loss associated with our lakota ethanol plant, as described in note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements. details regarding the components of the change in working capital, along with the reasons for the changes in those components, are described in note 18 of notes to consolidated financial statements. in addition, see "results of operations" for an analysis of the significant components of our net income.
our investing activities of $2.8 billion primarily consisted of $2.7 billion in capital investments, of which $879 million related to capital investments made by dgd.
our capital resources our material cash requirements as of december 31, 2023 primarily consist of working capital requirements, capital investments, contractual obligations, and other matters, as described below. our operations have historically generated positive cash flows to fulfill our working capital requirements and other uses of cash as discussed below.
capital investments capital investments are comprised of our capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures, and investments in nonconsolidated joint ventures, as reflected in our statements of cash flows as shown on page 76. capital investments exclude acquisitions, if any.
we also identify our capital investments by the nature of the project with which the expenditure is associated as follows:
•sustaining capital investments are generally associated with projects that are expected to extend the lives of our property assets, sustain their operating capabilities and safety (including deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures), or comply with regulatory requirements. regulatory compliance capital investments are generally associated with projects that are incurred to comply with government regulatory requirements, such as requirements to reduce emissions and prohibited elements from our products.
•growth capital investments, including low-carbon growth capital investments that support the development and growth of our low-carbon renewable diesel and ethanol businesses, are generally associated with projects for the construction of new property assets that are expected to enhance our profitability and cash-generating capabilities, including investments in nonconsolidated joint ventures.
we have developed an extensive multi-year capital investment program, which we update and revise based on changing internal and external factors. the following table reflects our expected capital investments for the year ending december 31, 2024 by nature of the project and reportable segment, along with historical amounts for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 (in millions). the following table also reflects capital investments attributable to valero, which is a non-gaap measure that we define and reconcile to capital investments below under "capital investments attributable to valero."

we have publicly announced ghg emissions reduction/displacement targets and a long-term ambition. we believe that our allocation of growth capital into low-carbon projects to date has been consistent with such targets and ambition. certain low-carbon projects have been completed or are already in execution and the associated capital investments are included in our expected capital investments for 2024. our capital investments in future years to achieve these targets and ambition are expected to include investments associated with certain low-carbon projects currently at various stages of progress, evaluation, or approval. see "items 1. and 2. business and properties-our comprehensive liquid fuels strategy-our low-carbon projects" for a description of our low-carbon projects.
capital investments attributable to valero capital investments attributable to valero is a non-gaap financial measure that reflects our net share of capital investments and is defined as all capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst cost expenditures, and investments in nonconsolidated joint ventures, excluding the portion of dgd's capital investments attributable to the other joint venture member and all of the capital expenditures of other consolidated vies.
we are a 50 percent joint venture member in dgd and consolidate its financial statements, and dgd's operations compose our renewable diesel segment. as a result, all of dgd's net cash provided by operating activities (or operating cash flow) is included in our consolidated net cash provided by operating activities. dgd's members use dgd's operating cash flow (excluding changes in its current assets and current liabilities) to fund its capital investments rather than distribute all of that cash to themselves. because dgd's operating cash flow is effectively attributable to each member, only 50 percent of dgd's capital investments should be attributed to our net share of capital investments. we also exclude all of the capital expenditures of other vies that we consolidate because we do not operate those vies. see note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information about the vies that we consolidate. we believe capital investments attributable to valero is an important measure because it more accurately reflects our capital investments.
capital investments attributable to valero should not be considered as an alternative to capital investments, which is the most comparable gaap measure, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our cash flows as reported under gaap. in addition, this non-gaap measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define it differently, which may diminish its utility.

(a)debt obligations and a maturity analysis of our debt are described in note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements. debt obligations exclude amounts related to net unamortized debt issuance costs and other.
(b)interest payments related to debt obligations are the expected payments based on information available as of december 31, 2023.
(c)operating lease liabilities, finance lease obligations, and maturity analyses of remaining minimum lease payments are described in note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements. operating lease liabilities and finance lease obligations reflected in this table include related interest expense.
(d)other long-term liabilities are described in note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements. other long-term liabilities exclude amounts related to the long-term portion of operating lease liabilities that are separately presented above.
(e)purchase obligations are described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements. purchase obligations are based on (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (ii) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions.
the amount outstanding associated with the ienova revolver, as defined and described in note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements, is reflected in current portion of debt and finance lease obligations in our balance sheet as of december 31, 2023, and also included in the table above in debt obligations - short-term. the ienova revolver is subject to repayment on demand; however, we do not expect the lender to demand repayment during the next 12 months. thus, the final cash flows for this instrument cannot be predicted with certainty at this time.
in 2023, we used cash on hand to purchase and retire $199 million of our public debt. we will continue to evaluate further deleveraging opportunities.
we previously announced our participation in navigator's proposed large-scale carbon capture and sequestration pipeline system in the mid-continent region of the u.s. in october 2023, navigator announced that it decided to cancel this project. under the terms of agreements associated with the project, we may have some rights from and obligations to navigator, including a portion of the aggregate project costs to date, but we do not expect such obligation will be material.
we have not entered into any transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.
other matters impacting liquidity and capital resources stock purchase programs during the year ended december 31, 2023, we purchased for treasury 39,717,265 of our shares for a total cost of $5.2 billion. as of december 31, 2023, we had $2.2 billion remaining available for purchase under the september 2023 program. on february 22, 2024, our board authorized us to purchase shares of our outstanding common stock for a total cost of up to $2.5 billion with no expiration date, which is in addition to the amount remaining under the september 2023 program. we will continue to evaluate the timing of purchases when appropriate. we have no obligation to make purchases under these programs.
pension plan funding we plan to contribute $113 million to our pension plans and $22 million to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2024. see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our employee benefit plans.
cash held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2023, $4.3 billion of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. cash held by our foreign subsidiaries can be repatriated to us through dividends without any u.s. federal income tax consequences, but certain other taxes may apply, including, but not limited to, withholding taxes imposed by certain foreign jurisdictions, u.s. state income taxes, and u.s. federal income tax on foreign exchange gains. therefore, there is a cost to repatriate cash held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries to us.
environmental matters our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by government authorities relating to, among other matters, the discharge of materials into the environment, climate, waste management, pollution prevention measures, ghg and other emissions, our facilities and operations, and characteristics and composition of many of our products. because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future costs and expenditures required for environmental matters could increase. see note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosure of our environmental liabilities. in addition, see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements regarding our accounting for these liabilities under "environmental matters." see also "items 1. and 2. business and properties-government regulations" and the items incorporated by reference therein.
concentration of customers our operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined petroleum product wholesalers and retailers. these concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions, including the uncertainties concerning worldwide events causing volatility in the global crude oil markets. however, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable. see also "item 1a. risk factors-legal, government, and regulatory risks-we are subject to risks arising from legal, political, and regulatory developments regarding climate, ghg emissions, and the environment."
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ from those estimates. the following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. the following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations. we believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. unless otherwise noted, estimates of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions used in determining our estimates is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and contingencies involved, and the wide range of possible outcomes.
unrecognized tax benefits we take tax positions in our tax returns from time to time that ultimately may not be allowed by the relevant taxing authorities. when we take such positions, we evaluate the likelihood of sustaining those positions and determine the amount of tax benefit arising from such positions, if any, that should be recognized in our financial statements. tax benefits not recognized by us are recorded as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which represents our potential future obligation to various taxing authorities if the tax positions are not sustained.
the evaluation of tax positions and the determination of the benefit arising from such positions that are recognized in our financial statements requires us to make significant judgments and estimates based on an analysis of complex tax laws and regulations and related interpretations. these judgments and estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and changes in legislation.
details of our changes in unrecognized tax benefits, along with other information about our unrecognized tax benefits, are included in note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
impairment of long-lived assets long-lived assets (primarily property, plant, and equipment) are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. a long-lived asset is not recoverable if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. if a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value, with fair value determined based on discounted estimated net cash flows or other appropriate methods.
in order to test for recoverability, we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated. such estimates include, but are not limited to, assumptions about future sales volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, margins, the use or disposition of the asset, the asset's estimated remaining useful life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain the asset's existing service potential in light of existing and expected regulations. due to the significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability, changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future, thus affecting our earnings.
new environmental and tax laws and regulations, as well as changes to existing laws and regulations, are continuously being enacted or proposed. the implementation of future legislative and regulatory initiatives (such as those discussed in item 1a. risk factors) that may adversely affect our operations could indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and result in an impairment loss that could be material. if the circumstances that trigger an impairment also result in a reduction in the estimated useful life of the asset, then we may also be required to recognize an asset retirement obligation for that asset.

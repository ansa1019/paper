the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k income statement highlights net income for 2023 was $5.6 billion or $12.79 per diluted common share, a decrease of $0.5 billion, or 8%, compared to net income of $6.1 billion, or $13.85 per diluted common share, for 2022. the decrease was driven by higher expenses, which included the impact of the fdic special assessment and workforce reduction charges, as well as lower noninterest income and a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher net interest income.
•noninterest income decreased $0.5 billion, or 7%, to $7.6 billion, primarily due to lower capital markets and advisory income and a decline in private equity revenue. the decrease also included negative visa class b derivative fair value adjustments of $279 million for 2023 compared to $40 million of negative adjustments for 2022.
•provision for credit losses was $742 million in 2023, primarily driven by portfolio activity, including changes in credit quality related to the commercial real estate portfolio. provision for credit losses was $477 million in 2022.
for additional detail, see the consolidated income statement review section of this item 7.
balance sheet highlights our balance sheet was strong and well positioned at december 31, 2023. in comparison to december 31, 2022:
•total assets increased modestly due to higher balances held with the federal reserve bank, partially offset by lower securities and loan balances.
•total commercial loans decreased $5.5 billion, or 2%, to $219.6 billion, driven by lower utilization of loan commitments and paydowns outpacing new production, partially offset by the acquisition of capital commitment facilities from signature bridge bank, n.a. on october 2, 2023.
•total consumer loans increased $1.0 billion, to $102.0 billion, due to growth in residential mortgages, home equity, credit card and automobile loans, partially offset by declines in the remaining portfolios as paydowns outpaced new originations and draws on existing accounts.
•investment securities decreased $6.8 billion, or 5%, to $132.6 billion, as limited purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities.
•interest earning deposits with banks, primarily with the federal reserve bank, increased $16.5 billion, or 60%, to $43.8 billion, primarily due to higher borrowed funds and lower securities and loan balances, partially offset by lower deposits.
•total deposits decreased $14.9 billion, or 3%, to $421.4 billion, as a result of lower consumer and commercial deposits, reflecting the impact of competitive pricing dynamics and inflationary pressures.
for additional detail, see the consolidated balance sheet review section of this item 7.
credit quality highlights
2023 reflected strong credit quality performance.
•the acl related to loans, which consists of the alll and the allowance for unfunded lending related commitments, totaled $5.5 billion, or 1.70% of total loans at december 31, 2023, and was relatively stable in comparison to reserves at december 31, 2022. the slight increase in reserves was primarily driven by portfolio activity, including changes in credit quality related to the commercial real estate portfolio, partially offset by an updated economic outlook.
the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k for additional detail, see the credit risk management portion of the risk management section of this item 7.
capital and liquidity highlights we maintained strong capital and liquidity positions during 2023.
•common shareholders' equity increased $4.9 billion to $44.9 billion at december 31, 2023, due to the benefit of net income and an improvement in aoci, partially offset by common dividends paid and common share repurchases.
•in 2023, we returned $3.1 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends on common shares of $2.5 billion and repurchases of 4.0 million common shares for $0.6 billion.
•consistent with the scb framework, which allows for capital return in amounts in excess of the scb minimum levels, our board of directors has authorized a repurchase framework under the previously approved repurchase program of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 45% were still available for repurchase at december 31, 2023. in light of the federal banking agencies proposed rules to adjust the basel iii capital framework, share repurchase activity is expected to remain modest during the first quarter of 2024. pnc continues to evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rules and may adjust share repurchase activity depending on market and economic conditions, as well as other factors. pnc's scb for the four-quarter period beginning october 1, 2023 is the regulatory minimum of 2.5%.
•the basel iii cet1 capital ratio increased to 9.9% at december 31, 2023 from 9.1% at december 31, 2022.
•pnc elected a five-year transition provision effective march 31, 2020 to delay until december 31, 2021 the full impact of the cecl standard on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. effective for the first quarter of 2022, pnc is now in the three-year transition period, and the full impact of the cecl standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through december 31, 2024. the estimated fully implemented ratios reflect the full impact of cecl and exclude the benefits of this transition provision. the estimated cet1 fully implemented ratio was 9.8% at december 31, 2023 compared to 8.9% at december 31, 2022.
pnc's ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to pnc meeting or exceeding an scb established by the federal reserve board in connection with the federal reserve board's ccar process. see additional discussion of the ccar process in the supervision and regulation section of item 1 business and item 1a risk factors of this report.
see the liquidity and capital management portion of the risk management section of this item 7 for more detail on our 2023 capital and liquidity actions as well as our capital ratios.
business outlook statements regarding our business outlook are forward-looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. our forward-looking financial statements are subject, among other things, to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies. these statements are based on our views that:
•pnc expects the federal funds rate to remain unchanged in the first part of 2024, between 5.25% and 5.50%, with federal funds rate cuts starting in may 2024 as inflation slows further. pnc expects the federal funds rate to end 2024 between 4.25% and 4.50%.
see item 1a risk factors and the cautionary statement regarding forward-looking information section in this item 7 for other factors that could cause future events to differ, perhaps materially, from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
•noninterest income, excluding net securities gains and visa activity, to be up 4% to 6%,
•other noninterest income, excluding net securities gains and visa activity, to be between $150 million and $200 million,
core noninterest expense guidance excludes the $515 million pre-tax impact of the fdic's special assessment related to the closures of silicon valley bank and signature bank as well as $150 million of pre-tax workforce reduction charges incurred in the fourth quarter of 2023. see the statistical information (unaudited) - reconciliation of core noninterest expense guidance (non-gaap) section of this report.
we are unable to provide a meaningful or accurate reconciliation of forward-looking non-gaap measures, without unreasonable effort, to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures except for the impact of charges related to the fdic special assessment and the workforce reduction to noninterest expense. this is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and amounts necessary for the reconciliation when such amounts are subject to events that cannot be reasonably predicted, as noted in our cautionary statement. accordingly, we cannot address the probable significance of unavailable information.
consolidated income statement review our consolidated income statement is presented in item 8 of this report. for the comparison of 2022 over 2021, see the consolidated income statement review section in our 2022 form 10-k.
net income for 2023 was $5.6 billion, or $12.79 per diluted common share, a decrease of $0.5 billion, or 8%, compared to net income of $6.1 billion, or $13.85 per diluted common share, for 2022. the decrease was driven by higher expenses, which included the impact of the fdic special assessment and workforce reduction charges, as well as lower noninterest income and a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher net interest income.

(a)interest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. to provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. this adjustment is not permitted under gaap on the consolidated income statement. for more information, see reconciliation of taxable-equivalent net interest income (non-gaap) in the statistical information (unaudited) section in item 8 of this report.
the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. see the statistical information (unaudited) - average consolidated balance sheet and net interest analysis and analysis of year-to-year changes in net interest income in item 8 of this report for additional information.
net interest income increased $0.9 billion, or 7% in 2023 compared with 2022. the increase was due to higher interest-earning asset yields and balances, partially offset by higher funding costs. net interest margin increased 11 basis points, reflecting higher yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by increased funding costs.
average investment securities increased $3.2 billion, or 2%, primarily reflecting an increase in agency residential mortgage-backed securities. average investment securities represented 28% of average interest-earning assets in both 2023 and 2022.
average interest-earning deposits with banks decreased $4.4 billion, or 11%, primarily due to lower deposits and higher loan balances, partially offset by higher borrowed funds.
average interest-bearing deposits increased $16.4 billion, or 5%, reflecting a continued shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits as deposit rates have risen. in total, average interest-bearing deposits represented 82% of average interest-bearing liabilities in 2023 compared to 88% in 2022.

asset management and brokerage fees decreased reflecting lower client activity. pnc's discretionary client assets under management increased to $189 billion at december 31, 2023, compared to $173 billion at december 31, 2022, driven by higher spot equity markets, partially offset by client activity.
capital markets and advisory fees decreased primarily due to lower merger and acquisition advisory fees and trading revenue.
lending and deposit services grew reflecting increased customer activity and growth in loan commitment fees.
residential and commercial mortgage decreased primarily due to lower commercial mortgage banking activities, partially offset by an increase in residential mortgage servicing fees.
other noninterest income decreased compared to 2022, primarily due to lower private equity revenue and the impact of visa class b derivative fair value adjustments of negative $279 million primarily related to the extension of anticipated litigation resolution timing. visa class b derivative fair value adjustments were negative $40 million in 2022.

effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate was 16.2% for 2023 compared with 18.2% for 2022. the decrease was due to the favorable impact of certain tax matters in 2023.
the effective tax rate is generally lower than the statutory rate primarily due to tax credits we receive from our investments in low- income housing and new markets investments, as well as earnings on other tax exempt investments. additional information regarding our effective tax rate is included in the reconciliation of statutory and effective tax rates table in note 18 income taxes.

our balance sheet was strong and well-positioned at december 31, 2023. in comparison to december 31, 2022:
•total assets increased modestly due to higher balances held with the federal reserve bank, partially offset by lower securities and loan balances.
•total liabilities were largely stable and included lower deposits, mostly offset by higher borrowed funds.
•total equity increased due to the benefit of net income, an improvement in aoci and net preferred stock issuances, partially offset by dividends paid and common share repurchases.
the acl related to loans totaled $5.5 billion at december 31, 2023, and was relatively stable in comparison to reserves at december 31, 2022. the slight increase in reserves was primarily driven by portfolio activity, including changes in credit quality related to the commercial real estate portfolio, partially offset by an updated economic outlook. see the following for additional information regarding our acl related to loans:

commercial loans decreased driven by lower utilization of loan commitments and paydowns outpacing new production, partially offset by the acquisition of capital commitment facilities from signature bridge bank, n.a. on october 2, 2023.
consumer loans increased due to growth in residential mortgages, home equity, credit card and automobile loans, partially offset by declines in the remaining portfolios as paydowns outpaced new originations and draws on existing accounts.
for additional information regarding our loan portfolio, see the credit risk management portion of the risk management section, note 1 accounting policies and note 3 loans and related allowance for credit losses.
investment securities investment securities of $132.6 billion at december 31, 2023 decreased $6.8 billion, or 5%, compared to december 31, 2022, as limited purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities.
the level and composition of the investment securities portfolio fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, loan and deposit growth, and balance sheet management activities. we manage our investment securities portfolio to optimize returns, while providing a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering the lcr, nsfr and other internal and external guidelines and constraints.

(a)of our total securities portfolio, 97% were rated aaa/aa at both december 31, 2023 and 2022.
(b)amortized cost is presented net of the allowance for investment securities, which totaled $92 million at december 31, 2023 and primarily related to non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. the comparable amount at december 31, 2022 was $149 million.
(d)collateralized primarily by consumer credit products, corporate debt and government guaranteed education loans.
(e)includes state and municipal securities and corporate bonds.
(f)includes available for sale and held to maturity securities, which are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value and amortized cost, respectively.
the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k table 9 presents our investment securities portfolio by amortized cost and fair value. the relationship of fair value to amortized cost at december 31, 2023 was comparable to december 31, 2022 and primarily reflected the impact of higher interest rates on the valuation of fixed-rate securities. we continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and maintain the allowance for investment securities at an appropriate level to absorb expected credit losses on our investment securities portfolio for the remaining contractual term of the securities adjusted for expected prepayments. see note 2 investment securities for additional details regarding the allowance for investment securities.
the duration of investment securities was 4.2 years at december 31, 2023. we estimate that at december 31, 2023 the effective duration of investment securities was 4.1 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 4.2 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. comparable amounts at december 31, 2022 for the effective duration of investment securities were 4.4 years and 4.5 years, respectively.
based on expected prepayment speeds, the weighted-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio was 5.5 years at december 31, 2023 compared to 6.0 years at december 31, 2022.

deposits are considered an attractive source of funding due to their stability and relatively low cost to fund. compared to december 31, 2022, our funding source composition has shifted and now includes lower deposit balances and higher borrowed funds, contributing to higher funding costs.
total deposits decreased as a result of lower consumer and commercial deposits, reflecting the impact of competitive pricing dynamics and inflationary pressures. in addition, noninterest-bearing balances decreased due to the continued shift into interest-bearing deposits as a result of the elevated interest rate environment. a portion of that shift included an increase in total brokered deposits compared with 2022. our total brokered deposit balances of $11.0 billion in 2023 and $9.5 billion in 2022, were significantly below both our internal and regulatory guidelines and limits.
the level and composition of borrowed funds fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, capital considerations, and funding needs, which are primarily driven by changes in loan, deposit and investment securities balances. while our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses, we also manage our borrowed funds to provide a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering our lcr and nsfr requirements and other internal and external guidelines and constraints. see the liquidity and capital management portion of the risk management section of this item 7 for additional information regarding our 2023 liquidity and capital activities. see note 9 borrowed funds for additional information related to our borrowings. see average consolidated balance sheet and net interest analysis and analysis of year-to-year changes in net interest income in the statistical information section of this report for additional information on year-over-year volume and related funding cost changes.
shareholders' equity total shareholders' equity was $51.1 billion at december 31, 2023, an increase of $5.3 billion compared to december 31, 2022, as increases related to net income of $5.6 billion, an improvement in aoci of $2.5 billion and net preferred stock issuances of $0.5 billion were partially offset by dividends paid of $2.8 billion and common share repurchases of $0.6 billion.

retail banking earnings increased $1.8 billion in 2023 compared with 2022, primarily due to increased net interest income, partially offset by an increased provision for credit losses.
net interest income increased in the comparison due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of loans.
noninterest income decreased primarily due to the impact of negative visa class b derivative fair value adjustments compared to 2022, partially offset by growth in residential mortgage banking and lending and deposit customer-related activities.
provision for credit losses was primarily driven by portfolio activity.
the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k retail banking average total loans increased in 2023 compared to 2022. average consumer loans increased driven by higher residential real estate and home equity loans as a result of new volume and draws on existing accounts outpacing liquidations, as well as growth in credit card loans due to new account production and purchase volume increases. the increase was partially offset by declines across the remaining portfolio as paydowns outpaced new originations. average commercial loans increased due to growth in automobile dealer segment balances, partially offset by forgiveness of ppp loans.
our focus on growing primary customer relationships is at the core of our deposit strategy in retail, which is based on attracting and retaining stable, low-cost deposits as a key funding source for pnc. we have taken a disciplined approach to pricing, focused on retaining relationship-based balances and executing on targeted deposit growth and retention strategies aimed at more rate-sensitive customers. our goal with regard to deposits is to optimize balances, economics and long-term customer growth. in 2023, average total deposits decreased compared to 2022, reflecting the impact of increased consumer spending and quantitative tightening by the federal reserve.
as part of our strategic focus on growing customers and meeting their financial needs, we operate and continue to optimize a coast-to-coast network of retail branches, solution centers and atms, which are complemented by pnc's suite of digital capabilities. in february 2024, pnc announced it would be investing close to $1.0 billion, through 2028, to open more than 100 new branches in key locations, including austin, dallas, denver, houston, miami, and san antonio, and to renovate more than 1,200 existing locations across the country to enhance the customer experience.

corporate & institutional banking earnings increased $179 million in 2023 compared with 2022, driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses, lower noninterest income and increased noninterest expense.
net interest income increased in the comparison due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits and higher average loan balances, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of loans and lower average deposit balances.
noninterest income decreased in the comparison driven by lower commercial mortgage banking activities and a decline in capital markets and advisory fees, partially offset by growth in treasury management product revenue.
provision for credit losses was primarily driven by portfolio activity, including changes in credit quality related to the commercial real estate portfolio.
average loans increased compared with 2022 due to increases in corporate banking, real estate and business credit, partially offset by a decrease in commercial banking:
•corporate banking provides lending, equipment finance, treasury management and capital markets products and services to mid-sized and large corporations, and government and not-for-profit entities. average loans for this business increased driven by strong new production throughout 2022 and the acquisition of capital commitment facilities from signature bridge bank, n.a. on october 2, 2023.
•real estate provides banking, financing and servicing solutions for commercial real estate clients across the country. average loans for this business increased largely due to new production throughout 2022, partially offset by a lower average utilization of loan commitments.
•business credit provides asset-based lending and equipment financing solutions. the loan and lease portfolio is mainly secured by business assets. average loans for this business increased, primarily driven by new production, partially offset by a lower average utilization of loan commitments.
•commercial banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets related products and services to smaller corporations and businesses. average loans for this business declined primarily driven by lower average utilization of loan commitments, paydowns outpacing new production and ppp loan forgiveness.
the deposit strategy of corporate & institutional banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining relationship-based balances over time, executing on customer and segment-specific deposit growth strategies and continuing to provide funding and liquidity to pnc. average total deposits decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting the impact of quantitative tightening by the federal reserve and included a continued shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits as deposit rates have risen. we continue to actively monitor the interest rate environment and make adjustments to our deposit strategy in response to evolving market conditions, bank funding needs and client relationship dynamics.
product revenue in addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, corporate & institutional banking offers other services, including treasury management, capital markets and advisory products and services, and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers of all business segments. on a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is included in net interest income and noninterest income, as appropriate. from a business perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is reflected in the corporate & institutional banking segment results, and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses where the customer relationships exist. the other information section in table 13 includes the consolidated revenue to pnc for treasury management and commercial mortgage banking services. a discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services follows.
the treasury management business provides corporations with cash and investment management services, receivables and disbursement management services, funds transfer services, international payment services and access to online/mobile information management and reporting services. treasury management revenue is reported in noninterest income and net interest income. noninterest income includes treasury management product revenue less earnings credits provided to customers on compensating deposit balances used to pay for products and services. net interest income includes funding credit from all treasury management customer deposit balances. compared with 2022, treasury management revenue increased due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits and higher product revenue.
commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (both net interest income and noninterest income), revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and hedges related to those activities. total revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities decreased in the comparison primarily due to lower commercial mortgage servicing income.
capital markets and advisory includes services and activities primarily related to merger and acquisition advisory, equity capital markets advisory, asset-backed financing, loan syndication, securities underwriting and customer-related trading. the decrease in capital markets and advisory fees in the comparison was mostly driven by lower merger and acquisition advisory fees and a decline in syndication fees, partially offset by higher customer-related trading revenue for derivatives, foreign exchange and fixed income.

the pnc private bank is focused on being a premier private bank in each of the markets it serves. this business seeks to deliver high quality banking, trust, and investment management services to our emerging affluent, high net worth and ultra-high net worth clients through a broad array of products and services.
institutional asset management provides outsourced chief investment officer, custody, cash and fixed income client solutions, and retirement plan fiduciary investment services to institutional clients, including corporations, healthcare systems, insurance companies, municipalities and non-profits.
asset management group earnings decreased $70 million in 2023 compared with 2022, driven by lower net interest income and noninterest income and higher noninterest expense, partially offset by provision recapture.
net interest income decreased in the comparison due to decline in average deposits as well as narrower interest rate spreads on the value of loans, partially offset by higher average loans and wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits.
noninterest income decreased in the comparison driven by lower asset management fees due to the impact of client activity.
average loans increased compared with 2022, driven by growth in residential real estate lending, partially offset by a decrease in security based lending lines of credit.
average deposits decreased in the comparison due to competitive pricing pressures as clients continue to seek higher yielding returns, including deploying funds into discretionary client assets under management.
discretionary client assets under management increased in comparison to the prior year, primarily due to higher spot equity markets as of december 31, 2023, partially offset by client activity.
risk management enterprise risk management we encounter risk as part of the normal course of operating our business. accordingly, we design our risk governance framework, referred to as the erm framework, and risk management processes to help manage this risk. we manage risk in light of our risk appetite to optimize long-term shareholder value while supporting our employees, customers and communities.
our erm framework is structurally aligned with regulatory enhanced prudential standards and heightened standards promulgated by the federal reserve and occ, respectively, which establish minimum requirements for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework. this risk management section describes our erm framework, which consists of seven core components that provide executive management and the board of directors with an aggregate view of significant risks impacting the organization. the seven core components are risk culture, enterprise strategy (including risk appetite, strategic planning, capital planning and stress testing), risk governance and oversight, risk identification, risk assessments, risk controls and monitoring, and risk aggregation and reporting (see the figure below). the overall risk management section of this item 7 also provides an analysis of the firm's capital management and our key areas of risk, which include, but are not limited to credit, market, liquidity and operational (including compliance and information security). our use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within this risk management section.
we operate within a rapidly evolving regulatory and financial services environment. accordingly, we are actively focused on the timely incorporation of applicable regulatory pronouncements and emerging risks into our erm framework.
the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k risk culture a strong risk culture helps us make well informed decisions, helps ensure individuals conform to the established culture, reduces an individual's ability to do something for personal gain, and rewards employees for working toward a common goal rather than individual interests. our risk culture reinforces the appropriate protocols for responsible and ethical behavior. these protocols are especially critical in terms of our risk awareness, risk-taking behavior and risk management practices.
managing risk is every employee's responsibility. all of our employees, individually and collectively, are responsible for ensuring the organization is performing with the utmost integrity, is applying sound risk management practices and is striving to achieve our stated objectives. all employees are also responsible for understanding our enterprise risk appetite statement, the erm framework and how risk management applies to their respective roles and responsibilities. employees are encouraged to collaborate across groups to identify and mitigate risks and elevate issues as required. we reinforce risk management responsibilities through a performance management system where employee performance goals include risk management objectives and incentives for employees to reinforce balanced measures of risk-adjusted performance.
proactive and open communication, between groups and up to the board of directors, facilitates timely identification and resolution of risk issues. our multi-level risk committee structure provides formal channels to identify and report risk.
enterprise strategy we seek to ensure that our overall enterprise strategy is within acceptable risk parameters through our risk appetite, strategic planning, capital planning and stress testing processes. these components are reviewed and approved at least annually by the board of directors or one of its committees.
risk appetite: our risk appetite represents the organization's desired enterprise risk position, set within our capital-based risk and liquidity capacity to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans. the enterprise risk appetite statement qualitatively describes the aggregate level of risk we are willing to accept in order to execute our business strategies. qualitative guiding principles further define each of the risks within our taxonomy to support the risk appetite statement. risk appetite metrics and limits, including forward-looking metrics, quantitatively measure whether we are operating within our stated risk appetite. our risk appetite metrics reflect material risks, align with our established risk appetite framework, balance risk and reward, leverage analytics, and are adjusted to changes in the external and internal risk environments.
strategic planning: our enterprise and line of business strategic plans outline major objectives, strategies and goals which are expected to be achieved over the next five years while seeking to ensure we remain compliant with all capital, risk appetite and liquidity targets and guidelines. our chief executive officer and chief financial officer lead the development of the corporate strategic plan.
capital planning and stress testing: capital planning helps to ensure we are maintaining safe and sound operations and viability. the capital planning process and the resulting capital plan evolve as our overall risks, activities and risk management practices change. capital planning aligns with our strategic planning process. stress testing is an essential element of the macroeconomic capital planning process. effective stress testing enables us to consider the estimated effect on capital of various hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios.
risk governance and oversight we employ a comprehensive risk management governance framework to help ensure that risks are identified, balanced decisions are made that consider risk and return, and risks are adequately monitored and managed. risk committees established within this risk governance and oversight framework provide oversight for risk management activities at the board of directors, executive, corporate the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k and business levels. committee composition is designed to provide effective oversight balanced across the three lines of defense in accordance with the occ's heightened standards and the federal reserve board's enhanced prudential standards. see the supervision and regulation section in item 1 of this report for more information.
to help ensure appropriate risks are being taken and effectively managed and controlled, risk is managed across three lines of defense. a summary of the board of directors' and each line of defense's responsibilities is provided below:
board of directors - the board of directors oversees our risk-taking activities, holds management accountable for adhering to the erm framework and is responsible for exercising sound, independent judgment when assessing risk.
first line of defense - the front line units are accountable for identifying, owning and managing risks to within acceptable levels while adhering to the erm framework. our businesses strive to enhance risk management and internal control processes within their areas. integrated and comprehensive processes are designed to adequately manage the business' risk profile and risk appetite through identifying, assessing, monitoring and reporting risks that may significantly impact each business.
second line of defense - the second line of defense is independent from the first line of defense and is responsible for establishing the risk governance framework and the standards within each independent risk area for identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting aggregate risks. as the second line of defense, the independent risk areas monitor the risks generated by the first line of defense, review and challenge the implementation of effective risk management practices, perform independent assessment of risk, and report on issues or exceptions. the risk areas help to ensure processes and controls owned by the businesses are designed and operating as intended.
third line of defense - as the third line of defense, internal audit is independent from the first and second lines of defense. internal audit provides the board of directors and executive management comprehensive assurance on the effectiveness of the erm framework and the risk management practices across the organization.
within the three lines of defense, the independent risk organization has sufficient authority to influence material decisions. our business oversight and decision-making is supported through a governance structure at the board of directors and management level. specific responsibilities include:
board of directors - our board of directors oversees our business and affairs as managed by our officers and employees. the board of directors may receive assistance in carrying out its duties and may delegate authority through standing or special committees. the following provides a summary of some of the key responsibilities of the board's standing committees:
•audit committee: monitors the integrity of our consolidated financial statements; monitors internal control over financial reporting; monitors compliance with our code of ethics; evaluates and monitors the qualifications and independence of our independent auditors; and evaluates and monitors the performance of our internal audit function and our independent auditors.
•nominating and governance committee: oversees the implementation of sound corporate governance principles and practices while promoting our best interests and those of our shareholders.
•human resources committee: oversees the compensation of our executive officers and other specified responsibilities related to talent and human capital matters affecting us. the committee is also responsible for evaluating the relationship between risk-taking activities and incentive compensation plans.
•risk committee: oversees our enterprise-wide risk structure and the processes established to identify, measure, monitor and manage the organization's risks and evaluates and approves our risk governance framework. the risk committee has formed a compliance subcommittee to facilitate board-level oversight of risk management in the compliance area.
•corporate responsibility committee: oversees management's corporate responsibility efforts, internally and externally, to the extent such corporate responsibility efforts are not specifically within the purview of another board committee (e.g., climate-related risks overseen by the risk committee and climate-related financial disclosures overseen by the audit committee), and implementation of pnc's publicly-announced community benefits plan to provide loans, investments and other financial support to bolster economic opportunity for low- and moderate-income individuals and communities and other underserved individuals and communities, and to help remove historic barriers in the banking system.
•technology committee: oversees technology strategy and significant technology initiatives and programs, including those that can position the use of technology to drive strategic advantages, and fulfills the oversight responsibilities delegated from the risk committee with respect to technology risk, technology risk management, data risk, cybersecurity, information security, business continuity and significant technology initiatives and programs.
management level executive committee - the management level executive committee is responsible for guiding the creation and execution of our business strategy across pnc. with this responsibility, the management level executive committee executes various strategic approval and review activities, with a focus on capital deployment, business performance and risk management. this committee also helps ensure pnc is staffed with sufficient resources and talent to operate within its risk appetite.
the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k corporate committees - the corporate committees generally operate based on the delegated approval authority from a board-level committee, the management level executive committee or other corporate committees. these committees operate at the senior management level and are designed to facilitate the review, evaluation, oversight and approval of key business and risk activities.
working committees - working committees generally operate on delegated approval authority from a corporate committee or other working committees. working committees are intended to provide oversight of regulatory/legal matters, assist in the implementation of key enterprise-level activities within a business or function and support the oversight of key risk activities.
transactional committees - transactional committees generally operate based on delegated approval authority from a corporate or working committee to approve individual transactions, transactional related activities or movements on the organization's balance sheet.
policies and procedures - we have established risk management policies and procedures to support our erm framework, articulate our risk culture, define the parameters and processes within which employees are to manage risk and conduct our business activities and to provide direction, guidance and clarity on roles and responsibilities to management and the board of directors. these policies and procedures are organized in a multi-tiered framework and require periodic review and approval by relevant committees, including where appropriate committees of the board of directors, or management.
risk identification risk identification takes place across a variety of risk types throughout the organization. these risk types include, but are not limited to, credit, liquidity and capital, market and operational (which includes, among other types of risk, compliance and information security). risks are identified based on a balanced use of analytical tools and management judgment for both on- and off-balance sheet exposures. our governance structure supports risk identification by facilitating assessment of key risk issues, emerging risks and idiosyncratic risks and implementation of mitigation strategies as appropriate. these risks are prioritized based on quantitative and qualitative analysis and assessed against our risk appetite. multiple tools and approaches are used to help identify and prioritize risks, including risk appetite metrics, key risk indicators, key performance indicators, risk and control self-assessments, scenario analysis, stress testing and special assessments.
risks are aggregated and assessed within and across risk functions and businesses. the aggregated risk information is reviewed and reported at an enterprise level to the board of directors or appropriate committees. this enterprise aggregation and reporting approach promotes the identification and appropriate escalation of material risks across the organization and supports an understanding of the cumulative impact of risk in relation to our risk appetite.
risk assessment once risks are identified, they are evaluated based on quantitative and qualitative analysis to determine whether they are material. risk assessments support the overall management of an effective erm framework and help us to control and monitor our actual risk level and risk management effectiveness. comprehensive, accurate and timely assessments of risk are essential to an effective erm framework. effective risk measurement practices are designed to uncover recurring risks that have been experienced in the past; facilitate the monitoring, understanding, analysis and reporting of known risks; and reveal unanticipated risks that may not be easy to understand or predict.
risk controls and monitoring our erm framework consists of policies, procedures, processes, personnel and control systems. risk controls and limits provide the linkage from our risk appetite statement and associated guiding principles to the risk-taking activities of our businesses. in addition to risk appetite limits, a system of more detailed internal controls exists which oversees and monitors our various processes and functions. these control systems measure performance, help employees make correct decisions, help ensure information is accurate and reliable and facilitate compliance with laws and regulations.
we design our monitoring and evaluation of risks and controls to provide assurance that policies, procedures and controls are effective and also to result in the identification of control improvement recommendations. risk monitoring is a daily, ongoing process used by both the first and second line of defense to help ensure compliance with our erm framework. risk monitoring is accomplished in many ways, including performing risk assessments at the business and risk assessment unit level, monitoring an area's key controls, the timely reporting of issues and establishing a quality control and/or quality assurance function, as applicable.
risk aggregation and reporting risk reporting is a comprehensive way to: (i) communicate aggregate risks, including identified concentrations; (ii) escalate instances where we are outside of our risk appetite; (iii) monitor our risk profile in relation to our risk appetite; and (iv) communicate risks and views on the effectiveness of our risk management activities to the board of directors and executive management.
risk reports are produced at the line of business, functional risk and enterprise levels. each individual risk report includes an assessment of inherent risk, quality of risk management, residual risk, risk appetite and risk outlook. the enterprise level risk report the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k aggregates material risks identified in the risk area reports and in the business reports to define the enterprise risk profile. the enterprise risk profile is a point-in-time assessment of enterprise risk and represents our overall risk position in relation to the desired enterprise risk appetite. the determination of the enterprise risk profile is based on analysis of quantitative reporting of risk limits and other measures along with qualitative assessments. quarterly aggregation of risk reports from the risk areas and lines of business is designed to provide a clear view of our risk level relative to our risk appetite. the enterprise level report is provided through the governance structure to the risk committee of the board of directors.
credit risk management credit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with the contractual terms of their loan, extension of credit or other financial obligation with pnc. credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities and entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. credit risk is one of our most significant risks. our processes for managing credit risk are designed to be embedded in our risk culture and in our decision-making processes using a systematic approach whereby credit risks and related exposures are identified and assessed, managed through specific policies and processes, measured and evaluated against our risk appetite and credit concentration limits, and reported, along with specific mitigation activities, to management and the board of directors through our governance structure. our most significant concentration of credit risk is in our loan portfolio.
credit risk management is working to understand and incorporate into our credit risk management framework the impacts to credit risk that may accelerate or be introduced as a result of climate change, including impacts from physical risk events and risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. these risk events may impact a borrower's income, cash flow or collateral due to the frequency or severity of weather events, changing market conditions, consumer preferences and demand for products, or changes to the legislative and regulatory landscape. as disruptive events occur, pnc follows a process to determine if enhanced portfolio monitoring, reporting and executive communication is warranted to ensure appropriate oversight and action.
to address issues that are important to the various stakeholders we serve, corporate & institutional banking transactions may be subjected to an industry-agnostic environmental and social risk management assessment designed to help us better identify and mitigate environmental, human rights and other reputational risks early in the credit application process. transactions identified as having a potential environmental, human rights or other reputational risk are evaluated to determine whether additional due diligence is warranted. credit risk management employs a governance, policy and monitoring framework for environmental and social risk topics that may include updates to pnc's credit portfolio strategy committee. outcomes from those updates may be incorporated into credit policies and risk procedures that govern our risk appetite, credit decisioning, portfolio management and reserve processes. additionally, pnc has procedures designed to ensure that flood insurance is present for properties as required by applicable regulations, while also monitoring other water-related risks (such as the increased shoreline and coastal erosion) and weather-related events (such as hurricanes and wildfires).
loan portfolio characteristics and analysis table 15: details of loans in billions the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k we use several credit quality indicators, as further detailed in note 3 loans and related allowance for credit losses, to monitor and measure our exposure to credit risk within our loan portfolio. the following provides additional information about the significant loan classes that comprise our commercial and consumer portfolio segments.
commercial commercial and industrial commercial and industrial loans comprised 55% and 56% of our total loan portfolio at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the majority of our commercial and industrial loans are secured by collateral that provides a secondary source of repayment should a borrower experience cash generation difficulties. examples of this collateral include short-term assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and securities, and long-lived assets, such as equipment, owner-occupied real estate and other business assets.
we actively manage our commercial and industrial loans to assess any changes (both positive and negative) in the level of credit risk at both the borrower and portfolio level. to evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign internal risk ratings reflecting our estimates of the borrower's pd and lgd for each related credit facility. this two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides granularity in the risk monitoring process and is updated on an ongoing basis through our credit risk management processes. in addition to monitoring the level of credit risk, we also monitor concentrations of credit risk pertaining to both specific industries and geographies that may exist in our portfolio. our commercial and industrial portfolio is well-diversified across industries as shown in the following table (based on the north american industry classification system).
owner occupied commercial real estate loans totaled $9.6 billion at december 31, 2023 and are included in commercial and industrial loans as the credit decisioning for servicing these loans is based on the financial conditions of the owner, not the ability of the collateral to generate income. owner occupied commercial real estate loans are well-diversified across industries.
commercial real estate commercial real estate loans comprised $21.0 billion related to commercial mortgages on income-producing properties, $8.0 billion of intermediate-term financing loans, and $6.4 billion of real estate construction project loans as of december 31, 2023. comparable amounts as of december 31, 2022 were $22.3 billion, $7.6 billion, and $6.4 billion, respectively. commercial real estate primarily consists of an investment in land and/or buildings held to generate income, that income serves as the primary source for the repayment of the loan. however, for all commercial real estate assets, the disposition of the assigned collateral serves as a secondary source of repayment for the loan should the borrower experience cash generation difficulties.
we monitor credit risk associated with our commercial real estate loans similar to commercial and industrial loans by analyzing pd and lgd. additionally, risks associated with commercial real estate loans tend to be correlated to the loan structure, collateral location and quality, project progress and business environment. these attributes are also monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk. the portfolio is geographically diverse due to the nature of our business involving clients throughout the u.s.
given the foundational change in office demand driven by the acceptance of remote work, real estate performance related to the office sector continues to be an area of uncertainty. at december 31, 2023, our outstanding loan balances in the office portfolio totaled $8.0 billion, or 2.5% of total loans, while additional unfunded loan commitments totaled $0.4 billion. also, the portfolio is well diversified geographically across our coast-to-coast franchise. within the office portfolio at december 31, 2023, criticized loans totaled 24.8% and nonperforming loans totaled 8.4%, while delinquencies were zero. as measured at origination, the weighted average ltv for the office portfolio was 58%; however, updated appraisals have increased the weighted average ltv to 65% as of december 31, 2023. while ltv is one consideration, our risk assessment considers a number of factors in assessing the changing conditions affecting the portfolio. as of december 31, 2023, we have established reserves of 8.7% against office loans.
the greatest stress in our office portfolio is observed in multi-tenant office loans, which represents 56% of the portfolio at december 31, 2023. within the multi-tenant classification, criticized levels were 43.4% while nonperforming loans totaled 14.5%, accounting for almost all of the nonperforming office population. the weighted average ltv for multi-tenant is 69% at december 31, 2023. additionally, all of the commercial real estate charge-offs over the last year have been multi-tenant office loans. given the higher level of stress, this segment has a proportionally higher reserve rate of 12.9%. the remaining 44% of the office portfolio is primarily comprised of single-tenant, medical and government tenant properties. this subset of the portfolio is performing considerably better, with less than 1% of the book in the criticized, delinquent and nonperforming loan categories. as of december 31, 2023, the weighted average ltv of this book is 60%.
portfolio management efforts have escalated for the office portfolio, with internal risk ratings completed for each asset quarterly, accelerated reappraisal requirements and elevated approval levels for any credit action. refreshed appraisals have updated valuations on more than 90% of the criticized office exposure over the past year. additionally, active management efforts include ongoing performance assessments as well as the review of property, lending and capital markets. portfolio updates are distributed to senior management weekly.
given the ongoing change in this area, we expect additional stress in the office sector. however, we continue to actively manage the portfolio, and we believe reserve levels adequately reflect the expected credit losses in the portfolio.
we obtain loan attributes at origination, including fico scores and ltvs, and we update these and other credit metrics at least quarterly. we track borrower performance monthly. we also segment the mortgage portfolio into pools based on product type (e.g., nonconforming or conforming). this information is used for internal reporting and risk management. as part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy status, fico scores, ltv and geographic concentrations.
we originate residential mortgage loans nationwide through our national mortgage business as well as within our branch network. residential mortgage loans underwritten to agency standards, including conforming loan amount limits, are typically sold with servicing retained by us. we also originate nonconforming residential mortgage loans that do not meet agency standards, which we retain on our balance sheet. our portfolio of originated nonconforming residential mortgage loans totaled $42.4 billion at december 31, 2023 with 45% located in california. comparable amounts at december 31, 2022 were $40.6 billion and 44%, respectively.
home equity home equity loans comprised $20.6 billion of home equity lines of credit and $5.6 billion of closed-end home equity installment loans at december 31, 2023. comparable amounts were $19.5 billion and $6.5 billion as of december 31, 2022, respectively. home equity lines of credit are a variable interest rate product with fixed rate conversion options available to certain borrowers.
similar to residential real estate loans, we track borrower performance of this portfolio on a monthly basis. we also segment the population into pools based on product type (e.g., home equity loans, legacy brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit or legacy brokered home equity lines of credit) and track the historical performance of any related mortgage loans regardless of whether we hold such liens. this information is used for internal reporting and risk management. as part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy status, fico scores, ltv, lien position and geographic concentration.
the credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we hold the first lien position is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position, but do not hold the first lien. lien position information is generally determined at the time of origination and monitored on an ongoing basis for risk management purposes. we use a third-party service provider to obtain updated loan information, including lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources.
the following table presents certain key statistics related to our home equity portfolio:
table 19: home equity loan statistics december 31, 2023                                       december 31, 2022
total home equity loans                                    $26,150                          100     %              $25,983                          100     %
automobile auto loans comprised $13.8 billion in the indirect auto portfolio and $1.1 billion in the direct auto portfolio as of december 31, 2023. comparable amounts as of december 31, 2022 were $13.7 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. the indirect auto portfolio consists of loans originated primarily through independent franchised dealers, including dealers located in our new expansion markets. this business is strategically aligned with our core retail banking business.
we continue to focus on borrowers with strong credit profiles as evidenced by the weighted-average loan origination fico scores noted in table 20. we offer both new and used auto financing to customers through our various channels. at december 31, 2023, the portfolio balance was composed of 45% new vehicle loans and 55% used vehicle loans. comparable amounts at december 31, 2022 were 50% and 50%, respectively.
the auto loan portfolio's performance is measured monthly, including updated collateral values that are obtained monthly and updated fico scores that are obtained at least quarterly. for internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the portfolio by product channel and product type and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience. as part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the portfolio by geography, channel, collateral attributes and credit metrics which include fico score, ltv and term.
the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k nonperforming assets and loan delinquencies nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of contractual principal and interest is not probable and include nonperforming loans whose terms were modified as a result of a borrower's financial difficulty and pcd loans, oreo and foreclosed assets. loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. see note 1 accounting policies for details on our nonaccrual policies.
allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans (c)                                     250       %                      274       %
(a)in connection with the adoption of asu 2022-02 financial instruments - credit losses (topic 326): troubled debt restructurings and vintage disclosures, nonperforming loans as of december 31, 2023 include certain loans where terms were modified as a result of a borrower's financial difficulty. prior period amounts included nonperforming tdrs, for which accounting guidance was eliminated effective january 1, 2023. see note 1 accounting policies and the loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty section of note 3 loans and related allowance for more information on our adoption of this asu.
(b)excludes most unsecured consumer loans and lines of credit, which are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and are not placed on nonperforming status.
(c)calculated excluding allowances for investment securities and other financial assets.
principal activity, including paydowns and payoffs                    (831)                   (868)
loan delinquencies we regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels are a key indicator of credit quality in our loan portfolio. measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. loans that are 30 days or more past due are considered delinquent. loan delinquencies include government insured or guaranteed loans, loans accounted for under the fair value option and pcd loans. amounts exclude loans held for sale.
we manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower, repayment sources, underlying collateral, and other support given current events, economic conditions and expectations. we refine our practices to meet the changing environment, such as inflation levels, industry specific risks, interest rate levels, the level of consumer savings and deposit balances, and structural and secular changes fostered by the pandemic. to mitigate losses and enhance customer support, we offer loan modifications and collection programs to assist our customers. the cares act credit reporting rules expired in the third quarter of 2023 and, as such, delinquency status at december 31, 2023 is being reported for all loans based on the contractual terms of the loan. amounts as of december 31, 2022 continue to be presented in accordance with the credit reporting rules under the cares act, which required certain loans the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k modified due to pandemic-related hardships to not be reported as past due based on the contractual terms of the loan, even when borrowers may not have made payments on their loans during the modification period.
accruing loans past due 90 days or more continue to accrue interest because they are (i) well secured by collateral and are in the process of collection, (ii) managed in homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines, or (iii) certain government insured or guaranteed loans. as such, they are excluded from nonperforming loans.
loan modifications we provide relief to our customers experiencing financial hardships through a variety of solutions. commercial loan and lease modifications are based on each individual borrower's situation, while consumer loan modifications are evaluated under our hardship relief programs.
on january 1, 2023, we adopted asu 2022-02 financial instruments - credit losses (topic 326): troubled debt restructurings and vintage disclosures, which eliminates the accounting guidance for tdrs and enhances the disclosure requirements for certain loan modifications when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. refer to note 1 accounting policies and note 3 loans and related allowance for credit losses for additional information on our adoption of this asu.
allowance for credit losses our determination of the acl is based on historical loss and performance experience, current economic conditions, the reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and other relevant factors, including current borrower and/or transaction characteristics and assessments of the remaining estimated contractual term as of the balance sheet date. we maintain the acl at an appropriate level for expected losses on our existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases, other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments.
we use forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses for our reasonable and supportable forecast period. for this purpose, we have established a framework which includes a three-year forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios and associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic outcomes. forward-looking information, such as forecasted relevant macroeconomic variables, is incorporated into the expected credit loss estimates using quantitative macroeconomic models, as well as through analysis from pnc's economists and management's judgment.
the reversion period is used to bridge our three-year reasonable and supportable forecast period and the long-run average expected credit losses. we consider a number of factors in determining the duration of the reversion period, such as contractual maturity of the asset, observed historical patterns and the estimated credit loss rates at the end of the forecast period relative to the beginning of the long run average period. the reversion period is typically 1-3 years, if not immediate.
the long-run average expected credit losses are derived from available historical credit information. we use long-run average expected losses for the portfolio over the estimated remaining contractual term beyond our reasonable and supportable forecast period and the reversion period.
the following discussion provides additional information on our reserves for loans and leases as well as unfunded lending related commitments. see note 1 accounting policies for further discussion on our acl, including details of our methodologies and the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k discussion of the allowances for investment securities and other financial assets. see also the critical accounting estimates and judgments section of this report for further discussion of the assumptions used in the determination of the acl as of december 31, 2023.
allowance for loan and lease losses our pooled expected credit loss methodology is based upon the quantification of pd, lgd, ead and the remaining estimated contractual term for a loan, loan segment or lease. we also consider the impact of prepayments and amortization on the estimated contractual term in our expected loss estimates. we use historical data, current borrower characteristics and forecasted economic variables in quantitative methods to estimate these risk parameters by loan, loan segment or lease. pds represent a quantification of risk of the likelihood that a borrower may not be able to pay their contractual obligation over a defined period of time. lgd describes the estimated magnitude of potential loss if a borrower were to default, and ead (or utilization rates for certain revolving loans) is the estimated balance outstanding at the expected time of default. these parameters are calculated for each forecasted scenario and the long-run average period, and are combined to generate expected loss estimates by scenario in proportion to the scenario weights.
prior to january 1, 2023, we used a discounted cash flow methodology for our consumer real estate related loan classes and certain tdrs. effective january 1, 2023, we discontinued our use of the discounted cash flow methodology, and we now use a pooled expected credit loss methodology as described above.
for loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with a pool of loans, we establish individually assessed reserves using methods prescribed by gaap. reserves for individual commercial nonperforming loans exceeding a defined dollar threshold are based on an analysis of the present value of the loan's expected future cash flows or the fair value of the collateral, if appropriate under our policy for collateral dependent loans. commercial nonperforming loans that are below the defined threshold are collectively reserved for, as we believe these loans continue to share similar risk characteristics. for consumer nonperforming loans classified as collateral dependent, charge-off and alll related to recovery of amounts previously charged-off are evaluated through an analysis of the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell.
while our reserve models and methodologies strive to reflect all relevant expected credit risk factors, there continues to be uncertainty associated with, but not limited to, potential imprecision in the estimation process due to the inherent time lag of obtaining information and normal variations between expected and actual outcomes. we may hold additional reserves that are designed to provide coverage for losses attributable to such risks. a portion of the allowance is related to qualitative measurement factors. these factors may include, but are not limited to:
•industry concentrations and conditions,
•changes in market conditions, including regulatory and legal requirements,
•recent credit quality trends,
•limitations of available input data, including historical loss information and recent data such as collateral values,
•model imprecision and limitations,
•changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in loss recognition and mitigation policies and procedures, and
allowance for unfunded lending related commitments we maintain the allowance for unfunded lending related commitments on off-balance sheet credit exposures that are not unconditionally cancelable, (e.g., unfunded loan commitments, letters of credit and certain financial guarantees) at a level we believe is appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on these exposures. other than the estimation of the probability of funding, this reserve is estimated in a manner similar to the methodology used for determining reserves for pooled loans and leases. the allowance for unfunded lending related commitments is recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet. net adjustments to this reserve are included in the provision for credit losses on the consolidated income statement.

total net charge-offs increased $147 million, or 26%, in 2023 compared to 2022. the increase in the comparison was driven by higher net charge-offs in both our commercial and consumer portfolios and was primarily attributable to increases in commercial real estate and credit card, partially offset by declines in other consumer and commercial and industrial.

liquidity and capital management liquidity risk has two fundamental components. the first is potential loss assuming we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost. the second is the potential inability to operate our businesses because adequate contingent liquidity is not available. we manage liquidity risk at the consolidated company level (bank, parent company and all subsidiaries combined) to help ensure that we can obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal "business as usual" and stressful circumstances, and to help ensure that we maintain an appropriate level of contingent liquidity. to ensure a strong liquidity position and compliance with regulatory requirements, management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities.
management monitors liquidity through a series of early warning indicators that may indicate a potential market, or pnc-specific, liquidity stress event. in addition, management performs a set of internal liquidity stress tests over multiple time horizons with varying levels of severity and maintains a contingency funding plan to address a potential liquidity stress event. in the most severe liquidity stress simulation, we assume that our liquidity position is under pressure, while the market in general is under systemic pressure. the simulation considers, among other things, the impact of restricted access to both secured and unsecured external sources of funding, accelerated runoff of customer deposits, valuation pressure on assets and heavy demand to fund committed obligations. parent company stress coverage limits and operating liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k meet our parent company obligations over the succeeding 24-month period. liquidity-related risk limits and operating guidelines are established within our enterprise liquidity management policy covering regulatory metrics and various concentration limits. management committees, including the alco, and the board of directors and its risk committee regularly review compliance with key established limits. pnc was in compliance with all relevant internal and regulatory liquidity limits and guidelines during 2023.
one of the ways we monitor our liquidity is by reference to the lcr, a regulatory minimum liquidity requirement designed to ensure that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs over the course of a hypothetical 30-day stress scenario. pnc and pnc bank calculate the lcr daily and are required to maintain a regulatory minimum of 100%. the lcr for both pnc and pnc bank exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement throughout the year for 2023, 2022 and 2021. fluctuations in our average lcr result from changes to the components of the calculation, including high-quality liquid assets and net cash outflows, as a result of ongoing business activity.
the nsfr is designed to measure the stability of the maturity structure of assets and liabilities of banking organizations over a one-year time horizon. pnc and pnc bank calculate the nsfr daily and are required to maintain a regulatory minimum of 100%. pnc and pnc bank have maintained nsfr compliance since the metric became effective on july 1, 2021.
we provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on us in the supervision and regulation section of item 1 business and item 1a risk factors of this report.
sources of liquidity our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses. these deposits provide relatively stable and low-cost funding. total deposits decreased to $421.4 billion at december 31, 2023 from $436.3 billion at december 31, 2022 and included a continued shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposit products as a result of the elevated interest rate environment. as of december 31, 2023, uninsured deposits represented approximately 44% of our total deposit base. the majority of our uninsured deposits are related to commercial operating and relationship accounts, which we define as commercial deposit customers who utilize two or more pnc products. see the funding sources portion of the consolidated balance sheet review and business segments review sections of this financial review for additional information on our deposits and related strategies.
we also obtain liquidity through various forms of funding, including long-term debt (senior notes, subordinated debt and fhlb borrowings) and short-term borrowings (securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings). in addition, pnc joined the federal reserve's standing repo facility on october 20, 2023, which allows eligible banks, such as pnc bank, to borrow overnight in exchange for u.s treasury, agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities. see the funding sources section of the consolidated balance sheet review in this financial review and note 9 borrowed funds included in this report for additional information related to our borrowings.
total senior and subordinated debt, on a consolidated basis, increased during 2023 due to the following activity:
calls and maturities         (2.3)
additionally, certain liquid assets and unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to manage our liquidity position. pnc has a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments, particularly in the event of liquidity stress. this plan is designed to examine and quantify the organization's liquidity under various internal liquidity stress scenarios and is periodically tested to assess the plan's reliability. additionally, the plan provides the strategies for addressing liquidity needs and responsive actions we would consider during liquidity stress events, which could include the issuance of incremental debt, preferred stock, or additional deposit actions, including the issuance of brokered cds. the plan also addresses the governance, frequency of reporting and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of liquidity stress.
the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k pnc defines our primary contingent liquidity sources as cash held at the federal reserve bank, investment securities and unused borrowing capacity at the fhlb and federal reserve bank. the following table summarizes our primary contingent liquidity sources at december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022:
table 27: primary contingent liquidity sources in billions                                                        december 31, 2023       december 31, 2022

(a)represents the fair value of investment securities that are available for sale or that can be used for pledging or to secure other sources of funding.
(b)at december 31, 2023, total fhlb borrowing capacity was $73.4 billion and total fhlb borrowings were $38.0 billion. comparable amounts at december 31, 2022 were $75.0 billion and $32.1 billion, respectively.
(c)total borrowing capacity with the federal reserve bank was $47.2 billion at december 31, 2023 and $24.3 at december 31, 2022. pnc had no outstanding borrowings with the federal reserve bank at december 31, 2023 and 2022.
bank liquidity in addition to our primary contingent liquidity sources, under pnc bank's 2014 bank note program, as amended, pnc bank may from time to time offer up to $40.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes with maturity dates more than nine months (in the case of senior notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated notes) from their date of issue. at december 31, 2023, pnc bank's remaining capacity to issue under the program was $33.3 billion.
under pnc bank's 2013 commercial paper program, pnc bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. as of december 31, 2023, there were no issuances outstanding under this program.
additionally, pnc bank may also access funding from the parent company through deposits placed at the bank or issuing intercompany senior unsecured notes.
parent company liquidity in addition to managing liquidity risk at the bank level, we monitor the parent company's liquidity. the parent company's contractual obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. additionally, the parent company maintains liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to our shareholders, share repurchases and acquisitions.
as of december 31, 2023, available parent company liquidity totaled $20.6 billion. parent company liquidity is held in intercompany cash and investments. for investments with longer durations, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the maturity of parent company debt obligations.
the principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends or other capital distributions it receives from pnc bank, which may be impacted by the following:
•bank-level capital needs,
•laws, regulations and the results of supervisory activities,
there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a national bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries. the amount available for dividend payments by pnc bank to the parent company without prior regulatory approval was $6.3 billion at december 31, 2023. see note 19 regulatory matters for further discussion of these limitations.
in addition to dividends from pnc bank, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. we can also generate liquidity for the parent company and pnc's non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt and equity securities, including certain capital instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper. under the parent company's 2014 commercial paper program, the parent company has the ability to offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. at december 31, 2023, there were no issuances outstanding under this program.

contractual obligations and commitments we enter into various contractual arrangements in the normal course of business, certain of which require future payments that could impact our liquidity and capital resources. these obligations include commitments to extend credit, outstanding letters of credit, customer deposits, borrowed funds, operating lease payments and future pension and post-retirement benefits. for further discussion related to these contractual obligations and other commitments, see note 6 leases, note 8 time deposits, note 9 borrowed funds, note 10 commitments and note 16 employee benefit plans.
credit ratings pnc's credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short and long-term funding, collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments and the ability to offer certain products.
in general, rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k government support. a decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access to the capital markets and/or increase the cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition. for additional information on the potential impacts from a downgrade to our credit ratings, see item 1a risk factors in this report.

(a) on august 7, 2023, the moody's rating outlook on pnc's long-term issuer rating, long-term local currency bank deposits and senior unsecured local currency notes was changed to negative from stable, reflecting the current pressures on the u.s. banking sector.
capital management we manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing or redeeming debt, issuing equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions or repurchases and managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.
on february 7, 2023, pnc issued 1,500,000 depositary shares each representing 1/100th ownership in a share of 6.250% fixed-rate reset non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series w, with a par value of $1 per share.
on november 1, 2023, pnc redeemed $1.0 billion of depositary shares representing interests in pnc's fixed-to-floating non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, series o. each depositary share represents 1/100th interest in a share of the series o preferred stock.
in 2023, we returned $3.1 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends on common shares of $2.5 billion and repurchases of 4.0 million common shares for $0.6 billion. consistent with the scb framework, which allows for capital return in amounts in excess of the scb minimum levels, our board of directors has authorized a repurchase framework under the previously approved repurchase program of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 45% were still available for repurchase at december 31, 2023. in light of the federal banking agencies proposed rules to adjust the basel iii capital framework, share repurchase activity is expected to remain modest during the first quarter of 2024. pnc continues to evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rules and may adjust share repurchase activity depending on market and economic conditions, as well as other factors. pnc's scb for the four-quarter period beginning october 1, 2023 is the regulatory minimum of 2.5%.
see the supervision and regulation section of item 1 business in this report for further information concerning the ccar and dfast process and the factors the federal reserve takes into consideration in its evaluation of capital plans.

(a)the ratios are calculated to reflect pnc's election to adopt the cecl five-year transition provisions. effective for the first quarter 2022, pnc is now in the three-year transition period and the full impact of the cecl standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through december 31, 2024.
(b)the ratios are calculated to reflect the full impact of cecl and exclude the benefits of the optional five-year transition.
(c)as permitted, pnc and pnc bank have elected to exclude aoci related to both available for sale securities and pension and other post-retirement plans from cet1 capital.
(d)basel iii standardized approach risk-weighted-assets are based on the basel iii standardized approach rules and include credit and market risk-weighted assets.
(e)the supplementary leverage ratio is calculated based on tier 1 capital divided by supplementary leverage exposure, which takes into account the quarterly average of both on balance sheet assets as well as certain off-balance sheet items, including loan commitments and potential future exposure under derivative contracts.
(f)all ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to pnc and calculated based on the standardized approach.
(g)leverage ratio is calculated based on tier 1 capital divided by average quarterly adjusted total assets.
pnc's regulatory risk-based capital ratios are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. under the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight. exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, nonaccruals, fdms, past due exposures and equity exposures are generally subject to higher risk weights than other types of exposures.
the regulatory agencies have adopted a rule permitting certain banks, including pnc, to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from implementing cecl. cecl's estimated impact on cet1 capital, as defined by the rule, is the change in retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in cecl acl at the balance sheet date, excluding the allowance for pcd loans, compared to cecl acl at adoption. effective for the first quarter of 2022, pnc is now in the three-year transition period, and the full impact of the cecl standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through december 31, 2024. see additional discussion of this rule in the supervision and regulation section of item 1 business and item 1a risk factors.
at december 31, 2023, pnc and pnc bank were considered "well capitalized," based on applicable u.s. regulatory capital ratio requirements. to qualify as "well capitalized", pnc must have basel iii capital ratios of at least 6% for tier 1 risk-based capital and 10% for total risk-based capital, and pnc bank must have basel iii capital ratios of at least 6.5% for common equity tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% for tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for total risk-based capital and a leverage ratio of at least 5%.
federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest u.s. bhcs, including pnc, to have a level of regulatory capital well in excess of the regulatory minimum and have required the largest u.s. bhcs, including pnc, to have a capital buffer sufficient to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. we seek to manage the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and we believe that our december 31, 2023 capital levels were aligned with them.
we provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts, including the proposed rules to adjust the basel iii framework, in the supervision and regulation section of item 1 business, item 1a risk factors and note 19 regulatory matters.
market risk management market risk is the risk of a loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. we are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in the following activities, among others:
•traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans,
•fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange activities, as a result of customer activities, securities underwriting and our investment portfolio, and
•other investments, including equity, and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors.
we have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. market risk management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with established guidelines and reporting significant risks in the business to management committees and, where appropriate, the risk committee of the board of directors.
market risk management - interest rate risk interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources. due to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.
our asset and liability management group centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our market risk-related risk management policies, which are approved by management's alco and the risk committee of the board of directors.
pnc utilizes sensitivities of nii and eve to a set of interest rate scenarios to identify and measure its short-term and long-term structural interest rate risks.
nii sensitivity results for the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022 follow:
table 31: net interest income sensitivity analysis fourth quarter 2023                 fourth quarter 2022
net interest income sensitivity simulation (a)
when forecasting net interest income, we make certain key assumptions that can materially impact the resulting sensitivities, including the following:
future balance sheet composition: our balance sheet composition is dynamic and based on our forecasted expectations. as of the fourth quarter 2023, the projected balance sheet composition by the end of year one is generally consistent with the spot composition as of the fourth quarter 2023.
deposit betas: deposit pricing changes are primarily driven by changes in the federal funds rate, with the relationship between deposit rates and federal funds rate defined as deposit beta. we define cumulative deposit beta as the change in deposit rate paid on interest bearing non-maturity deposits divided by the change in the upper level of the stated federal funds rate range since the first quarter of 2022, the start of the current rising rate cycle. as of december 2023, pnc's cumulative deposit beta was 44%, an increase from 31% at december 2022. for interest rate risk modeling, pnc uses dynamic beta models to adjust assumed repricing sensitivity depending on market rate levels as well as other factors. the dynamic beta assumptions reflect historical experience and future expectations. our scenario assumes that deposit betas slightly increase from current levels. actual deposit rate paid may differ from modeled projections due to variables such as competition for deposits and customer behavior.
the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k asset prepayments: pnc includes prepayment assumptions for both loan and investment portfolios. mortgage and home equity portfolios utilize an industry standard model to drive estimated prepayments that increase in lower rate environments. commercial and consumer loan portfolios assume static constant prepayment rates that are consistent across rate scenarios, as those portfolios historically do not exhibit significantly different prepayment behaviors based upon the level of market rates.
impact of derivatives: pnc uses interest rate derivatives to hedge floating rate commercial loans. pnc had $33.3 billion in receive fix / pay float swaps as of december 31, 2023, with a weighted average duration of 2.3 years and an average fixed rate of 2.1%. as of december 31, 2023 pnc also had collars in place, reflecting $12.5 billion of caps and $12.5 billion of floors, that are used to hedge these commercial loans. additionally, pnc utilizes receive fix / pay float swaps as a means of hedging fixed rate debt. see note 15 financial derivatives for additional information on how we use derivatives to hedge commercial loans and fixed rate debt.
eve sensitivity results for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022 follow:
table 32: economic value of equity sensitivity analysis fourth quarter 2023        fourth quarter 2022
economic value of equity sensitivity simulation
eve measures the present value of all projected future cash flows associated with a point-in-time balance sheet and does not include projected new volume. eve sensitivity to interest rate changes is a complementary metric to nii sensitivity analysis and represents an estimation of long-term interest rate risk. pnc calculates its eve sensitivity by measuring the changes in the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments in response to an instantaneous +/-200 bps parallel shift in interest rates. similar to the nii sensitivity analysis, we incorporate dynamic deposit repricing and loan prepayment assumptions. these methodologies are largely consistent between the eve and nii sensitivity analyses. additionally, deposit attrition is a significant contributor to eve sensitivity. deposit attrition is projected based on a dynamic model developed using long-term historical deposit behavior in addition to management assumptions including accelerated attrition for pandemic related excess deposits. pnc performs various sensitivity analyses to understand the impact of faster and slower deposit attrition on our risk metrics, with the results reported to the alco.
compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, there have been no material changes to our nii sensitivity and eve sensitivity assumptions, including data sources that drive assumptions setting.
market risk management - customer-related trading risk we engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers' investing and hedging activities. these transactions, related hedges and the credit valuation adjustment related to our customer derivatives portfolio are marked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities. we do not engage in proprietary trading of these products.
we use var as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. var is used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors. a diversified var reflects empirical correlations across different asset classes. we calculate a diversified var at a 95% confidence interval and the results for 2023 and 2022 were within our acceptable limits.
to help ensure the integrity of the models used to calculate var for each portfolio and enterprise-wide, we use a process known as backtesting. the backtesting process consists of comparing actual observations of gains or losses against the var levels that were calculated at the close of the prior day. our var measure assumes that exposures remain constant and that recent market variability is a good predictor of future variability. actual observations include customer-related revenue and intraday hedging, which helps to reduce losses and can reduce the number of instances actual losses exceed the prior day var measure. there were no instances during 2023 and 2022 under our diversified var measure where actual losses exceeded the prior-day var measure. our portfolio and enterprise-wide var models utilize a historical approach with a 500-day look-back period.
customer-related trading revenue was $137 million in 2023 compared with $382 million in 2022 and is recorded in capital markets and advisory and other interest income on our consolidated income statement. the decrease was primarily due to higher funding costs in the derivative and security trading desks, partially offset by improved foreign exchange client sales revenues.
market risk management - equity and other investment risk equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. in addition to extending credit, taking deposits, underwriting securities and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations and growth financings in a variety of industries. we also have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity, consistent with regulatory limitations. the economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets are directly affected by changes in market factors.
the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k various pnc business units manage our equity and other investment activities. our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines.
a summary of our equity investments follows:
table 33: equity investments summary dollars in millions                   december 31 2023                 december 31 2022   change
tax credit investments                  $4,331                           $4,308           $23            1                %
private equity and other                 3,983                            4,129           (146)                     (4)   %
tax credit investments included in our equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated entities. these tax credit investment balances included unfunded commitments totaling $2.5 billion at both december 31, 2023 and 2022. these unfunded commitments are included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.
note 4 loan sale and servicing activities and variable interest entities has further information on tax credit investments.
private equity and other the largest component of our other equity investments is our private equity portfolio. the private equity portfolio is an illiquid portfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $2.2 billion at december 31, 2023 and $1.8 billion at december 31, 2022, respectively. as of december 31, 2023, $2.0 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies, and $0.2 billion was invested indirectly through various private equity funds. see the supervision and regulation section in item 1 of this report for discussion of the volcker rule limitations on our interests in and relationships with private funds.
included in our other equity investments are visa class b common shares, which are recorded at cost. visa class b common shares that we own are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into shares of the publicly-traded class a common shares. based upon the december 31, 2023 per share closing price of $260.35 for a visa class a common share, the estimated value of our total investment in the class b common shares was approximately $1.5 billion at the current conversion rate of visa b shares to visa a shares, while our cost basis was insignificant. see note 14 fair value and note 20 legal proceedings for additional information regarding our visa agreements, and visa's amendments to its certificate of incorporation to institute a conversion and exchange offer program that would release transfer restrictions on portions of the visa class b common shares. the estimated value does not represent fair value of the visa b common shares given the shares' limited transferability and the lack of observable transactions in the marketplace.
we also have certain other equity investments, the majority of which represent investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. net gains related to these investments were $18 million in 2023 and $45 million in 2022.
impact of inflation our assets and liabilities are primarily financial in nature and typically have varying maturity dates. accordingly, future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money. however, during periods of inflation, there may be a subsequent impact affecting certain fixed costs or expenses, an erosion of consumer and customer purchasing power, and fluctuations in the need or demand for our products and services. when significant levels of inflation occur, our business could potentially be impacted by, among other things, reducing our tolerance for extending credit or causing us to incur additional credit losses resulting from possible increased default rates. throughout 2023, the federal reserve monetary policy has tightened with the intent to slow inflation, which has led to larger increases in interest rates. see risk factors in item 1a, our executive summary and cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements in this item 7 for further discussion of inflation and its overall impact to the economy, our borrowers' ability to repay their obligations and certain costs and expenses to pnc.
financial derivatives we use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to market (primarily interest rate) and credit risk inherent in our business activities. we also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities.
financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, market and credit risk. derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k notional and an underlying as specified in the contract. therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments.
not all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.
operational risk management operational risk is the risk to the current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct or adverse external events. operational risk is inherent to the entire organization.
operational risk management is embedded in our culture and decision-making processes through a systematic approach whereby operational risks and exposures are: (i) identified and assessed; (ii) managed through the design and implementation of controls; (iii) measured and evaluated against our risk tolerance limits; and (iv) appropriately reported to management and the risk committee of the board of directors. strong operational risk management and well-informed risk-based decisions benefit us by improving the customer experience, enhancing compliance, reducing reputational risk, minimizing losses and establishing an appropriate amount of required operational risk capital held by us.
the operational risk management framework is designed to provide effective and consistent management of operational risk. the primary purpose of the framework is to enable us to understand our operational risks and manage them to the desired risk profile, in line with our risk appetite. additionally, the guidance established within the framework assists management in making well-informed risk-based business decisions.
the framework provides a disciplined and structured process for us to manage operational risk across eight operational risk domains. these domains provide a comprehensive view of operational risk and allow us to discuss operational risk in a standard way, facilitating reporting and ongoing risk mitigation.
•compliance: risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, self-regulatory standards or other regulatory requirements.
•data management: risk associated with incomplete or inaccurate data.
•model: risk associated with the design, implementation and ongoing use and management of models.
•technology and systems: risk associated with the use, operation and adoption of technology.
•information security: risk resulting from the failure to protect information and ensure appropriate access to, and use and handling of, information assets.
•business continuity: risk of potential disruptive events to business activities.
•third party: risk arising from failure of third-party providers to conduct activity in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with contract provisions and applicable laws and regulations.
we utilize operational risk management programs within the framework, including risk and control self-assessments, scenario analysis, and internal and external loss event reviews and analysis, to assess existing risks, determine potential/emerging risks and evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls. program tools and methodology assist our business managers in identifying potential risks and control gaps.
lines of business are responsible for identifying, owning, managing and monitoring the operational risks and controls associated with their business activities and product or service offerings to within acceptable levels. centralized functions, such as business continuity, enterprise third party management and information security, are responsible for the development, implementation and management of their individual programs and for the development and maintenance of the policies, procedures, methodologies, tools and technology utilized across the enterprise to identify, assess, monitor and report program risks. additionally, independent risk management reviews and challenges line of business adherence to the framework to help ensure proper controls are in place and appropriate risk mitigation plans are established as necessary.
conduct, reputational and strategic risk pnc's risk culture seeks to reinforce the appropriate protocols for responsible and ethical behavior through sound processes and controls. in order to promote a robust risk culture, the board and executive management establish code of conduct and professional standards to which all employees must adhere. a strong risk culture discourages misconduct and supports conduct risk management at pnc. conduct risk is defined as the risk that employees fail to comply with the ethical standards expected of them. strong conduct the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k risk management is important in supporting pnc's reputation, and pnc maintains a corporate culture that emphasizes complying with laws, regulations, and managing reputational risks. reputational risk is the risk to the franchise and/or shareholder value based on a negative perception of pnc by its stakeholders and/or the changing expectations of its stakeholders. strategic risk is another component of the erm framework that is also critical to optimizing shareholder returns. strategic risk is the risk to earnings that may arise from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of business decisions and/or inadequate response to changes in the business environment. strategic risk is considered and assessed by our businesses in the annual strategic planning processes and monitored on an on-going basis as those plans are carried out.
compliance risk enterprise compliance is responsible for oversight of compliance risk for the organization. compliance issues are identified and tracked through enterprise-wide monitoring and testing activities. compliance risk issues are escalated through a comprehensive risk reporting process at both a business and enterprise level and incorporated, as appropriate, into the development and assessment of our operational risk profile. a management committee, chaired by the chief compliance officer, is responsible for oversight of compliance and fiduciary risk management programs across pnc. enterprise compliance, through the regulatory change program, helps pnc understand and proactively address emerging regulatory topics and risks as well as respond to changes in applicable laws and regulations. to understand emerging issues impacting the industry, enterprise compliance communicates regularly with various regulators having supervisory or regulatory responsibilities with respect to us, our subsidiaries, or businesses and participates in forums focused on regulatory and compliance matters in the financial services industry.
information security risk the information security component of our operational risk management framework is responsible for protecting information assets to achieve business objectives, which includes cybersecurity. pnc's cybersecurity program is designed to identify risks to sensitive information, protect that information, detect threats and events and maintain an appropriate response and recovery capability to help ensure resilience against information security incidents. the program includes, among other things, annual security and privacy training for all pnc employees and quarterly phishing exercises to raise employee awareness. our security program is also regularly examined by federal regulators for compliance with financial regulations and standards. the program also establishes expectations for information asset management, system development security, identity and access management, incident management, threat and vulnerability management, security operations management and third- and fourth-party security. for additional information, see item 1c cybersecurity of this report.
critical accounting estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. note 1 accounting policies describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. certain of these policies require us to make estimates or economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions, and such variations may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods.
allowance for credit losses we maintain the acl at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on our existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases, other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments, for the remaining estimated contractual term of the assets or exposures, taking into consideration expected prepayments and estimated recoveries. our determination of the acl is based on historical loss and performance experience, as well as current borrower and transaction characteristics including collateral type and quality, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and other relevant factors. we use methods sensitive to changes in economic conditions to interpret these factors and to estimate expected credit losses. we evaluate and, when appropriate, enhance the quality of our data and models and other methods used to estimate the acl on an ongoing basis. we incorporate qualitative factors in the acl that reflect our best estimate of expected losses that may not be adequately represented in our quantitative methods or economic assumptions. the major drivers of acl estimates include, but are not limited to:
•current economic conditions: our forecast of expected losses depends on economic conditions as of the estimation date. as current economic conditions evolve, forecasted losses could be materially affected.
•scenario weights and design: our loss estimates are sensitive to the shape, direction and rate of change of macroeconomic forecasts and thus vary significantly between upside and downside scenarios. changes to the probability weights assigned to these scenarios and the timing of peak business cycles reflected by the scenarios could materially affect our loss estimates.
•current borrower quality: our forecast of expected losses depends on current borrower and transaction characteristics, including credit metrics and collateral type/quality. as borrower quality evolves, forecasted losses could be materially affected.
•portfolio composition: changes to portfolio volume and mix could materially affect our estimates, as cecl reserves would be recognized upon origination or acquisition and derecognized upon paydown, maturity or sale.
the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k for all assets and unfunded lending related commitments within the scope of the cecl standard, the applicable acl is composed of one or a combination of the following components: (i) collectively assessed or pooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed reserves, and
(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. our methodologies and key assumptions for each of these components are discussed in note 1 accounting policies.
reasonable and supportable economic forecast pursuant to the cecl standard, we are required to consider reasonable and supportable forecasts in estimating expected credit losses. for this purpose, we have established a framework that includes a three-year forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios with associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic outcomes. credit losses estimated in our reasonable and supportable forecast period are sensitive to the shape and severity of the scenarios used and weights assigned to them.
to forecast the distribution of economic outcomes over the reasonable and supportable forecast period, we generate four economic forecast scenarios using a combination of quantitative macroeconomic models, other measures of economic activity and forward-looking expert judgment. each scenario is then given an associated probability (weight) to represent our current expectation within that distribution over the forecast period. this process is informed by current economic conditions, expected business cycle evolution and the expert judgment of pnc's rac. this approach seeks to provide a reasonable representation of the forecast of expected economic outcomes and is used to estimate expected credit losses across a variety of loans, securities and other financial assets. each quarter, the scenarios are presented to rac for approval, and the committee also approves cecl scenario weights for use during the current reporting period.
the scenarios used for the period ended december 31, 2023 consider, among other factors, the ongoing inflationary pressures and the corresponding tightening of monetary policy and credit availability.
we used a number of economic variables in our scenarios, with two of the most significant drivers being real gdp and the u.s. unemployment rate. the following table presents a comparison of these two economic variables based on the weighted-average scenario forecasts used in determining our acl at december 31, 2023 and 2022.
real gdp growth is expected to slow from 3.1% in 2023 to just 0.1% in 2024 on a weighted average basis, with the slow down driven primarily by our most likely scenario that the u.s. economy enters a mild recession during the year. growth then rises to 1.5% in 2025, before growing to 2.0% in 2026. the weighted average unemployment rate is expected to increase throughout 2024, peaking at 4.7% during the first half of 2025 and gradually improving to 4.2% by the fourth quarter of 2026.
the current state of the economy reflects heightened uncertainty due to structural and secular changes fostered by the pandemic for certain sectors of the economy, such as commercial real estate, combined with inflation, interest rate movements and declining consumer savings and deposit balances. as such, for both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios, pnc identified and performed significant analysis around segments impacted by such uncertainties to ensure our reserves are adequate, given our current macroeconomic expectations.
we believe the economic scenarios effectively reflect the distribution of potential economic outcomes. additionally, through in-depth and granular analysis we have addressed reserve requirements for the specific populations most affected in the current environment. through this approach, we believe the reserve levels adequately reflect the expected credit losses in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date.
to provide additional context regarding the sensitivity of the acl to a more pessimistic forecast of expected economic outcomes, we considered what our acl would be when applying a 100% probability weighting to the most severe downside cecl scenario. this severe downside scenario estimated that real gdp contracted in 2024 ending the year down 2.0% compared to 2023 levels, with the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k growth picking up again by the end of 2025. the unemployment rate in this scenario increased to end 2024 at 6.3%, then peaks at 7.1% in the second half of 2025, before gradually improving to 6.0% by the end of 2026. excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments, this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase in our acl of $1.7 billion at december 31, 2023. this scenario does not reflect our current expectation at december 31, 2023, nor does it capture all the potential unknown variables that could arise in the forecast period, but it provides an approximation of a possible outcome under hypothetical severe conditions. the cecl methodology inherently requires a high degree of judgment, and as a result, it is possible that we may, at another point in time, reach different conclusions regarding our credit loss estimates.
see the following for additional details on the components of our acl:
•allowance for credit losses in the credit risk management section of this item 7, and
•note 1 accounting policies, note 2 investment securities, and note 3 loans and related allowance for credit losses.
residential and commercial mortgage servicing rights we elect to measure our msrs at fair value. this election was made to be consistent with our risk management strategy to hedge changes in the fair value of these assets. the fair value of our msrs is estimated by using a discounted cash flow valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and other factors which are determined based on current market conditions.
we employ risk management strategies designed to protect the value of msrs from changes in interest rates and related market factors. the values of the msrs are economically hedged with securities and derivatives, including interest-rate swaps, options, and forward mortgage-backed and futures contracts. as interest rates change, these financial instruments are expected to have changes in fair value inverse to the change in fair value of the hedged msr portfolios. the hedge relationships are actively managed in response to changing market conditions over the life of the msrs. selecting appropriate financial instruments to economically hedge residential or commercial msrs requires significant management judgment to assess how rates and prepayment speeds could affect the future values of msrs. hedging results can frequently be less predictable in the short term, but over longer periods of time, they are expected to protect the economic value of the msrs.
for information on how each estimate has changed and a sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect of the fair value of msrs to immediate adverse changes in key assumptions, see note 5 goodwill and mortgage servicing rights. for additional information on our residential and commercial msrs, see note 1 accounting policies, note 5 goodwill and mortgage servicing rights and note 14 fair value.
we must use estimates, assumptions and judgments when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. when observable price and third-party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques. changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these valuation techniques could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations.
we apply asc 820 - fair value measurements. this guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. this guidance requires a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. the classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used in the measurement are observable or unobservable. level 3 assets and liabilities are those where the fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs. an asset or liability's classification as level 2 or level 3 is based upon the specific facts and circumstances associated with each instrument, and management applies judgment regarding the significance of unobservable inputs to each asset or liability when determining its fair value level classification. in addition to msrs, certain of our private equity investments and available for sale securities have a high level of estimation uncertainty and require significant management judgment to determine the fair value. while estimating potential sensitivities around fair value measurements is inherently challenging, we provide a summary of the key unobservable inputs as well as additional information on level 3 fair value measurements in note 14 fair value.

the pnc financial services group, inc. - 2023 form 10-k cautionary statement regarding forward-looking information we make statements in this report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook for financial performance, such as earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial position, and other matters regarding or affecting us and our future business and operations, including our sustainability strategy, that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act. forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as "believe," "plan," "expect," "anticipate," "see," "look," "intend," "outlook," "project," "forecast," "estimate," "goal," "will," "should" and other similar words and expressions.
•our businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including:
-changes in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets,
-changes in customer behavior due to changing business and economic conditions or legislative or regulatory initiatives,
-changes in customers', suppliers' and other counterparties' performance and creditworthiness,
-impacts of sanctions, tariffs and other trade policies of the u.s. and its global trading partners,
-impacts of changes in federal, state and local governmental policy, including on the regulatory landscape, capital markets, taxes, infrastructure spending and social programs,
-our ability to attract, recruit and retain skilled employees, and
-commodity price volatility.
•our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies. these statements are based on our views that:
-pnc expects the federal funds rate to remain unchanged in the first part of 2024, between 5.25% and 5.50%, with federal funds rate cuts starting in may 2024 as inflation slows further. pnc expects the federal funds rate to end 2024 between 4.25% and 4.50%.
•pnc's ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to pnc meeting or exceeding an scb established by the federal reserve board in connection with the federal reserve board's ccar process.
•pnc's regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, its financial performance, the scope and terms of final capital regulations then in effect and management actions affecting the composition of pnc's balance sheet. in addition, pnc's ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and regulatory review of related models and the reliability of and risks resulting from extensive use of such models.
•legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, reputation or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding and ability to attract and retain employees. these developments could include:
-results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental agencies.
-costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual property protection in general.
•business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards.
•our reputation and business and operating results may be affected by our ability to appropriately meet or address environmental, social or governance targets, goals, commitments or concerns that may arise.
•we grow our business in part through acquisitions and new strategic initiatives. risks and uncertainties include those presented by the nature of the business acquired and strategic initiative, including in some cases those associated with our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, the integration of the acquired businesses into pnc after closing or any failure to execute strategic or operational plans.
•competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.
•business and operating results can also be affected by widespread manmade, natural and other disasters (including severe weather events), health emergencies, dislocations, geopolitical instabilities or events, terrorist activities, system failures or disruptions, security breaches, cyberattacks, international hostilities, or other extraordinary events beyond pnc's control through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties, customers or third-party vendors and service providers specifically.
we provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in this report, including in item 1a risk factors, the risk management section of item 7 and note 20 legal proceedings. our forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the sec.

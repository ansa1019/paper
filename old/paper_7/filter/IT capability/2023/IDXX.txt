item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10‚Äêk. the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december 31, 2021, and year-over-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021, is included in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, within item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, and is incorporated by reference herein.
we have included certain terms and abbreviations used throughout this annual report on form 10-k in the "glossary of terms and selected abbreviations."
description of business segments. we operate primarily through three business segments: diagnostic and information management-based products and services for the companion animal veterinary industry, which we refer to as the companion animal group ("cag"); water quality products ("water"); and diagnostic products and services for livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and improve producer efficiency, which we refer to as livestock, poultry and dairy ("lpd"). our other operating segment combines and presents our human medical diagnostic products and services business ("opti medical") with our out-licensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. refer to "part ii, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, note 3. revenue and note 17. segment reporting" to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2023, included in this annual report on form 10-k for financial information about our segments, including our product and service categories, and our geographic areas.
the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business.
companion animal group our strategy is to provide veterinarians with the highest quality diagnostic information, software products and services, and medical evidence to support more advanced medical care and information management solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient and effective practice management. by doing so, we are able to build a mutually successful relationship with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets, loyal customers, staff efficiency, and expanding practice revenues.
cag diagnostics. we provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians' diverse needs through a variety of modalities including in-clinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services. veterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patient's diagnostic results, which allows them to track and evaluate trends and achieve greater medical insight.
our diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and non-recurring revenues. revenues related to capital placements of our in-clinic idexx vetlab suite of instruments and our snap pro analyzer are non-recurring in nature in that they are sold to a particular customer only once. revenues from the associated idexx vetlab consumables, snap rapid assay test kits, reference laboratory and consulting services, and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our idexx vetlab instruments, and our snap pro analyzer are recurring in nature, in that they are regularly purchased by our customers, typically as they perform diagnostic testing as part of ongoing veterinary care services. our recurring revenues, most prominently idexx vetlab consumables and rapid assay test kits, have significantly higher gross margins than those provided by our instrument sales. therefore, the sales mix of recurring and non-recurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins.
diagnostic capital revenue. revenues related to the placement of the idexx vetlab suite of instruments are non-recurring in nature, in that the customer will buy an instrument once over its respective product life cycle, but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for diagnostic testing purposes. many instruments are placed through our customer commitment arrangements in exchange for multi-year customer commitments to purchase recurring products and services.
below is a table showing active installed base units of our premium diagnostic instruments as of the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021:
(units in thousands)                                                                                         installed base instrument                              december 31, 2023                december 31, 2022                december 31, 2021
our long-term success in the continuing growth of our cag recurring diagnostic products and services is dependent upon: growing volumes at existing customers by increasing their utilization of existing and new test offerings, acquiring new customers, maintaining high customer loyalty and retention, and realizing annual price increases based on our differentiated products and the growing value of our diagnostic offering. we continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of real-time care testing workflows, which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit. our latest generation of chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use, faster time to results, broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments. in addition, we provide marketing tools and customer support that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis.
with all of our instrument product lines, we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors' products based on time-to-result, ease-of-use, throughput, breadth of diagnostic menu, flexibility of menu selection, accuracy, reliability, ability to handle compromised samples, analytical capability of diagnostics software, integration with the ivls and vetconnect plus, client communications capabilities, education and training, and superior sales and customer service. our success depends, in part, on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price.
recurring diagnostic revenue. revenues from our idexx vetlab consumable products, our snap rapid assay test kits, outside reference laboratory and consulting services, and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our cag diagnostics instruments are considered recurring in nature. for the year ended december 31, 2023, recurring diagnostic revenue, which is both highly durable and profitable, accounted for approximately 80% of our consolidated revenue.
our in-clinic diagnostic solutions, consisting of our idexx vetlab consumable products and snap rapid assay test kits, provide real-time reference lab quality diagnostic results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions. our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with board-certified veterinary specialists and pathologists, combined with the benefit of same-day or next-day turnaround times.
we derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in idexx vetlab instruments, and the multi-year consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument. our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing idexx vetlab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables. utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample. our strategy is to increase both drivers. to increase utilization, we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes, as well as by introducing new testing capabilities that were previously not available to veterinarians.
our in-clinic diagnostic solutions also include snap rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population. we seek to differentiate these tests from those of other in-clinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers based on critically important sensitivity and specificity, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed third-party research, as well as overall superior performance and ease of use by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up to six diseases at once, including the ability to utilize our snap pro analyzer. we further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing.
the prevalence of in-clinic testing, as opposed to outside reference laboratories such as idexx reference laboratories, may vary by region. we attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive in-clinic offerings primarily on the basis of a differentiated test menu, technology employed, quality, turnaround time, customer service and tools such as vetconnect plus that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our in-clinic offerings.
profitability in our lab business is supported, in part, by our expanding business scale globally. profit improvements also reflect benefits from price increases and our ability to achieve operational efficiencies. when possible, we utilize core reference laboratories to service samples from other states or countries, expanding our customer reach without an associated expansion in our reference laboratory footprint. new laboratories may operate at a loss until testing volumes achieve sufficient scale. acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and acquired laboratories may not achieve the profitability of our existing laboratory network for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies. therefore, in the short term, new and acquired reference laboratories generally may have a negative effect on our operating margin.
recurring reference lab revenue growth is achieved both through increased testing volumes with existing customers and through the acquisition of new customers, net of customer losses. we believe the increased number of customer visits by our sales professionals as a result of the growth in our field sales organization has led to increased reference laboratory opportunities with customers who already use one of our in-clinic diagnostic modalities. recurring reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting revenues have also increased as a result of our customer commitment arrangements, and customer gains from reference laboratory acquisitions, customer list acquisitions, and the opening of new reference laboratories, including laboratories that are co-located with large practice customers.
veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems. our portfolio of practice management offerings is designed to serve the full range of customers primarily within the north american, australian, new zealand, and european regions. cornerstone, ezyvet, animana, idexx neo, and dvmax practice management systems provide integrated information solutions, backed by customer support and education. these practice management systems support the veterinarian's ability to practice better medicine and achieve the practice's business objectives, including a quality client experience, staff efficiency and practice effectiveness and profitability. we market cornerstone, ezyvet, idexx neo, and dvmax practice management systems to customers primarily in north america, australia, and new zealand. we market our animana offering to customers primarily throughout europe.
our diagnostic imaging systems offer a convenient radiographic solution that provides superior image quality and the ability to share images with clients virtually anywhere. idexx imaging software enables enhanced diagnostic features and streamlined integration with our other products and services. our digital radiography systems enable low-dose radiation image capture without sacrificing clear, high-quality diagnostic images, reducing the risk posed by excess radiation exposure for veterinary professionals.
recurring revenue. animana, ezyvet, and idexx neo practice management systems are subscription-based saas offerings designed to provide flexible pricing and a durable, recurring revenue stream, while utilizing cloud technology instead of a client server platform. while we continue to support our licensed-based cornerstone and dvmax software, we are growing our installed base of subscription-based practice management offerings for new customers of idexx practice management systems. our cornerstone and dvmax customer base continues to be an important driver of growth through diagnostic integrations and add-on subscription services, such as pet health network pro, petly plans, and credit card processing, and we continue to make investments to enhance the customer experience of all of our license-based software offerings. we also offer rvetlink, a comprehensive referral management solution for specialty care hospitals that streamlines the referral process between primary care and specialty care veterinarians. rvetlink's cloud technology integrates with major specialty hospital management systems, including cornerstone software and dvmax software. our large practice management systems installed base provides access to veterinary channel transaction activity, enabling a syndicated data offering.
with our smartflow and vet radar cloud technology, we are able to improve overall patient management through coordination and tracking of every step in a patient workflow. pet health network pro online client communication and education service complements the entire idexx product offering by educating pet owners and building loyalty through engaging the pet owner before, during and after the visit, thereby building client loyalty and driving more patient visits.
placements of imaging systems are important to the growth of revenue streams that are recurring in nature, including extended maintenance agreements and idexx web pacs, which is our cloud-based saas offering for viewing, accessing, storing, and sharing multi-modality diagnostic images. we derive relatively higher margins from our subscription-based products. idexx web pacs is integrated with cornerstone, ezyvet, idexx neo, dvmax, and idexx vetconnect plus to provide centralized access to diagnostic imaging results alongside patient diagnostic results from any internet connected device.
systems and hardware. we differentiate our practice management systems through enhanced functionality, ease of use, and embedded integration with in-clinic idexx vetlab instruments and outside reference laboratory test results. software, hardware, and integrated services that run key functions of veterinary clinics, including managing patient electronic health records, scheduling, client communication, billing, and inventory management. we also provide installation and advisory services associated with our systems and hardware placements.
our diagnostic imaging systems capture radiographic images in digital form, replacing traditional x-ray film and the film development process, which generally requires the use of hazardous chemicals and darkrooms. we market and sell two diagnostic imaging systems primarily used in small animal veterinary applications: the idexx imagevue dr50 and the idexx imagevue dr30.
water our strategy in the water testing business is to develop, manufacture, market and sell products that test primarily for the presence of microbial contamination in water matrices, including drinking water supplies, with superior performance, supported by exceptional customer service. our customers primarily consist of water utilities, government laboratories and private certified laboratories that highly value strong relationships and customer support. we expect that future growth in this business will be partially dependent on our ability to increase international sales. growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line. most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation, and, in many countries, a test may not be used for compliance testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body and integrated into customers' testing protocols. as a result, we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for a growing number of regulatory approvals in a number of countries, primarily in europe. further, we seek to receive regulatory approvals from governing agencies as a means to differentiate our products from the competition.
livestock, poultry and dairy we develop, manufacture, market, and sell a broad range of tests and perform services for various livestock diseases and conditions, and have active research and development and in-licensing programs in this area. our strategy is to offer differentiated tests with superior performance characteristics for use in government programs to control or eradicate disease and disease outbreaks and in livestock and poultry producers' disease, reproductive, and herd health and production management programs. our alertys ruminant pregnancy test, rapid visual pregnancy test and alertys on-farm pregnancy test for cattle can detect pregnancy 28 days after breeding. these tests provide a quick and accurate identifier using whole blood samples.
disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable, and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time. in response to outbreaks, testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods. conversely, successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products. in addition, increases in government funding may lead to increased demand for certain products and budgetary constraints may lead to decreased demand for certain products. as a result, the performance in certain sectors of this business can fluctuate.
our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop, manufacture and sell antibiotic residue and contaminant testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements or dairy processor standards for testing of milk and provide reliable field performance. the manufacture of these testing products leverages the snap platform and production assets that also support our rapid assay business, which also leverages the snap platform. the dairy snap products incorporate customized reagents for antibiotic and contaminant detection.
other opti medical. our strategy in the opti medical business for the human market is to develop, manufacture, and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers, and related consumable products for the medical point-of-care diagnostics sector worldwide, with a focus on small to mid-sized hospitals. we seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use, convenience, international distribution and service and instrument reliability. similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy, a substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers.
beginning in 2020, with the onset of the covid-19 pandemic, we provided human testing solutions for the detection of sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19. during the first quarter of 2023, we discontinued actively marketing our covid-19 testing products and services.
our facility in roswell, georgia develops and manufactures the opti product lines using the same or similar technology to support the electrolyte requirements of certain cag products. we leverage this facility's know-how, intellectual property, and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the vetstat and catalyst platforms for veterinary applications, while reducing our cost of consumables by leveraging experience and economies of scale.
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates. refer to "part ii, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, note 2. summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for a description of the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements.
we believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change.
revenue recognition refer to "part ii, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, note 3. revenue" to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2023, included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue.
we enter into contracts where customers purchase combinations of idexx products and services. determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately requires judgment. we determine the transaction price for a contract based on the total consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the transferred goods or services. to the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, such as volume rebates or expected price adjustments, we apply judgment in constraining the estimated variable consideration due to factors that may cause reversal of revenue recognized. we evaluate constraints based on our historical and projected experience with similar customer contracts.
we allocate revenue to each performance obligation in proportion to the relative standalone selling prices and recognize revenue when control of the related goods or services is transferred for each obligation. we utilize the observable standalone selling price when available, which represents the price charged for the promised product or service when sold separately. when standalone selling prices for our products or services are not directly observable, we determine the standalone selling prices using relevant information available and apply suitable estimation methods including, but not limited to, the cost plus a margin approach.
our customer commitment arrangements that include free or discounted instruments and systems, such as our idexx 360 program, provide customers with free or discounted instruments or systems upon entering into multi-year arrangements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products and services. we allocate total consideration, including future committed purchases and expected price adjustments, based on relative standalone selling prices, to identified performance obligations and recognize instrument revenue and cost at the time of installation and customer acceptance in advance of billing the customer, which is also when the customer obtains control of the instrument based on legal title transfer. our right to future consideration related to instrument revenue is recorded as a contract asset within other current and long-term assets. the contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when customers are billed for products and services over the term of the arrangement. we estimate, based on historical experience, and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases and expected price adjustments related to these multi-year arrangements. differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition during the term of the customer arrangement, and a 10% change in these estimates would have increased or reduced contract assets and cumulative recognized revenue related to these programs by approximately $5.5 million at december 31, 2023.
our customer commitment arrangements that include up-front consideration paid to customers provide customers with incentives in the form of idexx points or, from time to time, cash, upon entering into multi-year arrangements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services. if a customer breaches their agreement, they are required to refund all or a portion of the up-front consideration, or make other repayments, remedial actions, or both. up-front incentives to customers are not made in exchange for distinct goods or services and are capitalized as consideration paid to customers (previously referred to as "customer acquisition costs") within other current and long-term assets, which are subsequently recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer arrangement. if these up-front incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase instruments, we allocate total consideration, including future committed purchases less up-front incentives and estimates of expected price adjustments, based on relative standalone selling prices, to identified performance obligations and recognize instrument revenue and cost at the time of installation and customer acceptance. we estimate, based on historical experience, and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases and expected price adjustments related to these multi-year arrangements. differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition during the term of the customer arrangement, and a 10% change in these estimates would have increased or reduced cumulative recognized revenue related to these programs by approximately $1.3 million at december 31, 2023.
our rebate arrangements provide customers the opportunity to earn future rebates based on the volume of products and services they purchase over the term of the arrangement. we account for the customer's right to earn rebates on future purchases as a separate performance obligation and determine the standalone selling price based on an estimate of rebates the customer will earn over the term of the program. total consideration allocated to identified performance obligations is limited to goods and services that the customer is presently obligated to purchase and does not include estimates of future purchases that are optional. we allocate total consideration to identified performance obligations, including the customer's right to earn rebates on future purchases, which is deferred and subsequently recognized upon the purchase of products and services, partly offsetting rebates as they are earned. we estimate, based on historical experience, and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer rebates related to these multi-year arrangements. differences between estimated and actual customer rebates may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition during the term of the customer arrangement, and a 10% change in these estimates would have increased or reduced deferred revenue and cumulative recognized revenue related to these programs by approximately $0.1 million at december 31, 2023.
future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods compared to reductions in the current or prior periods. additionally, certain customer arrangements require us to estimate, based on historical experience, and apply judgment to predict the amounts of future customer purchases, customer rebates and other incentive payments, and price adjustments related to multi-year arrangements. differences between estimated and actual customer purchases may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition as described above.
income taxes the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. under this approach, deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable.
we assess our current and projected earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits. should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in a particular jurisdiction in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
for those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more likely than not, a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction. in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made. likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged against income in the period such determination was made.
our net taxable temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized. should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future, an adjustment to our deferred taxes would be credited or charged, as appropriate, to income in the period such determination was made.
we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies. any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such determination was made.
we record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting. we record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained. for positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail, we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement. if our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes, if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires, the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change, resolution or expiration occurs. our net liability for uncertain tax positions was $25.0 million as of december 31, 2023, and $25.8 million as of december 31, 2022, which includes estimated interest expense and penalties. refer to "part ii, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, note 14. income taxes" in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.
recent accounting pronouncements refer to "part ii, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, note 2. summary of significant accounting policies (v) and (w)" to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2023, included in this annual report on form 10-k for a complete discussion of recent accounting pronouncements adopted and not adopted.
results of operations and trends effects of certain factors on results of operations cag trends. global trends in companion animal healthcare, including growth in demand for clinical services, continue to support solid growth for companion animal diagnostic products and services across regions. in the u.s., average diagnostics revenue per practice grew approximately 8% on a same-store basis during 2023, faster than approximately 6% growth in overall clinic revenues. u.s. same-store clinical visits at veterinary practices declined approximately 0.5% in 2023, impacted by ongoing veterinary practice productivity and capacity constraints. our products and services include solutions that help improve staff productivity and create additional capacity at veterinary clinics. for example, during january 2024, we announced the launch of our new slide-free cellular analyzer, idexx invue dx, that detects the most common cytologic changes found in ear and blood samples, targeted for late 2024 release.
supply chain and logistics challenges. we believe that building and maintaining a well-managed and disciplined infrastructure have helped minimize impacts of supply chain constraints, including product and component availability issues, logistics challenges, including extended shipping periods and delays, and inflationary pressures. our proactive approach to managing our operational processes, including forward planning with a focus on working closely with our suppliers and logistics partners, enables us to maintain continued high levels of product and service availability and customer service. we believe we are well-positioned to enable sustained high growth in our businesses and to effectively manage the impacts of potentially relatively higher costs in certain areas to support these growth plans. however, there can be no assurance as to the duration or severity of the supply chain and logistics challenges or the effectiveness of our mitigating activities.
effect of geopolitical conflicts. the overall financial performance of our business may be impacted by geopolitical instability and macroeconomic conditions, including the effects of conflicts between russia and ukraine, tensions across the taiwan strait, the israel-hamas conflict, as well as other conflicts in the middle east, and resulting uncertainty in the markets, volatility in exchange rates, and inflationary trends. in june 2022 we decided to liquidate our sole russian subsidiary and suspend our direct russian operations, which consisted of marketing and selling diagnostic products for veterinary clinics in russia. a limited number of our products, which are important for human or animal healthcare, continue to be sold in russia pursuant to ongoing third-party distribution agreements. suspending our direct russian operations and liquidating our russian subsidiary did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
currency impact. for the year ended december 31, 2023, approximately 21% of our consolidated revenue was derived from products manufactured or sourced in u.s. dollars and sold internationally in local currencies, compared to 21% for the year ended december 31, 2022, and 23% for the year ended december 31, 2021. strengthening of the rate of exchange for the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the u.s. dollar and on profits of products manufactured or purchased in u.s. dollars and sold internationally, and a weakening of the u.s. dollar has the opposite effect. similarly, to the extent that the u.s. dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods, our growth rate will be negatively affected. the impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offsets this exposure. additionally, our designated hedges of intercompany inventory purchases and sales help delay the impact of certain exchange rate fluctuations on non-u.s. denominated revenues. refer to "part ii, item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding currency impact. our future income tax expense could also be affected by changes in the mix of earnings, including as a result of changes in the rate of exchange for the u.s. dollar relative to currencies in countries with differing statutory tax rates. refer to "part i, item 1a. risk factors" included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding tax impacts.
effects of economic conditions. demand for our products and services is vulnerable to changes in the economic environment, including slow economic growth, high unemployment, and credit availability. negative or cautious consumer sentiment can lead to reduced or delayed consumer spending, resulting in a decreased number of patient visits to veterinary clinics. unfavorable economic conditions can impact sales of instruments, diagnostic imaging, and practice management systems, which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians. additionally, economic turmoil, fears of a global economic downturn or recession, and inflationary pressure can cause our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services. in the u.s., we monitor patient visits and clinic revenue data provided by a subset of our cag customers. although this data is a limited sample, and may be susceptible to short-term impacts, we believe that this data provides a fair and meaningful long-term representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the u.s., providing us insight regarding demand for our products and services.
economic conditions can also affect the purchasing decisions of our water and lpd business customers. water testing volumes may be susceptible to declines in discretionary testing for existing home and commercial sales and in mandated testing as a result of decreases in home and commercial construction. in addition, fiscal difficulties can also reduce government funding for water and herd health screening services.
we believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our customers partially mitigate the potential effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates.
distributor purchasing and inventories. when selling our products through distributors, changes in distributors' inventory levels can impact our reported sales, and these changes may be affected by many factors, which may not be directly related to underlying demand for our products by veterinary practices, which are the end users. if during a quarter or year, distributors' inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year, then changes in distributors' inventories would have an unfavorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period. conversely, if during a quarter or year, distributors' inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year, then changes in distributors' inventories would have a favorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period.
in certain countries, we sell our products through third-party distributors and may be unable to obtain data for sales to end users. we do not believe the impact of changes in these distributors' inventories had or would have a material impact on our growth rates. refer to "part i, item 1. business, marketing and distribution" included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding distribution channels.
effects of patent expiration. although we have several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties that expired during 2023, and several that are expected to expire in 2024 and beyond, the expiration of these patents or licenses, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or future operations due to a range of factors as described in "part i, item 1. business, patents and licenses."
non-gaap financial measures. the following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth, and references in this analysis and discussion to "revenue," "revenues" or "revenue growth" are references to "organic revenue growth." organic revenue growth is a non-gaap financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the current year, compared to the same period for the prior year, net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, certain business acquisitions, and divestitures. organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for, or as a superior measure to, revenues reported in accordance with u.s. gaap, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers.
we exclude from organic revenue growth the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management's control, are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. we calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the comparable prior year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the prior year period.
we also exclude from organic revenue growth the effect of certain business acquisitions and divestitures because the nature, size and number of these transactions can vary dramatically from period to period, and because they either require or generate cash as an inherent consequence of the transaction, and therefore can also obscure underlying business and operating trends. we consider acquisitions to be a business when all three elements of inputs, processes and outputs are present, consistent with asu 2017-01, "business combinations: (topic 805) clarifying the definition of a business." in a business combination, if substantially all the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, we do not consider these assets to be a business. a typical acquisition that we do not consider a business is a customer list asset acquisition, which does not have all elements necessary to operate a business, such as employees or infrastructure. we believe the efforts required to convert and retain these acquired customers are similar in nature to our existing customer base and therefore are included in organic revenue growth.
we also use adjusted ebitda, gross debt, net debt, gross debt to adjusted ebitda ratio and net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio, all of which are non-gaap financial measures that should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for, financial measures presented according to u.s. gaap. management believes that reporting these non-gaap financial measures provides supplemental analysis to help investors further evaluate our business performance and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility.
comparisons to prior periods. our fiscal years end on december 31. unless otherwise stated, the analysis and discussion of our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, including references to growth and organic growth and increases and decreases, are being compared to the equivalent prior year period.

total company revenue. the increase in organic revenue reflects benefits from higher realized prices and continued demand for companion animal diagnostics globally, supported by increases in cag diagnostics recurring revenues. increases in our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging services recurring revenue also contributed to higher revenue supported by demand for subscription-based software. higher revenue in our water business was primarily due to the benefit of price increases and higher testing volumes in certain international regions, as well as the benefit of an acquisition in the third quarter of 2022. the decline in our lpd business was primarily due to lower herd health screening volume, partially offset by higher realized prices and volume growth in north america, europe, and south america. the decrease in other revenue was primarily due to lower sales of opti covid-19 pcr testing products and services, following the discontinuation of active marketing of such products and services in the first quarter of 2023.the impact of currency movements decreased total revenue growth by 0.2%, while the impact of acquisitions increased total revenue growth by 0.1%.

revenue. the decline in revenue was primarily due to lower herd health screening revenues related to reduced live animal imports by china, partially offset by higher realized prices and, to a lesser extent, higher volume in swine, poultry, and ruminant testing in north america, europe, and south america. the impact of foreign currency movements was immaterial to revenue.
gross profit. the decrease in lpd gross profit was primarily due to lower sales volumes and a 570 basis point decrease in the gross profit margin. the impact from foreign currency movements decreased the gross profit margin by approximately 460 basis points, including the impact of lower hedge gains in the current year compared to the prior year. the remaining decrease in the gross profit margin is primarily due to higher product costs and unfavorable sales mix, partially offset by higher realized prices.
operating expenses. sales and marketing expense increased primarily due to increases in personnel-related costs. general and administrative and research and development expenses were relatively constant compared to the prior year. the overall change in foreign currency exchange rates was not significant to operating expense growth.

revenue. the decrease in other revenue was primarily due to lower sales of opti covid-19 pcr testing products and services in the u.s., following our discontinuation of active marketing of such products and services in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by higher realized prices for our opti medical instruments and consumables.
gross profit. gross profit decreased due to lower sales volume and a 1,680 basis point decrease in the gross profit margin. the decrease in the gross profit margin was primarily due to higher product costs and unfavorable sales mix impacts from lower opti covid-19 pcr testing volumes, partially offset by higher realized prices. the overall change in foreign currency exchange rates had an immaterial impact on gross profit.
operating expenses. general and administrative expense decreased primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses on settlements of foreign currency denominated transactions compared to the prior year. foreign exchange losses on settlements for all operating segments are reported within our other segment. research and development expense decreased primarily due to lower product development costs related to human medical diagnostic products.
non-operating items interest expense. interest expense was $41.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to $39.9 million for the prior year. the increase in interest expense was primarily the result of higher interest rates, partially offset by lower average debt balances. during the first quarter of 2023, we entered into an interest rate swap to manage the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with $250.0 million of borrowings under our variable-rate credit facility.
our effective income tax rate was 20.4% for the year ended december 31, 2023, and 21.0% for the year ended december 31, 2022. the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the release of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in certain international and state jurisdictions. our projected effective tax rate for 2024 is approximately 22%. this projected increase in the effective tax rate over the full year 2023 effective tax rate, is primarily due to the non-recurring reductions in our december 31, 2023, effective tax rate associated with the release of valuation allowances.
liquidity and capital resources we fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand, funds generated from operations, proceeds from long-term senior note financings, and amounts available under our credit facility. we generate cash primarily through the payments made by customers for our companion animal veterinary, livestock, poultry, dairy, and water products and services, consulting services, and other various systems and services. our cash disbursements are primarily related to compensation and benefits for our employees, inventory and supplies, taxes, research and development, capital expenditures, rents, occupancy-related charges, interest expense, and business acquisitions. at december 31, 2023, we had $453.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, compared to $112.5 million on december 31, 2022. working capital totaled $543.7 million at december 31, 2023, compared to negative $134.3 million at december 31, 2022. the change in working capital is primarily due to higher cash and lower outstanding borrowings on our credit facility. as of december 31, 2023, we had a remaining borrowing availability of $998.5 million under our $1.25 billion credit facility with $250.0 million outstanding borrowing under the credit facility. the general availability of funds under our credit facility is reduced by $1.5 million for outstanding letters of credit. we believe that, if necessary, we could obtain additional borrowings to fund our growth objectives. we further believe that current cash and cash equivalents, funds generated from operations, and committed borrowing availability will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital purchase requirements, and anticipated growth needs for the next twelve months. we believe that these resources, coupled with our ability, as needed, to obtain additional financing, will also be sufficient to fund our business as currently conducted for the foreseeable future. we may enter into new financing arrangements or refinance or retire existing debt in the future depending on market conditions. should we require more capital in the u.s. than is generated by our operations, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, we could elect to raise capital in the u.s. through the incurrence of debt or equity issuances, which we may not be able to complete on favorable terms or at all. in addition, these alternatives could result in increased interest expense or other dilution of our earnings.
we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries. our foreign cash and cash equivalents are generally available without restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the u.s.

of the $453.9 million of cash and cash equivalents held as of december 31, 2023, $163.1 million was held as bank deposits at a diversified group of institutions, primarily systemically important banks, and $290.8 million was held in a u.s. government money market fund. as of december 31, 2022, more than 99% of the cash and cash equivalents held was as bank deposits. cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2023, included approximately usd $1.7 million in cash denominated in non-u.s. currencies held in countries with currency control restrictions, which limit our ability to transfer funds outside of the countries in which they are held. the currency control restricted cash is generally available for use within the country where it is held.

operating activities. the increase in cash provided by operating activities of $363.5 million during 2023 compared to 2022, was primarily due to comparably less cash used to fund changes in other assets and liabilities, inventories, and higher net income. during the prior year, we entered into two discrete arrangements to license intellectual property for which we paid $65 million which was charged to research and development expense. we also made higher tax payments during 2022, primarily due to changes imposed by the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act, including the relevant provision that requires u.s. research and development expenditures incurred after january 1, 2022 to be capitalized and amortized over a five-year period.
the following table presents cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities:

cash used due to changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to the same period in the prior year, decreased approximately $201.1 million. cash used for inventory in the current period, compared to the prior period, decreased $93.1 million primarily due to planned inventory growth in the prior year to mitigate supply chain risks and support demand. the decrease of cash used for other assets and liabilities was primarily due to higher non-cash operating expenses recorded as accrued liabilities for personnel-related costs and lower annual employee incentive program payments in the current year, and lower tax payments in the current year, compared to the same period in the prior year.
we have historically experienced proportionally lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period driven primarily by payments related to annual employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which the bonuses were earned.
investing activities. cash used by investing activities was $125.3 million during 2023, compared to $195.4 million used during 2022. the decrease in cash used by investing activities during 2023, compared to 2022 was primarily due to discrete uses of cash during the prior year for an equity investment, higher spending for purchases of property and equipment related to our new warehouse and manufacturing site expansion, and for the acquisitions of an international water testing business and intangible assets.
our total capital expenditure plan for 2024 is estimated to be approximately $180.0 million, which includes capital investments in manufacturing and operations facilities to support growth, as well as investments in customer-facing software.
on february 1, 2024, we acquired the assets of a privately owned software and data platform business based in the u.s. that extends our practice management systems cloud-native workflow and delivers strategic data solutions to our customers and their clients for approximately $77 million in cash, and also agreed to make contingent payments of up to $30 million during the subsequent three years, based on the achievement of certain goals.
financing activities. cash used by financing activities was $442.0 million during 2023, compared to $370.9 million used during 2022. the increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to $329.0 million cash used for repayments under our credit facility in the current year, compared to borrowings of $505.5 million under our credit facility in the prior year. the increase in cash used by financing activities was partially offset by $71.9 million of cash used to repurchase our common stock in the current year, compared to $819.7 million of cash used to purchase our common stock in the prior year. in december 2023, we paid off our $75.0 million 2023 series a notes. in february 2022, we paid off our $75.0 million 2022 series a notes.
the aggregate principal amounts of our 2024 series b notes will become due and payable on july 21, 2024 and we anticipate paying off our 2024 series b notes for $75.0 million when due in july 2024 with available cash on hand. should we elect to prepay any of our senior notes, such aggregate prepayment will include the applicable make-whole amount(s), as defined within the applicable senior note agreements. additionally, in the event of a change in control of the company or upon the disposition of certain assets of the company, the proceeds of which are not reinvested (as defined in the senior note agreements), we may be required to prepay all or a portion of the senior notes.
repurchases of our common stock vary depending upon the level of other investing and deployment activities, as well as share price and prevailing interest rates. we believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our stockholders, and we also repurchase our stock to offset the dilutive effect of our share-based compensation programs. we primarily fund our share repurchases with cash generated from operations, as well as from various capital market activities, including the committed available financing through our credit facility. cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock decreased by $747.8 million during 2023, compared to 2022. refer to "part ii, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, note 20. repurchases of common stock" to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information about our share repurchases.
under the $1.25 billion credit facility, the $1.0 billion unsecured credit line matures on december 9, 2026 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date. on october 20, 2022, pursuant to the terms of the credit facility, the term lenders thereunder provided us, as borrower, an incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million (the "term loan"). the term loan matures on october 20, 2025. the net proceeds of the term loan were used to repay previously incurred revolver borrowings under the credit facility. the term loan is subject to the same affirmative and negative covenants and events of default as the borrowings previously incurred pursuant to the credit facility. the applicable interest rate for the term loan is consistent with our line of credit, and is calculated at a per annum rate equal to either (at our option) (1) a prime rate plus a margin ranging from 0.0% to 0.375% based on our consolidated leverage ratio, (2) an adjusted term sofr rate, plus 0.10%, plus a margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.375% based on our consolidated leverage ratio, or (3) an adjusted daily simple sofr rate, plus 0.10%, plus a margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.375% based on our consolidated leverage ratio. refer to "part ii, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, note 13, debt" for additional information about our applicable interest rates on our credit facility. under the credit facility, we also pay quarterly commitment fees ranging from 0.075% to 0.25%, based on our leverage ratio, on any unused commitment.
under the credit facility, the net repayment and borrowing activity resulted in increased cash used of $834.5 million during 2023, compared to 2022. at december 31, 2023, we had $250.0 million outstanding on our line of credit, all of which was on our $250.0 million term loan under the credit facility. at december 31, 2022, we had $329.0 million outstanding on our line of credit and a $250.0 million term loan, for a total of $579.0 million outstanding under the credit facility. the general availability of funds under the credit facility was further reduced by $1.5 million for letters of credit that were issued primarily in connection with our workers' compensation policy at december 31, 2023, and 2022. the credit facility contains affirmative, negative, and financial covenants customary for financings of this type. the negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of subsidiaries of the company, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with affiliates, and certain restrictive agreements and violations of laws and regulations. the financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation not to exceed 3.5-to-1. at december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility. the obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility, which includes customary events of default including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the employee retirement income security act of 1974, ("erisa"), the failure to pay specified indebtedness, cross-acceleration to specified indebtedness and a change of control default.
the obligations under the senior notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the applicable senior note agreements, each of which includes customary events of default including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency-related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under erisa, the failure to pay specified indebtedness, and cross-acceleration to specified indebtedness.
refer to "part ii, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, note 13, debt" for additional information about our credit facility, senior notes, and senior note agreements.
effect of currency translation on cash. the net effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are related to changes in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries. these changes will fluctuate each year as the value of the u.s. dollar relative to the value of the foreign currencies change. the value of a currency depends on many factors, including interest rates, and the issuing governments' debt levels and strength of economy.
off-balance sheet arrangements. we have no off-balance sheet arrangements or variable interest entities except for letters of credit and third-party guarantees, as reflected in "part ii, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, note 13 debt" and "part ii, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. note 16. commitments, contingencies and guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2023, included in this annual report on form 10-k, respectively.
financial covenant. the financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation, as defined in the senior note agreements and credit facility, not to exceed 3.5-to-1. as of december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the covenants of the senior note agreements and credit facility. the following details our consolidated leverage ratio calculation:

we also have purchase obligations that include agreements and purchase orders to purchase goods or services that are contractually enforceable and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities, pricing, and approximate timing of purchases. as of december 31, 2023, we had approximately $196.3 million in purchase obligations due in 2024. our purchase obligations beyond 2024 are approximately $55.2 million. these purchase obligation amounts do not include amounts recorded in accounts payable as of december 31, 2023. the expected timing of payments of our purchase obligations is estimated based on current information. timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.
additionally, we have agreements with third parties that we have entered into in the ordinary course of business under which we are obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses. the precise terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement. in many cases, we limit the maximum amount of our indemnification obligations, but in some cases those obligations may be theoretically unlimited. we have not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these indemnification obligations and, based on our analysis of the nature of the risks involved, we believe that the fair value of these agreements is minimal. accordingly, we did not record any liabilities for these obligations at december 31, 2023 and 2022, and do not anticipate any future payments for these guarantees.
as of december 31, 2023, our remaining obligation associated with the deemed repatriation tax resulting from the tax cut and jobs act of 2017 is $21.8 million. prior to 2023, our prior overpayments satisfied our installment obligations. in 2023, our installment obligation exceeded our remaining overpayment and payment was remitted for the balance due on the installment. our final installment will be paid in 2025. for information on our unrecognized tax benefits, refer to "part ii, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, note 14. income taxes."

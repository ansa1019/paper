item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons. see the factors set forth under the heading "forward looking statements" at the beginning of part 1 of this annual report and in item 1(a) under the heading "risk factors." for discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2022 compared to 2021 refer to part ii, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our 2022 annual report on form 10-k, which was filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission on february 2, 2023.

recent developments acquisition of black knight, inc.
on september 5, 2023, we acquired black knight, inc., or black knight, a software, data and analytics company that serves the housing finance continuum, including real estate data, mortgage lending and servicing, as well as the secondary markets. pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger, dated as of may 4, 2022, among ice, sand merger sub corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of ice, or sub, and black knight, which we refer to as the "merger agreement," sub merged with and into black knight, which we refer to as the "merger," with black knight surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of ice.
the aggregate transaction consideration was approximately $11.8 billion, or $76 per share of black knight common stock, with cash comprising 90% of the value of the aggregate transaction consideration and shares of our common stock comprising 10% of the value of the aggregate transaction consideration. the aggregate cash component of the transaction consideration was $10.5 billion, and the number of our shares issued was based on the market price of our common stock and the average of the volume weighted averages of the trading prices of our common stock on each of the ten consecutive trading days ending three trading days prior to the closing of the merger. we expect that this transaction will build on our position as a provider of end-to-end electronic workflow solutions for the rapidly evolving u.s. residential mortgage industry. we believe the black knight ecosystem adds value for clients of all sizes across the mortgage and real estate lifecycles by helping organizations lower costs, increase efficiencies, grow their businesses, and reduce risk.
on september 14, 2023, or the divestiture date, in connection with the merger agreement, we sold black knight's optimal blue and empower loan origination system, or los, businesses, or the divestitures, to subsidiaries of constellation software, inc. the cash proceeds from the divestitures were $241 million. the structure of the optimal blue transaction also included a promissory note with a face value of $500 million issued by the purchaser to black knight, as a subsidiary of ice, at the closing of the transaction. as described in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, the promissory note was valued at $235 million on the divestiture date. pursuant to the agreement containing consent orders entered into between the ftc and ice and black knight, the promissory note was required to be sold within six months of the divestiture date. on february 7, 2024, the ftc approved the buyer of the promissory note and the proceeds of the promissory note sale will be paid to black knight in the near future. as we elected the fair value option for the promissory note, we are required to mark the asset to fair value each reporting period. for subsequent measurement as of december 31, 2023, we wrote down the value of the promissory note, resulting in a fair value loss of $160 million.
global market conditions our results of operations are affected by global economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical events or conflicts. since 2022, macroeconomic conditions, including rising interest rates, inflation and significant market volatility, along with geopolitical concerns, including the conflicts in ukraine, israel and gaza, have created ongoing uncertainty and volatility in the global economy and resulted in a dynamic operating environment.
our business has been impacted positively and negatively by these global economic conditions. for instance, due to market volatility and rising interest rates, we have seen increased trading across a number of our products, such as interest rate and equity futures, credit default swaps and bonds. conversely, increases in mortgage interest rates in 2022 and 2023 have resulted in reduced consumer and investor demand for mortgages and adversely impacted the transaction-based revenues in our mortgage technology segment. if mortgage rates remain high or further increase, or if banks change their mortgage lending practices, our mortgage technology segment revenues may be further impacted.
from an operational perspective, our businesses, including our exchanges, clearing houses, listings venues, data services businesses and mortgage platforms, have not suffered a material negative impact as a result of these events in ukraine, israel, gaza and surrounding regions.
we expect the macroeconomic environment to remain dynamic in the near-term, and we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, the inflationary environment, geopolitical events and military conflicts, including repercussions from the conflicts in ukraine, israel and gaza and the impact that any of the foregoing may have on the global economy and on our business. throughout 2023, we have closely monitored the credit worthiness of our counterparties and investment agents during the recent banking sector events, scrutinized counterparties directly impacted and monitored for any potential contagion. we did not suffer any material negative impact from the banking sector events that occurred in early 2023. in light of the current and expected macroeconomic environment we will continue to closely monitor credit worthiness of our counterparties, clearing members and our financial service providers and take risk management measures in line with established risk management frameworks.
tax policy changes the organisation for economic cooperation and development, or oecd, global anti-base erosion pillar two minimum tax rules, or pillar two, which generally provide for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, are intended to apply to tax years beginning in 2024. in 2023, the oecd issued administrative guidance providing transitional safe harbor rules concerning the implementation of the pillar two framework, which will apply to fiscal years ending on or before december 31, 2026. the eu member states and many other countries, including the u.k., have committed to implement or have already enacted legislation adopting the pillar two rules. we are monitoring developments and evaluating the impacts of these new rules on our tax rate, including our ability to qualify for the safe harbor rules as implemented by each jurisdiction, however, we do not expect a material impact to our effective tax rate given our current tax profile.
consolidated financial highlights the following summarizes our results and significant changes in our consolidated financial performance for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):
(1) operating income/(loss) from our mortgage technology segment was ($276 million) and $57 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
(2) the adjusted figures exclude items that are not reflective of our ongoing core operations and business performance. adjusted net income attributable to ice is presented net of taxes. these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap. see "-non-gaap financial measures" below.

*percentage changes in the table above deemed "n/a" are not meaningful.
(1) we define recurring revenues as the portion of our revenues that are generally predictable, stable, and can be expected to occur at regular intervals in the future with a relatively high degree of certainty and visibility. we define transaction revenues as those associated with a more specific point-in-time service, such as a trade execution.
(2) the adjusted figures exclude items that are not reflective of our ongoing core operations and business performance. adjusted net income attributable to ice and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ice common stockholders are presented net of taxes. these adjusted figures are not calculated in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap. see "- non-gaap financial measures" below.
(3) we believe these non-gaap liquidity measures provide useful information to management and investors to analyze cash resources generated from our operations. we believe that free cash flow is useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors and demonstrates our ability to convert the reinvestment of capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs required to maintain and grow our business. we believe that adjusted free cash flow eliminates the impact of timing differences related to the payment of section 31 fees. these figures are not calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap. see "-non-gaap liquidity measures" below.
•revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $696 million in 2023 from 2022. the increase in revenues includes $17 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from fluctuations in the u.s. dollar in 2023 as compared to 2022.
•revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $146 million in 2022 from 2021. the increase in revenues includes $115 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from fluctuations in the u.s. dollar in 2022 as compared to 2021.

•the 16% effective tax rate in 2023 was below the u.s. corporate income tax rate primarily driven by the following factors: favorable audit settlements for historical years, favorable state apportionment changes, and the application of the high-tax exception to global intangible low-taxed income. these benefits were partially offset by the impact of the u.k. corporate income tax increase from 19% to 25% effective april 1, 2023, and the tax impact of certain non-deductible black knight acquisition costs.
•the 17% effective tax rate in 2022 was below the u.s. corporate income tax rate primarily driven by the deferred income tax benefit from the impairment of our equity method investment in bakkt.
•the 29% effective tax rate in 2021 is significantly above the u.s corporate income tax rate primarily due to the deferred income tax expense resulting from the u.k. tax law changes enacted in 2021. in 2021, the u.k. enacted a corporate income tax rate increase from 19% to 25% effective april 1, 2023.
business environment and market trends our business environment has been characterized by:
•globalization of marketplaces, customers and competitors;
•growing customer demand for workflow efficiency and automation;
•commodity, interest rate, inflation rate and financial markets volatility and uncertainty;
•growing demand for data to inform customers' risk management and investment decisions;
•price volatility increasing customers' demand for risk management services;
•increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies;
•customers' preference to manage risk in markets demonstrating the greatest depth of liquidity and product diversity;
•the evolution of existing products and new product innovation to serve emerging customer needs and changing industry agreements;
•rising demand for speed, data, data capacity and connectivity by market participants, necessitating increased investment in technology; and
•consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings.
recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. however, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered. in addition, some of the global regulations have not been fully harmonized and several non-u.s. regulations are inconsistent with u.s. rules. as the evolution continues, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. as a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. as discussed more fully in item 1 "- business - regulation" included in this annual report, brexit, mifid ii and other regulations have resulted in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.
we have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or transaction activity in any one asset class. in addition, we have increased our portion of recurring revenues from 34% in 2014 to 52% in 2023. these recurring revenues include data services, listings and various mortgage technology solutions.
many of the data products we sell and services we provide are required for our clients' business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. we anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following:
•increasing global regulatory demands;
•greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations;
•greater emphasis on risk management;
•market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes;
•ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets;
•increased automation of fixed income, mortgage and other less automated markets;
•the development of new data products;
•the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity;
•increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions.
we continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, and prudently manage expenses, in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing, markets and technology solutions.
segment results our business is conducted through three reportable business segments: exchanges, fixed income and data services and mortgage technology. segments are discussed more in detail in "item 1- business". while revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of more than one segment. we directly allocate expenses when reasonably possible to do so. otherwise, we use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment and serve functions that are necessary for the operation of all segments. our segments do not engage in intersegment transactions.

(1) transaction-based expenses are largely attributable to our cash equities and options business.
exchanges revenues our exchanges segment includes transaction and clearing revenues from our futures and nyse exchanges, related data and connectivity services, and our listings business. transaction and clearing revenues consist of fees collected from derivatives, cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing, and are reported on a net basis, except for the nyse transaction-based expenses discussed below. rates per-contract, or rpc, are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions.
transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis and revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and product mix. we consider data and connectivity services revenues and listings revenues to be recurring revenues. our data and connectivity services revenues are recurring subscription fees related to the various data and connectivity services that we provide which are directly attributable to our exchange venues. our listings revenues are also recurring subscription fees that we earn for the provision of nyse listings services for public companies and etfs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.
in 2023 and 2022, 20% and 18%, respectively, of our exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro compared to the u.s. dollar, our exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were higher by $14 million in 2023 from 2022.
our exchange transaction and clearing revenues are presented net of rebates. we recorded rebates of $989 million and $869 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. we offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. the increase in rebates is primarily due to higher volumes traded as compared to 2022.
•energy futures and options: total energy volume increased 17% and revenues increased 29% in 2023 from 2022.
-total oil futures and options volume increased 19% in 2023 from 2022 driven, in part, by price volatility related to oil supply/demand dynamics and geopolitical risk, coupled with increased focus on brent with midland wti now deliverable into the brent basket, providing additional physical liquidity and exposure.

-interest rate futures and options volume increased 4% and revenue increased 2% in 2023 from 2022 driven by interest rate volatility and speculation regarding central bank activity in late 2023. interest rate futures and options revenues were $299 million and $292 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
-other financial futures and options volume, which includes our msci®, ftse® and nyse fang+ equity index products, decreased 15% and revenue decreased 12% in 2023 from 2022. other financial futures and options volume decreased as 2022 benefited from elevated volatility across global equity markets driven by geopolitical events, central bank activity and inflationary concerns. other financial futures and options revenues were $161 million and $183 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
•cash equities and equity options: cash equities volume decreased 7% in 2023 from 2022 due to lower total market volumes as 2022 benefited from elevated volatility related to inflationary, recessionary and geopolitical concerns. cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $268 million and $275 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. equity options volume increased 4% in 2023 from 2022 driven by increased participation. equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $115 million and $103 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
•otc and other: otc and other transactions include revenues from our otc energy business and other trade confirmation services, as well as interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our u.s. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. our otc and other revenues decreased 7% in 2023 from 2022 primarily due to a decrease in interest income on clearing margin deposits.
•data and connectivity services: our data and connectivity services revenues increased 6% in 2023 from 2022. the increase in revenue was driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers and increased purchases by existing customers.
•listings revenues: through nyse, nyse american and nyse arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and etfs, and related corporate actions for listed companies. listings revenues decreased 4% in 2023 from 2022, driven by market volatility causing delays in initial public offerings, or ipos.
listings revenues in our securities markets arise from fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges- original listing fees and annual listing fees. original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to corporate actions. initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. all listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time. revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over the period these services are provided, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges.
in addition, we earn corporate actions-related listing fees in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions.
listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges.
additionally, in 2023, nyse reported 32 listing transfers from competing exchanges, the second-highest total since 2002, bringing $120 billion in new market capitalization to the exchange and also listed two of the year's three largest ipos.
selected operating data volume of contracts traded, futures and options rate per contract and open interest are measures that we use in analyzing the performance of our futures and options contracts. handled volume, matched volume and cash equities and equity options rate per contract are measures that we use in analyzing our nyse cash equities and equity options performance. we believe each of these measures provides useful information for management and investors in understanding our performance. management considers these metrics when making financial and operating decisions. our calculation of these metrics may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently "open," - in other words, contracts that have been entered into but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange. the following charts and table present our year-end open interest for our futures and options contracts (in thousands, except for percentages):

handled volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, etfs and crossing session activity internally matched on our exchanges or routed to and executed on an external market center. matched volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, etfs and crossing session activity executed on our exchanges.
transaction-based expenses our equities and equity options markets pay fees to the sec pursuant to section 31 of the exchange act. section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. these section 31 fees are assessed to recover the government's costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and professionals and are subject to change. we, in turn, collect corresponding activity assessment fees from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges, and recognize these amounts in our transaction and clearing revenues when invoiced. the activity assessment fees are designed to equal the section 31 fees. as a result, activity assessment fees and the corresponding section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income, although the timing of payment by us will vary from collections. section 31 fees were $293 million and $499 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the decrease in section 31 fees was primarily due to a decrease in rates. the fees we collect are included in cash at the time of receipt and we remit the amounts to the sec semi-annually as required. the total amount is included in current liabilities and was $79 million as of december 31, 2023.
we make liquidity payments to cash and options trading customers, as well as routing charges made to other exchanges which are included in transaction-based expenses. we incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. in that case, we route the customer's order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. the external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. we record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. cash liquidity payments, routing and clearing fees were $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively.

in the table above, we consider fixed income data and analytics revenues and other data and network services revenues to be recurring revenues.
in both 2023 and 2022, 11%, of our fixed income and data services segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro compared to the u.s. dollar during 2023, our fixed income and data services revenues were higher by $3 million in 2023 than in 2022.
fixed income and data services revenues our fixed income and data services revenues increased 7% in 2023 from 2022 due to growth in our other data and network services and our fixed income data and analytics products, coupled with strength in cds clearing.
•fixed income execution: fixed income execution includes revenues from ice bonds. execution fees are reported net of rebates, which were nominal in 2023 and 2022. our fixed income execution revenues increased 23% in 2023 from 2022 due to increased activity as a result of continued interest rate volatility.
•cds clearing: cds clearing revenues increased 18% in 2023 from 2022. the notional value of cds cleared was $18.8 trillion and $23.8 trillion in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the increase in revenues was primarily due to net interest income on collateral balances.
•fixed income data and analytics: our fixed income data and analytics revenues increased 2% in 2023 from 2022 primarily due to strength in our index business and growth in our pricing and reference data business.
•other data and network services: our other data and network services revenues increased 7% in 2023 from 2022. the increase in revenues was driven by growth in our ice global network offering, coupled with strength in our desktops, feeds and derivatives analytics revenues.
annual subscription value, or asv, represents, at a point in time, the data services revenues, which includes fixed income data and analytics as well as other data and network services, subscribed for the succeeding 12 months. asv does not include new sales, contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that 12-month period. however, while it is an indicative forward-looking metric, it does not provide a precise growth forecast of the next 12 months of data services revenues. management considers asv metrics when making financial and operating decisions, and believes asv is useful for management and investors in understanding our data services business performance.
as of december 31, 2023, asv was $1.752 billion, which increased 4.2% compared to the asv as of december 31, 2022. asv represents nearly 100% of total data services revenues for this segment. this does not adjust for year-over-year foreign exchange fluctuations.

in the table above, we consider subscription fee and certain other revenues to be recurring revenues. each revenue classification above contains a mix of recurring and transaction revenues, based on the various service offerings described in more detail below.
during 2023, we reclassified certain revenues within our mortgage technology segment that were previously included in other revenues to closing solutions, origination technology and data and analytics revenues. closing solutions revenues now include membership dues, and origination technology revenues and data and analytics revenues now include mortgage-related professional services revenues. as of december 31, 2023, other revenues are no longer separately presented. we believe this is a more accurate reflection of the nature of these revenues. the impact of this change was not material, and the prior year periods have been adjusted for comparability. additionally, following the acquisition of black knight and beginning in the third quarter of 2023, we have added servicing software to our mortgage technology segment revenues. the comparable periods in 2022 results do not include a contribution from the black knight acquisition.
mortgage technology revenues our mortgage technology revenues are derived from our comprehensive, end-to-end u.s. residential mortgage platform. our mortgage technology business is intended to enable greater workflow efficiency and mitigate risks for customers throughout the mortgage life cycle. black knight contributed $363 million of revenues in 2023 following completion of the acquisition. excluding the revenue contributed by black knight, mortgage technology revenues decreased $175 million or 15% in 2023 from 2022, primarily due to lower mortgage origination volumes driven by rising interest rates.
•origination technology: our origination technology revenues decreased 13% in 2023 from 2022 due to lower transaction-based revenues as mortgage origination volumes declined during 2023, offset by $11 million of origination technology revenue from black knight following completion of our acquisition in september 2023. our origination technology acts as a system of record for the mortgage transaction, automating the gathering, reviewing, and verifying of mortgage-related information and enabling automated enforcement of rules and business practices designed to help ensure that each completed loan transaction is of high quality and adheres to secondary market standards. these revenues are based on recurring software as a service, or saas, subscription fees, with an additive transaction-based or success-based pricing fee as lenders exceed the number of loans closed that are included with their monthly base subscription, as well as professional services.
in addition, the ice mortgage technology network provides originators connectivity to the mortgage supply chain and facilitates the secure exchange of information between our customers and a broad ecosystem of third-party service providers, as well as lenders and investors that are critical to consummating the millions of loan transactions that occur on our origination network each year. revenue from the ice mortgage technology network is largely transaction-based.
•closing solutions: our closing solutions revenues decreased 25% in 2023 from 2022 due to lower mortgage origination volumes. our closing solutions connect key participants, such as lenders, title and settlement agents and individual county recorders, to digitize the closing and recording process. closing solutions also include revenues from our merscorp holdings, inc., or mers database, which provides a system of record for recording and tracking changes, servicing rights and beneficial ownership interests in loans secured by u.s. residential real estate. revenues from closing solutions are largely transaction-based and are based on the volume of loans closed.
•servicing software: our servicing software revenues include integrated mortgage servicing solutions, which help automate all areas of the servicing process, from loan boarding to final payment or default, to help lower costs, reduce risk and improve financial performance. our servicing solutions support first lien mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit on a single platform to manage all servicing processes, including loan setup and maintenance, escrow administration, investor reporting, and regulatory requirements. we also provide solutions that provide consumers with access to customized, timely information about their mortgages and allow our clients' customer service representatives to access the same customer information, which is key to increasing borrower retention. another servicing solution provides clients, third-party providers and their developers access to our growing catalog of apis across the mortgage life cycle.
our default servicing solutions help simplify the complex process for loans that move into default, while supporting servicers with their compliance requirements and to facilitate more efficient loss mitigation processes.
we also offer advanced technology to support the bankruptcy and foreclosure process, and more efficiently manage claims related to properties in foreclosure, as well as tools to support loss analysis, to help servicers make the right decisions at the right time.
•data and analytics: our data and analytics revenues increased 69% in 2023 from 2022 primarily due to $63 million of revenue from black knight following completion of our acquisition in september 2023. data and analytics revenues include those related to ice mortgage technology's data & document automation and mortgage analyzer solutions, or analyzer (formerly known as aiq), which offers customers greater efficiency by streamlining data collection and validation through our automated document recognition and data extraction capabilities. analyzer revenues can be both recurring and transaction-based in nature. in addition, our data offerings include near real-time industry and peer benchmarking tools, which provide originators a granular view into the real-time trends of the u.s. residential mortgage market, as well as credit and prepayment models, custom and proprietary analytics, valuation, and mls solutions. we also provide a data as a service, or daas, for lenders and industry participants to access industry data and origination information. the data and insights from these solutions inform, support and enhance our other solutions to help lenders and servicers make more informed decisions, improve performance, identify and predict risk and generate more qualified leads. revenues related to our data products are largely subscription-based and recurring in nature.
our data and analytics offerings include property ownership data, lien data, servicing data, automated valuation models and collateral risk scores, among others, provided to clients in the mortgage, real estate and capital markets verticals.
operating expenses, operating income and operating margin the following chart summarizes our mortgage technology segment's operating expenses, operating income and operating margin (dollars in millions). the primary driver of the increase in operating expenses is related to the impact of the black knight acquisition and the corresponding black knight related operating expenses. the resulting operating loss and negative margin is primarily related to the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred during the year. see "- consolidated operating expenses" below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses.

the majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our volume and revenues, except for certain technology and communication expenses, including data acquisition costs, licensing and other fee-related arrangements and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our data sales or overall financial performance.
we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with the growth of our business, and to vary from year-to-year based on the type and level of our acquisitions, integration of acquisitions, and other investments.
in both 2023 and 2022, 9% of our operating expenses were billed in pounds sterling or euros. due to fluctuations in the u.s. dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro, our consolidated operating expenses were $4 million higher in 2023 than in 2022. see item 7(a) "- quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency exchange rate risk" below for additional information.
compensation and benefits expenses compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. the bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and individual employee performance. the performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year-to-year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in our number of employees. the below chart summarizes the significant drivers of our compensation and benefits expense results for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except employee headcount).
2023                                                       2022                                         change employee headcount                           13,222                         8,911                      48    %
employee headcount increased in 2023 from 2022 primarily due to our acquisition of black knight.
compensation and benefits expense increased $188 million in 2023 from 2022 primarily due to $155 million attributable to our acquisition of black knight and an increase in our bonus and noncash performance-based restricted stock compensation accruals, partially offset by higher capitalized labor and lower payroll. the stock-based compensation expenses in the table above relate to employee stock option and restricted stock awards and exclude stock-based compensation related to acquisition-related transaction and integration costs.
professional services expenses professional services expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees, and may fluctuate as a result of changes in our use of these services in our business.
professional services expenses decreased $8 million in 2023 from 2022 primarily due to lower consulting expenses related to bringing certain mortgage technology-related costs in-house, partially offset by higher legal expenses primarily related to the black knight acquisition.
acquisition-related transaction and integration costs in 2023, we incurred $269 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs primarily due to legal, consulting and integration expenses related to our acquisition and integration of black knight and our integration of ellie mae. included in the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs was $55 million of black knight replacement restricted stock awards that accelerated due to the divestitures and certain terminations.
we expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. as a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods.
technology and communication expenses technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology and cybersecurity. these costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. communication expenses consist of costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and telecommunications costs.
technology and communications expense also includes fees paid for access to external market data, licensing and other fee agreement expenses. technology and communications expenses may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.
technology and communications expenses increased by $51 million in 2023 from 2022, primarily due to $40 million related to black knight and increased hardware and software support costs, partially offset by a decrease in license expense.
rent and occupancy expenses rent and occupancy expense relates to leased and owned property and includes rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. we have significant operations located in the u.s., u.k., and india, with smaller offices located throughout the world.
rent and occupancy expenses increased $9 million in 2023 from 2022, primarily due to $5 million related to black knight and other increases in rent and utility costs. see item 2 "- properties" above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $40 million in 2023 from 2022, primarily due to $8 million attributable to black knight, payments of claims made following a nyse system outage that occurred in january 2023, accruals for regulatory matters, an increase in travel and entertainment expenses and increased bad debt expense.
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, aircraft, hardware and networking equipment, software, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. this expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives and technology. this expense also includes amortization of internally-developed and purchased software over its estimated useful life.
we recorded amortization expenses on intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on other intangible assets, of $749 million and $610 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. during 2023, $141 million in amortization expense was related to intangible assets acquired in connection with our black knight acquisition.
we recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $466 million and $421 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the increase in 2023 over 2022 was primarily due to an increase in internally developed software assets in our mortgage technology segment.

*percentage changes in the table above deemed "n/a" are not meaningful.
interest income interest income increased in 2023 from 2022 primarily due to an increase in short-term interest rates combined with larger investment balances. interest income primarily represents interest earned on our short-term investments, and in 2023 and 2022 included $213 million and $83 million, respectively, in interest income recognized in connection with the short-term investments related to both the $5 billion of the notes (as defined in "liquidity and capital resources- debt") issued and the operating cash accumulated for the black knight acquisition. in addition, our clearing houses also earned interest income of $88 million in 2023 and $22 million in 2022. the remainder primarily relates to interest earned on various unrestricted and restricted cash balances held within our group entities.
interest expense interest expense on our outstanding debt increased $192 million in 2023 driven primarily by the debt raised to fund the black knight acquisition. interest expense on the $5 billion of senior notes issued in may 2022 to partially fund the black knight acquisition resulted in an incremental increase in interest expense of $87 million. in addition, in 2023 we incurred interest expense of $88 million on borrowings under our term loan facility and issuances under our commercial paper program (each as defined in "liquidity and capital resources-debt"), both of which partially funded the black knight acquisition. we also assumed a $1 billion senior note in connection with our black knight acquisition which resulted in $17 million of interest expense during 2023. see "- debt" below.
other income/(expense), net our equity method investments include occ and bakkt, among others. we recognized losses of $122 million and $1.3 billion during 2023 and 2022, respectively, of our share of estimated equity method investment losses, net, and impairment charges, which are included in other income/(expense), net. the estimated losses and impairment during 2023 and 2022 are primarily related to our investment in bakkt. these are partially offset by the estimated profits related to our investment in occ. both 2023 and 2022 include adjustments to reflect the difference between reported prior period actual results from our original estimates.
in 2022, after recording our share of bakkt's equity method losses, which included bakkt's impairment charge, we recorded an impairment charge on our investment in bakkt to its fair value as other expense. this was based on what we consider to be an other-than-temporary decline in fair value as a result of several factors, including consideration of the impairment charge recorded by bakkt (see notes 3 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements).
in connection with our acquisition of black knight, we acquired an investment in dun & bradstreet, which we classified as an equity investment. subsequent to the black knight acquisition and prior to december 31, 2023, we sold the entire investment for a total of $187 million and realized a total loss of $3 million on the sales, net of dividends received, which is included in other income/(expense), net in 2023.
in connection with our sale of black knight's optimal blue and empower los businesses we received a promissory note as part of the sale proceeds that was originally valued at $235 million on the divestiture date. as we elected the fair value option for the promissory note, we are required to mark the asset to fair value each reporting period. for subsequent measurement as of december 31, 2023, we wrote down the value of the promissory note, resulting in a fair value loss of $160 million, which is included in other income/(expense), net in 2023.
during 2023, we recorded an impairment related to our cat loan receivable of $16 million. during 2022, we recorded a $9 million accrual for legal settlements.
we completed the sale of our euroclear stake on may 20, 2022. the carrying value of our investment was $700 million at the time of the sale. we recorded a net gain of $41 million on the sale, which was included in other income during 2022. we did not receive a euroclear dividend during the 2022 prior to the sale of our investment.
we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $12 million and $9 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. this was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the u.s. dollar. foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other income/(expense), net, when the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables occur in non-functional currencies and there is an increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods. see item 7a "- quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk -foreign currency exchange rate risk" included elsewhere in this annual report for more information on these items.
in connection with accounting standards update, or asu, 2017-07, compensation retirement benefits: improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost, or asu 2017-07, we are recognizing the other components of net benefit cost of our defined benefit plans in the income statement as non-operating income on a full retrospective basis. the combined net periodic expense/(benefit) of these plans was ($2 million) and $2 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
non-controlling interest for consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as non-controlling interests. as of december 31, 2023, our non-controlling interests include those related to the non-ice limited partners' interest in our cds clearing subsidiaries and non-controlling interest in ice futures abu dhabi.
consolidated income tax provision consolidated income tax expense was $456 million and $310 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the change in consolidated income tax expense between years is primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pre-tax income and the changes in our effective tax rate.
our effective tax rate was 16% and 17% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the 16% effective tax rate for the current year was below the statutory u.s. federal corporate income tax rate primarily driven by the following factors: favorable audit settlements for historical years, favorable state apportionment changes and the application of the high-tax exception to global intangible low-taxed income. these 2023 tax benefits were partially offset by the impact of the u.k. corporate income tax increase from 19% to 25% effective april 1, 2023 and the tax impact of certain non-deductible black knight acquisition costs. in conjunction with the increase in the u.k. corporate income tax rate in 2023, we intend to elect the high-tax exception to global intangible low-taxed income in 2023 in our federal income tax return to be filed in 2024. our 2023 tax provision includes the impacts of this election. the 17% effective tax rate for 2022 was below the statutory u.s. federal corporate income tax rate as well, primarily driven by the deferred income tax benefit from the impairment to our equity investment in bakkt in 2022.
the oecd global anti-base erosion pillar two minimum tax rules, or pillar two, which generally provide for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, are intended to apply to tax years beginning in 2024. the eu member states and many other countries, including the u.k., our most significant non-us jurisdiction, have committed to implement or have already enacted legislation adopting the pillar two rules. in july 2023, the u.k. enacted the u.k. finance act 2023, effective as of january 1, 2024, which included provisions to implement certain portions of the oecd global anti-base erosion pillar two minimum tax rules and included an election to apply a transitional safe harbor to extend certain effective dates to accounting periods ending on or before june 30, 2028. these new u.k. pillar two rules did not have a material impact on our income tax provision as of december 31, 2023.
see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included in this annual report, for additional information on these tax items.
liquidity and capital resources below are charts that reflect our outstanding debt and capital allocation. the acquisition and integration costs in the chart below include cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired and cash received for divestitures, cash paid for equity and equity method investments, and acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, in each year.
(1) 2021, 2022, and 2023 acquisition and integration costs, net of divestitures excludes $1.2 billion, $741 million, and $187 million of proceeds from sales of our coinbase, euroclear, and dun & bradstreet investments, respectively.
we have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases, dividends and the development of our technology platforms. we believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt, but we may also incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities in the future to satisfy our liquidity needs. see "- future capital requirements" below.
see "- cash flow" below for a discussion of our capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs.
consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $899 million and $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. we had $871 million and $6.6 billion in short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. we had $680 million in restricted short-term investments as of december 31, 2023. we had $79.0 billion and $142.0 billion of cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
as of december 31, 2023, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries was $374 million. due to the application of global intangible low-taxed income as of january 1, 2018, the majority of our foreign earnings for the period january 1, 2018 through december 31, 2022 have been subject to immediate u.s. income taxation, and can be distributed to the u.s. in the future with no material additional u.s. income tax consequences. we intend to apply the high tax exception to global intangible low-taxed income in 2023, and thus the majority of our foreign earnings in the current year are not expected to be subject to immediate u.s. income taxation. however, these foreign earnings can also generally be distributed to the u.s. with no additional u.s. income tax consequences.
our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. we may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government-sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities.

debt as of december 31, 2023, we had $22.6 billion in outstanding debt, consisting of $19.0 billion of senior notes, $2.0 billion under our commercial paper program and $1.6 billion under our term loan. as of december 31, 2023, our senior notes of $19.0 billion had a weighted average maturity of 15 years and a weighted average cost of 3.6% per annum. this included the $1.0 billion principal amount of black knight infoserv llc's 3.625% senior notes due 2028, or the black knight notes, that became part of ice's consolidated long-term debt on the acquisition date of september 5, 2023 and remained outstanding as of december 31, 2023. our commercial paper notes had original maturities of 4 to 45 days, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.70% per annum and a weighted average maturity of 32 days. our term loan has a maturity date of august 31, 2025 and bears interest at a rate of 6.3% as of december 31, 2023.
as of december 31, 2022, we had $18.1 billion in outstanding debt, all of which related to our senior notes. we also had $4.0 million outstanding under credit lines at our ice india subsidiaries. as of december 31, 2022, our senior notes had a weighted average maturity of 16 years and a weighted average cost of 3.6% per annum. we did not have any commercial paper notes or term loan balances outstanding as of december 31, 2022.
we have a $3.9 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the credit facility, with a maturity date of may 25, 2027. as of december 31, 2023, of the $3.9 billion that was available for borrowing under the credit facility, $2.0 billion was required to backstop the amount outstanding under the commercial paper program and $172 million was required to support certain broker-dealer and other subsidiary commitments. amounts required to backstop notes outstanding under the commercial paper program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. the remaining $1.8 billion is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, acting as a backstop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program.
we used the net proceeds of our senior notes due in 2025, 2027, 2029 and 2062, or collectively, the notes, together with the issuance of commercial paper, cash on hand and borrowings under the term loan, to finance the cash portion of the purchase price for black knight. for additional information regarding this transaction, refer to note 3 to our consolidated unaudited financial statements, included in this annual report.
we used the $3.0 billion of net proceeds from the offering of the 2033 notes and the 2052 notes to redeem $2.7 billion aggregate principal amount of four series of senior notes that would have matured in 2022 and 2023. the balance of the net proceeds was used for general corporate purposes, which included paying down a portion of the amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. we recorded $30 million in costs associated with the extinguishment and re-financing of our existing debt in connection with our may 2022 debt refinancing. these costs are included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of income for 2022. for additional information regarding this transaction, refer to note 3 to our consolidated unaudited financial statements, included in this annual report.
in november 2023, we commenced a private exchange offer and related consent solicitation with respect to the outstanding black knight notes, pursuant to which we offered to issue, in a private offering to eligible holders, new notes in exchange for any and all of the black knight notes held by eligible holders. we also solicited consents from eligible holders to amend the black knight notes and the related indenture under which they were issued to eliminate certain of the covenants, restrictive provisions and events of default from such indenture. the private exchange offer and related consent solicitation expired in december 2023 as the condition that ice receive the consents of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the black knight notes to adopt certain proposed amendments to the black knight notes and the related indenture under which they were issued was not satisfied. in the future, we may consider alternatives to restructure the black knight notes, which may include one or more consent solicitations and private exchange offers with eligible holders. however, we are not required to restructure the black knight notes and may or may not pursue any alternatives to do so. any such transaction will only be made in compliance with applicable laws.
on may 25, 2022, we entered into a $2.4 billion two-year senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility, or the term loan. we drew down on the term loan in full on august 31, 2023 in connection with the closing of the black knight acquisition. on both september 29, 2023 and december 29, 2023, we repaid $400 million, reducing the principal outstanding balance at december 31, 2023, to $1.6 billion. draws under the term loan bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at term sofr plus an applicable margin, currently 5.46%, plus a credit spread adjustment. the proceeds from borrowings under the term loan were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the black knight acquisition. we have the option to prepay outstanding amounts under the term loan in whole or in part at any time.
our commercial paper program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable short-term interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to de-lever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or acquisition activities.
upon maturity of our commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. to mitigate this risk, we maintain the credit facility for an aggregate amount which meets or exceeds the amount issued under our commercial paper program at any time. if we were not able to issue new commercial paper, we have the option of drawing on the backstop revolving facility. however, electing to do so would result in higher interest expense.
for additional details of our debt instruments, refer to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this annual report.
capital return in december 2021, our board approved an aggregate of $3.15 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective january 1, 2022. the approval of our board for stock repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. in addition, our board may increase or decrease the amount available for repurchases from time to time.
trading plan and 0.4 million shares at a cost of $50 million on the open market. open market repurchases are only made during an open trading period and all shares repurchased are held in treasury stock.
we discontinued stock repurchases and terminated our rule 10b5-1 trading plan in august 2020 in connection with our ellie mae acquisition and in november 2021, we resumed repurchases. in december 2021, we entered into a new rule 10b5-1 trading plan that became effective in february 2022. in connection with our acquisition of black knight, on may 4, 2022, we terminated our rule 10b5-1 trading plan and suspended share repurchases. the remaining balance of board approved funds for future repurchases as of december 31, 2023 was $2.5 billion.
from time to time, we enter into rule 10b5-1 trading plans, as authorized by our board, to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock. we may discontinue stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate a rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time, subject to applicable rules. we expect funding for any stock repurchases to come from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our commercial paper program or our debt facilities. the timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions. in making a determination regarding any stock repurchases, management considers multiple factors, including overall stock market conditions, our common stock price performance, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our board, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources.
during 2023, we paid cash dividends of $1.68 per share of our common stock in the aggregate, including quarterly dividends of $0.42 per share, for an aggregate payout of $955 million, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units. refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last three years.
future capital requirements our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of growth across our segments, strategic plans and acquisitions, available sources for financing activities, required and discretionary technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business and potential stock repurchases.
we currently expect to incur capital expenditures (including operational and real estate capital expenditures) and to incur software development costs that are eligible for capitalization ranging in the aggregate between $600 million and $650 million in 2024, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology, business integration and the continued growth of our businesses.
as of december 31, 2023, we had $2.5 billion authorized for future repurchases of our common stock. we may resume repurchases of our common stock subject to achieving certain debt leverage ratio targets. refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional details on our stock repurchase program.
our board has adopted a quarterly dividend policy providing that dividends will be approved quarterly by the board or the audit committee taking into account factors such as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined net income payout ratio. on february 8, 2024, we announced a $0.45 per share dividend for the first quarter of 2024 payable on march 29, 2024 to stockholders of record as of march 15, 2024.
other than the facilities for the ice clearing houses, our credit facility, our term loan and our commercial paper program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have for liquidity and capital resources with third parties. see notes 10 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. in the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. however, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. see "-risk factors" and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this annual report.
non-gaap measures we use certain financial measures internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a manner that adjusts from their equivalent gaap measures or that supplement the information provided by our gaap measures. we use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance.
we use these measures in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance, including in this annual report, and believe that these measures, when viewed in conjunction with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation, can provide investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than gaap measures alone. in addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for making period-to-period comparisons of results because the adjustments to gaap are not reflective of our core business performance.
these financial measures are not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, gaap financial measures and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. we encourage investors to review the gaap financial measures included in this annual report, including our consolidated financial statements, to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons.
the table below outlines our adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to ice common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are non-gaap measures that are calculated by making adjustments for items we view as not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. these measures, including the adjustments and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions, except for percentages and per share amounts), are as follows:

amortization of acquisition-related intangibles are included in non-gaap adjustments as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results.
transaction and integration costs are included as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. however, we adjust for the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to acquisitions such as black knight and ellie mae given the magnitude of the $11.8 and $11.4 billion, respectively, purchase prices of the acquisitions. we also adjusted for the acquisition-related transaction costs related to the merger of bakkt and vih in 2021 due to the significance of the transaction.
we adjust for gains and losses on investment transactions and changes in the fair value of our investments. our investments are not considered to be a part of our core business operations and the impacts of changes in our investments are often non-cash in nature.
the following non-gaap adjustments are reported in the table above related to investments:
•during 2023, we excluded the combined realized loss of $3 million related to our sales of the dun & bradstreet investment, net of dividends;
•during 2022, we excluded the $41 million gain on the sale of our euroclear investment;
•during 2021, we excluded a $34 million fair value gain on our euroclear equity investment and euroclear dividends received of $60 million;
•in 2021, we excluded the $1.4 billion gain on the deconsolidation of bakkt and the $1.2 billion gain on the sale of our coinbase equity investment.
similarly, and as included in the table above, we adjust for our share of net income/(losses) and impairment charges related to our equity method investments, which primarily include occ and bakkt. our share of 2021 net losses from unconsolidated investees includes the period from the bakkt merger on october 15, 2021 through december 31, 2021. in 2023, our share of total bakkt net losses was $135 million and our share of occ net income was $16 million. during 2022, after recording our share of bakkt's equity method losses, which included an impairment charge recorded by bakkt, we recorded an impairment in our investment in bakkt to its fair value as other expense. in 2022, the total bakkt net losses and impairment was $1.4 billion and our share of occ net income was $15 million. in 2021, our share of bakkt losses was $92 million and our share of occ income was $51 million. we believe these adjustments provide greater clarity of our performance given that equity method investments are non-cash and not a part of our core operations.
we adjust for certain items related to our debt. certain debt activities, such as the early termination of notes, pre-acquisition interest and expense and accelerated amortization of debt costs are not considered to be a part of our core business operations and the impacts of changes in our investments are often non-cash in nature. the following non-gaap adjustments are reported in the table above related to our debt:
•in 2023, we excluded $170 million of interest income earned on investments from the pre-acquisition debt proceeds. this adjustment was net of $158 million of interest expense on pre-acquisition-related debt from our may 2022 debt refinancing related to the black knight acquisition.
•in 2022, we excluded $59 million of net interest expense on pre-acquisition-related debt from our may 2022 debt refinancing related to the black knight acquisition. this adjustment was net of interest income earnings on investments from the pre-acquisition debt proceeds.
•in 2022, we adjusted for costs of $30 million associated with the may and june 2022 extinguishment of four series of senior notes that would have matured in 2022 and 2023 using proceeds from our may 2022 issuance of new senior notes.
•in 2021, we adjusted for the acceleration of unamortized costs of $4 million related to the september 2021 early redemption of our floating rate notes.
other adjustments not considered to be a part of our core business operations include:
•we adjust for the 2023 fair value loss of $160 million related to the black knight promissory note as this not believed to be part of our core operations.
•a $6 million expense for claims made following a nyse system outage that occurred in january 2023;
•2023 accruals related to regulatory matters of $11 million;
•the 2023 impairment related to our cat loan receivable of $16 million. the cat was approved by the sec in 2016 to improve regulators' ability to monitor trading activity;
•a 2022 accrual related to legal and regulatory matters; and
•in 2021 we excluded a gain of $7 million related to the settlement of an acquisition-related indemnification claim and $16 million related to a legal settlement.
non-gaap tax adjustments include the tax impacts of the pre-tax non-gaap adjustments, deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles and other tax adjustments. other tax adjustments of $79 million in 2023 are primarily related to audit settlements for pre-acquisition tax matters as well as state apportionment changes in prior years. deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles include the impact of tax law changes and apportionment updates resulting in deferred tax (benefit)/expense of ($126 million), $9 million and $183 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to the following:
•deferred tax adjustments in in 2023 and 2022 related primarily to u.s. state apportionment changes; and
•deferred tax adjustments in 2021 related primarily to the u.k. tax law changes enacted in june 2021, which increased the u.k. corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% effective april 1, 2023.
•other tax adjustments in 2023 are primarily related to audit settlements for pre-acquisition tax matters as well as state apportionment charges in prior years.

non-gaap liquidity measures we consider free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow to be non-gaap liquidity measures that provide useful information to management and investors to analyze cash resources generated from our operations. we believe that free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are useful as the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors and demonstrate our ability to convert the reinvestment of capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs required to maintain and grow our business, as well as adjust for timing differences related to the payment of section 31 fees. these non-gaap liquidity measures are not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, gaap liquidity measures and may be different from non-gaap measures used by other companies. free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow, including the related adjustments are as follows (in millions):
net cash provided by operating activities                      $3,542                      $3,554                      $3,123

off-balance sheet arrangements as described in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this annual report, certain clearing house collateral is reported off-balance sheet. we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we intend to fund our contractual obligations and commercial commitments from existing cash and cash flow from operations. as of december 31, 2023, our primary cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.
our operating leases primarily relate to our leased office space and data center facilities, and as of december 31, 2023, we had fixed lease payment obligations of $442 million, with $73 million payable within one-year.
we have other purchase obligations to purchase various goods and services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding.
in addition, we have $80.8 billion in cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts payable and unsettled variation margin. clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. the cash and cash equivalent deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. ice ngx administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. it has an equal and offsetting claim to and from its respective participants on opposite sides of the physically-settled contract, each of which is reflected as a delivery contract receivable with an offsetting delivery contract payable. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits, guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts payable and unsettled variation margin.
we also have unrecognized tax benefits, or utbs. as of december 31, 2023, our cumulative utbs were $268 million, and accrued interest and penalties related to utbs were $32 million. we are under examination by various tax authorities. we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. it is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our utbs.
as of december 31, 2023, we, through nyse, have net obligations of $102 million related to our pension and other benefit programs. the date of payment under these net obligations cannot be determined. see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs.
in addition, the future funding of the implementation and operation of the cat is ultimately expected to be provided by both the sros and broker-dealers. to date, however, funding has been provided solely by the sros, and future funding is expected to be repaid if industry member fees are approved by the sec and subsequently collected by industry members.
new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. the impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout "- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments and re-evaluate them on a periodic basis. based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. the values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities.
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions are recorded at their estimated fair values. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired company over the fair value of its identifiable net assets, including identified intangible assets. we recognize specifically identifiable intangibles, such as customer relationships, trademarks, technology, trading products, data, exchange registrations, backlog, trade names and licenses when a specific right or contract is acquired. our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets may be impaired following their acquisition requires us to apply significant judgments and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows. if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments and estimates may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives whereas goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not.
in performing the allocation of the acquisitions' purchase price to assets and liabilities, we consider, among other factors, the intended use of the acquired assets, analysis of past financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. at the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation performed with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. we continue to review and assess our estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies during the measurement period provided by gaap, which ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition. accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. estimation uncertainty may exist due to the sensitivity of the respective fair value to underlying assumptions about the future performance of an acquired business in our discounted cash flow models. significant assumptions typically include revenue growth rates and expense synergies that form the basis of the forecasted results and the discount rate.
our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, and we have identified four reporting units. our reporting units identified for our goodwill testing are the nyse, other exchanges, fixed income and data services, and mortgage technology reporting units. these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value.
in accordance with asu 2017-04, simplifying the test for goodwill impairment, for both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if the fair value of the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in earnings in an amount equal to the difference. alternatively, we may choose to bypass the qualitative option and perform quantitative testing to determine if the fair value is less than the carrying value. for our goodwill impairment testing, we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and apply the quantitative approach. for our testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets, we apply qualitative and quantitative approaches.
application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. we have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. in assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. these estimates and assumptions require management's judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. we considered potential indicators of impairment to goodwill and other intangible assets for each of our reporting units, which included continued global inflation concerns and changing interest rates, including their effect on our forecasts and discount rates, among other things. other than an impairment in 2023 of certain trademark intangible assets, we did not record any impairments in 2023, 2022 or 2021 as a result of our goodwill or indefinite-lived impairment testing.
we are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. if impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. if an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis, which are assessed and conducted in accordance with our internal impairment analysis policies.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s., u.k. and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. the determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires the use of significant judgment, estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. we recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. we establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse.
the financial accounting standards board, or fasb, staff has provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of global intangible low-taxed income noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. we have made a policy election to recognize such taxes as current period expenses when incurred.
we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. if the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.
we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. at any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. to the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits.
we believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
item 7 (a).     quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. we have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies.
interest rate risk we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and indebtedness. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents and investments were $2.5 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively, of which $270 million and $346 million, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling, euros or canadian dollars, and the remaining amounts are denominated in u.s. dollars. we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. a hypothetical 50% decrease in short-term interest rates would decrease our annual pre-tax earnings by $15 million as of december 31, 2023, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents.
as of december 31, 2023, we had $22.6 billion in outstanding debt, consisting of $19.0 billion related to our senior notes, $1.6 billion under our term loan and $2.0 billion in commercial paper. see part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - debt," and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
the interest rates on our commercial paper program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions. the weighted average interest rate on notes outstanding under our commercial paper program was 5.70% as of december 31, 2023, and we did not have any notes outstanding under our commercial paper program as of december 31, 2022. the effective interest rate of issuances under our commercial paper program will continue to fluctuate based on the movement in short-term interest rates along with shifts in supply and demand within the commercial paper market.
foreign currency exchange rate risk as an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. we may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets and liabilities are recorded in pounds sterling, canadian dollars or euros, and a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros. certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. our exposure to foreign denominated earnings in 2023 and 2022 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (dollars in millions, except exchange rates):
pound sterling                                euro                pound sterling                                euro average exchange rate to the u.s. dollar in the current year             $1.2438                              $1.0817                      $1.2376                              $1.0540
average exchange rate to the u.s. dollar in the prior year               $1.2376                              $1.0540                      $1.3762                              $1.1835

(1)    represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year compared to the same period in the prior year.
we have a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. in 2023 and 2022, 14% and 13%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and in both 2023 and 2022, 9% of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. as the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the u.s. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly.
foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables occurs through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling, canadian dollars, or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. we incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $12 million and $9 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, inclusive of the impact of foreign currency hedging transactions. the foreign currency transaction losses were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the u.s. dollar. a 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2023, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity, would result in a foreign currency loss of $1 million.
we entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during 2023 and 2022 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure. although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our non-u.s. denominated assets and liabilities.
we have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions):

foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) within our balance sheet. see the table below for the portion of equity attributable to foreign currency translation adjustments as well as the activity by year included within our statement of other comprehensive income. the impact of the foreign currency exchange rate differences in the table below were primarily driven by fluctuations of the pound sterling as compared to the u.s. dollar which were 1.2732, 1.2093 and 1.3524 as of december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

the future impact on our business relating to the u.k. leaving the eu and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time, including future impacts on currency exchange rates.
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. we limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments, monitoring them on an ongoing basis and executing agreements to protect our interests.
clearing house cash deposit risks the ice clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member margin deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. refer to note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the ice clearing houses' cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts receivable and unsettled variation margin which were $80.8 billion as of december 31, 2023. while we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. as the ice clearing houses may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the clearing members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. the following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated:
•credit risk: when a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. credit risk is managed by using exposure limits depending on the credit profile of the counterparty as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. we seek to substantially mitigate the credit risk associated with investments by placing them with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.
an ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties. in addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk.
•liquidity risk: liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and at the right time. to mitigate this risk, the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets. for example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks.
•interest rate risk: interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise and cause the value of securities we hold or invest in to decline. if we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale might be made at a loss relative to the carrying value. our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments. for example, where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements, the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities. in addition, the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt (for example, u.s. treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (euro cash deposits only) with short dated maturities.
•security issuer risk: security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on the payment when the security matures or debt is serviced. this risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments.
•investment counterparty risk: investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. we mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral to securities of high quality issuers. when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the securities underlying the reverse repurchase arrangement in custody accounts under clearing house control. additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the counterparty's obligation.
the ice clearing houses may use third-party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house. clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control with credit worthy custodians. the ice clearing houses employ (or may employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role, additional advisors or custodians are available as alternatives.
•cross-currency margin deposit risk: each of the ice clearing houses may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting margin deposits denominated in u.s. dollars to secure a euro margin obligation). the ice clearing houses mitigate the risk of a currency value exposure by applying a "haircut" to the currency posted as margin at a level viewed as sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of currency volatility. cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a same-day basis.
impact of inflation we have not been materially adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant. in the event of continued inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is designed to provide material information relevant to an assessment of danaher's financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources. the md&a is designed to focus specifically on material events and uncertainties known to management that are reasonably likely to cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition. this includes descriptions and amounts of matters that have had a material impact on reported operations, as well as matters that are reasonably likely based on management's assessment to have a material impact on future operations. the company's md&a is divided into five sections:
•overview
•liquidity and capital resources
•critical accounting estimates
•new accounting standards this discussion and analysis should be read together with danaher's audited financial statements and related notes thereto as of december 31, 2023 and 2022 and for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2023 included in this annual report. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the biotechnology, life sciences and diagnostics segments for 2022 and 2021 is included in item 7 of the company's annual report on form 10-k with respect to the year ended december 31, 2022 filed with the securities and exchange commission, and should be referred to for segment information regarding these periods.
unless otherwise indicated, all financial results in this report refer to continuing operations.
overview general refer to "item 1. business-general" for a discussion of danaher's strategic objectives and methodologies for delivering long-term shareholder value. danaher is a multinational business with global operations. during 2023, approximately 60% of danaher's sales were derived from customers outside the united states. as a diversified, global business, danaher's operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic, political and geopolitical factors. danaher's geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of its products and services, help mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country, other than the united states, on its consolidated operating results. the company's individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.
as a result of the company's geographic and industry diversity, the company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges, including rapid technological development (particularly with respect to computing, automation, artificial intelligence, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization) in most of the company's served markets, the expansion and evolution of opportunities in high-growth markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, consolidation of the company's competitors and increasing regulation. the company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and the company's long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and high-growth market segments, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions and identify and consummate appropriate investments and strategic partnerships, develop innovative and differentiated new products and services with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of the company's sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated global environment. the company is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions and investments, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources (particularly in high-growth markets) in order to be responsive to the company's customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the company's operations.
business performance consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2023 decreased 10.5% and core sales decreased 10.0% as compared to 2022 primarily due to the decline of demand for covid-19-related products, and to a lesser extent declines in demand for other products and services. the impact of currency translation decreased reported sales by 1.0% and acquisitions contributed 0.5% to sales in 2023 compared to 2022. for the definition of "core sales" refer to "-results of operations" below.
geographically, the company's sales in developed markets in 2023 decreased 12% compared to 2022 driven primarily by decreased sales in north america, and to a lesser extent in western europe. for the same period, core sales in developed markets declined at a low-double digit rate, with the declines primarily attributable to the same geographic regions. the decline in core sales was primarily driven by reduced demand for products and services related to diagnostic testing associated with covid-19 in north america and western europe and a reduction in year-over-year demand in the biotechnology segment. for the same period, sales in high-growth markets decreased year-over-year by 7% due primarily to low double-digit core revenue declines in china, led by declines in the biotechnology segment due to deterioration in the funding environment and lower underlying activity levels. for the same period, core sales in high-growth markets declined at a mid-single digit rate, with the declines primarily attributable to the same geographic factor. high-growth markets represented approximately 30% of the company's total sales in 2023.
the company's net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2023 totaled approximately $4.2 billion, compared to approximately $6.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022. net earnings attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december 31, 2023 totaled approximately $4.7 billion or $6.38 per diluted common share compared to approximately $7.1 billion or $9.66 per diluted common share for the year ended december 31, 2022. the decrease in net earnings attributable to common stockholders and diluted net earnings per common share in 2023 as compared to 2022 was driven primarily by decreased core sales and lower net earnings contributed by discontinued operations in 2023 compared with 2022. refer to "-results of operations" for further discussion of the year-over-year changes in net earnings and diluted net earnings per common share for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022.
the covid-19 pandemic as overall conditions related to covid-19 improved in 2023 compared to 2022, demand for the company's products that support covid-19 related testing products, vaccines and therapeutics decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 as the covid-19 pandemic evolved to an endemic status. refer to "-results of operations" for further discussion of the year-over-year impact of covid-19 on the company's operations.
for additional information on the risks of covid-19 to the company's operations, refer to the "item 1a. risk factors" section of this annual report.
acquisitions on december 6, 2023, the company acquired abcam plc ("abcam") for a cash purchase price of approximately $5.6 billion (the "abcam acquisition"). abcam is a leading global supplier of protein consumables, including highly validated antibodies, reagents, biomarkers and assays to address targets in biological pathways that are critical for advancing drug discovery, life sciences research and diagnostics. abcam is now part of the company's life sciences segment. abcam generated revenues of approximately £362 million in 2022. the acquisition of abcam has provided and is expected to provide the company additional sales and earnings opportunities in the proteomics sector. the company financed the abcam acquisition using cash on hand.
refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding the company's acquisitions.
veralto corporation separation on september 30, 2023 (the "distribution date"), the company completed the separation (the "separation") of its former environmental & applied solutions business by distributing to danaher stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding common stock of veralto corporation ("veralto"), the entity danaher incorporated to hold such businesses. to effect the separation, danaher distributed to its stockholders one share of veralto common stock for every three shares of danaher common stock outstanding as of september 13, 2023, the record date for the distribution. fractional shares of veralto common stock that otherwise would have been distributed were aggregated and sold into the public market and the proceeds distributed to danaher stockholders who otherwise would have received fractional shares of veralto common stock.
during the third quarter of 2023, the company received net cash distributions of approximately $2.6 billion from veralto prior to the distribution date ("veralto distribution"). danaher used a portion of the veralto distribution proceeds to redeem approximately $1.0 billion of commercial paper. the company has also used, and intends to use, the balance of the veralto distribution proceeds to satisfy bond maturities and to fund certain of the company's regular, quarterly cash dividends to shareholders.
the accounting requirements for reporting the separation as a discontinued operation were met when the separation was completed. accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented reflect this business as a discontinued operation.
as a result of the separation, the company incurred $145 million and $9 million in separation-related costs during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are reflected in earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. these costs primarily relate to professional fees associated with preparation of regulatory filings and activities within finance, tax, legal and information technology functions as well as certain investment banking fees and tax costs incurred upon the separation.
refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
results of operations in this report, references to the non-gaap measures of core sales (also referred to as core revenues or sales/revenues from existing businesses) refer to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap") but excluding:
•sales from acquired businesses (as defined below, as applicable); and
references to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less any sales and operating profit, during the applicable period, attributable to divested product lines not considered discontinued operations. the portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between:
•the period-to-period change in revenue (as defined above, as applicable); and
•the period-to-period change in revenue (as defined above, as applicable) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period.
core sales (decline) growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. management believes that reporting these non-gaap financial measures provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in danaher's business and facilitating comparisons of danaher's revenue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to danaher's peers. management also uses these non-gaap financial measures to measure the company's operating and financial performance and uses core sales (decline) growth as one of the performance measures in the company's executive short-term cash incentive program. the company excludes the effect of currency translation from these measures because currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestiture-related items because the nature, size, timing and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period-to-period and between the company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.
throughout this discussion, references to sales growth or decline refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies resulting from the ongoing application of dbs.
the company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant (generally relating to the company's larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for danaher in a given period.

total sales decreased 10.5% on a year-over-year basis in 2023 primarily as a result of a decrease in core sales resulting from the factors discussed below by segment. the impact of changes in currency exchange rates decreased reported sales by 1.0% on a year-over-year basis in 2023 primarily due to the impact of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against most other major currencies in 2023. sales from acquired businesses increased reported sales by 0.5%. price increases contributed 3.0% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis and are reflected as a component of core sales decline above.
total sales increased 7.5% on a year-over-year basis in 2022 primarily as a result of an increase in core sales resulting from the factors discussed in the 2022 annual report on form 10-k by segment as well as an increase in sales from acquired businesses. the impact of changes in currency exchange rates decreased reported sales by 4.5% on a year-over-year basis in 2022 primarily due to the impact of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against most other major currencies in 2022. price increases contributed 3.0% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis and are reflected as a component of core sales growth above.
operating profit performance operating profit margins were 21.8% for the year ended december 31, 2023 as compared to 28.3% in 2022. the following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.

price increases in the segment contributed 4.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2023 as compared with 2022 and are reflected as a component of the change in core revenue decline.
during 2023, total biotechnology segment sales decreased 18.0% as a result of decreased core sales resulting from the factors discussed below, particularly lower year-over-year sales related to covid-19 vaccines and therapeutics and lower core sales generally in the bioprocessing business. total segment core sales decreased across all major geographic regions, primarily in north america, china and western europe. core sales in the bioprocessing business decreased by approximately 20% year-over-year primarily due to lower end-customer demand for covid-19 related therapeutics and vaccines and the reduction of customer inventory levels. additionally, the company believes that the tighter credit environment also contributed to a reduction across the segment in year-over-year demand from emerging biotechnology companies during the period as these customers continued to preserve capital. the company expects the impact of reduced demand and reduction of customer inventory levels to continue into the first half of 2024. additionally, the company expects core revenue for the bioprocessing business to decline for the full year 2024, as core revenue declines in the first half of 2024 more than offset a gradual improvement to core revenue growth by the end of 2024. core sales in the discovery and medical business decreased year-over-year due to lower demand for lab filtration, medical and diagnostics and genomics product lines, partially offset by increased demand for protein research products.
operating profit performance operating profit margins declined 770 basis points during 2023 as compared to 2022. the following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.
2023 vs. 2022 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:

the year-over-year decrease in cost of sales during 2023 as compared with 2022 was due primarily to the impact of lower year-over-year sales volumes, including sales volumes from recently acquired businesses, partially offset by $87 million of charges incurred in the second quarter of 2023, primarily related to excess inventory in the biotechnology segment, due to reduced demand.
the year-over-year increase in cost of sales during 2022 as compared with 2021 was due primarily to the impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, including sales volumes from recently acquired businesses and incremental year-over-year costs associated with material, transportation, labor and restructuring and continuing productivity improvement initiatives. this increase was partially offset by lower incremental year-over-year acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to inventory in connection with the 2021 acquisition of aldevron, which increased cost of sales by $59 million in 2021.
the year-over-year decrease in gross profit margin during 2023 as compared with 2022 was driven by lower core sales and the impact of product mix. year-over-year gross profit margin was also unfavorably impacted by the $87 million of charges in the second quarter of 2023 referenced above, net of an inventory charge taken in the first quarter of 2022 related to the reduction of business activities in russia.
the year-over-year decrease in gross profit margin during 2022 as compared with 2021 was driven by incremental year-over-year costs associated with material, transportation, labor and restructuring and continuing productivity improvement initiatives. in addition, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by a 2022 inventory charge related to reduction of business activities in russia. gross profit margin declines were partially offset by increased year-over-year core sales and product mix as well as the impact of acquisition-related charges incurred in 2021. the 2021 acquisition-related charges of $76 million included fair value adjustments to deferred revenue related to the acquisition of cytiva and fair value adjustments to inventory in connection with the acquisitions of aldevron and cytiva.

sg&a expenses as a percentage of sales increased 400 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2023 compared with 2022. the increase was driven by the impact of decreased leverage of the company's general and administrative cost base, including amortization expense, resulting from lower 2023 sales. in 2023, the company incurred acquisition-related costs for the abcam acquisition of $87 million and intangible asset impairment charges totaling $64 million, both of which also negatively impacted sg&a expenses as a percentage of sales. these increases were partially offset by incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with continuing productivity improvement initiatives. additionally, these increases were partially offset by charges incurred during 2022 related to impairments of certain accounts receivable and accrual of contractual obligations incurred in russia of $24 million that did not recur in 2023.
sg&a expenses as a percentage of sales declined 80 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2022 compared with 2021. the decline was driven by the benefit of increased leverage of the company's general and administrative cost base, including amortization expense, resulting from higher 2022 sales, including sales volumes from recently acquired businesses, as well as incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with continuing productivity improvement initiatives. the company's 2021 transaction costs for the acquisition of aldevron and the company's 2021 impairment charge related to a trade name also benefited the year-over-year comparison of sg&a as a percentage of sales. these decreases were partially offset by continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives, increased labor costs and incremental restructuring and continuing productivity improvement costs as well as higher amortization expense. additionally, the declines were partially offset by charges related to impairments of certain accounts receivable and accrual of contractual obligations incurred in russia referenced above.
r&d expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) as a percentage of sales increased in 2023 as compared with 2022, primarily due to the year-over-year sales decline, and to a lesser extent the timing of new product development initiatives.
r&d expenses as a percentage of sales declined in 2022 as compared with 2021, primarily due to the sales growth rate exceeding the spending growth related to new product development initiatives.
there were no other operating expenses in 2023 or 2022. other operating expenses and other operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased in 2022 compared with 2021 as a result of the contract settlement expense related to the modification and partial termination of a prior commercial arrangement and resolution of the associated litigation during 2021. refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
nonoperating income (expense) consists primarily of net unrealized and realized gains/losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the company's investments in equity securities and investments in partnerships, the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit costs, gains on the sale of product lines and impairments of equity method investments. refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
loss on early extinguishment of borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2021, the company redeemed the €800 million aggregate principal amount of 2.5% senior unsecured notes due 2025 at a redemption price equal to the outstanding principal amount and a make-whole premium as specified in the applicable indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest. the company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of these borrowings related to the payment of the make-whole premiums and deferred costs in connection with the redemption of $96 million. the company funded the redemption using available cash balances, including proceeds from the fourth quarter 2021 issuance of the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.8% senior unsecured notes due 2051.
interest costs interest expense of $286 million for 2023 was $82 million higher than in 2022, due primarily to higher average interest rates on the company's outstanding euro-denominated commercial paper borrowings in 2023 compared to 2022. interest income of $303 million for 2023 was $262 million higher than in 2022, due primarily to higher interest rates and higher average cash balances in 2023.
for a further description of the company's debt and cross-currency swap derivative contracts related to the debt as of december 31, 2023 refer to notes 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes general income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management's assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the company's consolidated financial statements. the company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.
the company's effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as further discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities, changes in tax laws and regulations, and legislative policy changes that may result from the oecd's initiative on base erosion and profit shifting. for a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states, refer to "-liquidity and capital resources-cash and cash requirements" below.
the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and non-u.s. tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis. based on these reviews, which take into account the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the other factors referenced in the prior paragraph, reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary. for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, refer to "item 1a. risk factors".
year-over-year changes in the tax provision and effective tax rate year ended december 31
the company operates globally, including in certain jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the u.s. federal statutory rate. therefore, the impact of operating in such jurisdictions contributes to a lower effective tax rate compared to the u.s. federal statutory tax rate.
the company's effective tax rate for 2023 differs from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21.0% principally due to the geographic mix of earnings described above and discrete tax benefits from changes in estimates related to prior year tax filing positions, the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, net of charges related to tax costs related to the separation, tax costs from legal and operational actions undertaken to realign certain of its businesses and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions.
the company's effective tax rate for 2022 differs from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21.0% due principally to the geographic mix of earnings discussed above and net deferred tax benefits resulting from legal and operational actions undertaken to realign certain of its businesses, as well as excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation and audit settlements and changes in estimates related to prior year tax filing positions, net of changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions.
the company's effective tax rate for 2021 differs from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21.0% principally due to the geographic mix of earnings described above and discrete tax benefits from release of reserves for uncertain tax positions from the expiration of statutes of limitation, audit settlements and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions.
the company conducts business globally and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the u.s. federal and state and non-u.s. jurisdictions. the non-u.s. countries in which the company has a significant presence include china, denmark, germany, singapore, sweden, switzerland and the united kingdom. excluding these jurisdictions, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual non-u.s. country would not have a material effect on the company's consolidated financial statements given the geographic dispersion of the company's taxable income.
the company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various u.s. and non-u.s. taxing authorities. the irs has completed substantially all of the examinations of the company's federal income tax returns through 2015 and is currently examining certain of the company's federal income tax returns for 2016 through 2021. in addition, the company has subsidiaries in canada, china, denmark, france, germany, india, italy, switzerland, the united kingdom and various other countries, states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2004 through 2022.
similar to the position it took in connection with the audit of the company's taxable income for the years 2012 through 2015, in the fourth quarter of 2022, the irs proposed significant adjustments to the company's taxable income for the years 2016 through 2018 with respect to the deferral of tax on certain premium income related to the company's self-insurance programs. the settlement of this matter for the 2012 through 2015 audit was not material to the company's financial statements but did not preclude the irs from proposing similar adjustments in future audit periods, as the irs did with the 2022 assessment. for income tax purposes, the recognition of premium income has been deferred in accordance with u.s. tax laws related to insurance. the irs challenged the deferral of premium income for certain types of the company's self-insurance policies. the proposed adjustments would have increased the company's taxable income over the 2016 through 2018 periods by approximately $2.5 billion. in the first quarter of 2023, the company settled these proposed adjustments with the irs, although the audit is still open with respect to other matters for the 2016 through 2018 period. the impact of the settlement with respect to the company's self-insurance policies was not material to the company's financial statements, including cash flows and the effective tax rate. as the settlement with the irs was specific to the audit period, the settlement does not preclude the irs from proposing similar adjustments to the company's self-insurance programs with respect to periods subsequent to 2018. management believes the positions the company has taken in its u.s. tax returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws.
tax authorities in denmark have issued tax assessments related to interest accrued by certain of the company's subsidiaries for the years 2004 through 2015. during the first quarter of 2021, the company received a notice from the danish tax authorities that included a significant reduction in the interest amounts imposed in the original tax assessments. taking into account the revised interest amounts, the assessments total approximately dkk 2.1 billion including applicable accrued interest (approximately $307 million based on the exchange rate as of december 31, 2023). during 2023, the danish national tax tribunal lifted the suspension of the company's appeal of the tax assessments and the appeal will now proceed in due course. management believes the positions the company has taken in denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and is vigorously defending its positions. the company intends on pursuing this matter through the danish high court and the danish supreme court should the appeal to the danish national tax tribunal be unsuccessful. while the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain and could take many years, taking into account the payments the company has previously made related to these assessments in order to mitigate further interest accrual claims, the company does not expect the resolution of this matter will have a future material adverse impact to the company's financial statements, including its cash flow and effective tax rate.
the company expects its 2024 effective tax rate to be approximately 17.5% which is higher than the 2023 rate due primarily to the impact of net discrete tax benefits on the 2023 effective tax rate that are not expected to repeat in 2024. any future legislative changes in the united states and/or potential tax reform in other jurisdictions could cause the company's effective tax rate to differ from this estimate. refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to income taxes.
discontinued operations as further discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, discontinued operations includes the results of the veralto business which was disposed on the first day of the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as an income tax benefit in 2021 related to the fortive business which was disposed of during the third quarter of 2016.
in 2023, earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, were $543 million and reflected the operating results of the veralto businesses prior to the separation, net of certain costs associated with the separation including costs related to establishing veralto as a stand-alone entity and related legal, accounting and investment banking fees. in 2022 and 2021, earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, were $881 million and $986 million, respectively, and reflect the operations of veralto as well as a $86 million income tax benefit in 2021 related to the release of previously provided reserves associated with uncertain tax positions on certain of the company's tax returns which were jointly filed with fortive entities. these reserves were released due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for those returns. all fortive entity-related balances are included in the income tax benefit related to discontinued operations for the year ended december 31, 2021.
refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
comprehensive income comprehensive income decreased by $450 million in 2023 as compared to 2022, primarily driven by lower net earnings in 2023 compared to 2022, partially offset by the impact of gains from foreign currency translation adjustments in 2023 compared to losses in 2022 net of a decrease in income from pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments in 2023 compared to 2022. the company recorded a foreign currency translation gain of $215 million for 2023 compared to a loss of approximately $2.1 billion for 2022. the foreign currency translation gains were primarily driven by the change in the exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and the euro and swedish krona. foreign currency translation adjustments reflect the gain or loss resulting from the impact of the change in currency exchange rates on the company's foreign operations as they are translated to the company's reporting currency, the u.s. dollar. the company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit loss of $51 million for 2023 compared to a gain of $209 million for 2022. the company recorded losses from cash flow hedge adjustments related to the company's derivative contracts in 2023 of $14 million compared to gains of $51 million in 2022.
financial instruments and risk management the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices as well as credit risk, each of which could impact its consolidated financial statements. the company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. the company also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to manage currency exchange risks and interest rate risks. in addition, the company's broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its financial statements as a whole.
interest rate risk the company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and at times variable-rate debt. a change in interest rates on fixed-rate debt impacts the fair value of the debt but not the company's earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed. generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. as of december 31, 2023, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company's fixed-rate long-term debt by approximately $1.4 billion.
as of december 31, 2023, the company had no variable-rate debt obligations, however, the interest rates of the company's euro-based commercial paper borrowings are fixed based on short-term market rates at the time of issuance (refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company's outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31, 2023). as a result, the company's primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term interest rates. as these shorter duration obligations mature, the company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings, to the extent commercial paper markets are available. in 2023, the average annual interest rate associated with the company's outstanding commercial paper borrowings was approximately 350 basis points. a hypothetical increase of this average by 100 basis points would have increased the company's 2023 interest expense by approximately $18 million.
refer to note 15 for discussion of the company's cross-currency swap derivative contracts and interest rate swap agreements.
currency exchange rate risk the company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than danaher's functional currency or the functional currency of its applicable subsidiary. the company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign operations into u.s. dollars, danaher's functional currency. costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into u.s. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. as a result, the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the u.s. dollar. in particular, the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. therefore, when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the u.s. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company's net investment in non-u.s. subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of stockholders' equity.
currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2023 reported sales on a year-over-year basis primarily due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against most major currencies during 2023. strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other major currencies in 2024 compared to the exchange rates in effect as of december 31, 2023 would adversely impact the company's sales and results of operations on an overall basis. any weakening of the u.s. dollar against other major currencies in 2024 compared to the exchange rates in effect as of december 31, 2023 would positively impact the company's sales and results of operations.
the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this transactional exchange risk, although the company has used foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps to hedge a portion of its net investments in non-u.s. operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the u.s. dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales and net earnings in the company's consolidated financial statements. in addition, the company has assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies. a 10% depreciation in major currencies relative to the u.s. dollar as of december 31, 2023 would have reduced foreign currency-denominated net assets and stockholders' equity by approximately $1.6 billion. refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company's hedging of a portion of its net investment in non-u.s. operations.
equity price risk the company's investment portfolio from time to time includes publicly-traded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price. as of december 31, 2023, the company held $16 million of publicly-traded equity securities, excluding equity-method investments. additionally, the company holds non-marketable equity investments in privately held companies that may be impacted by equity price risks. these non-marketable equity investments are accounted for under the fair value alternative method with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. volatility in the equity markets or other fair value considerations could affect the value of these investments and require losses or gains to be recognized in earnings.
commodity price risk for a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices, refer to "item 1a. risk factors."
credit risk the company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments. financial instruments that potentially subject the company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, receivables from customers and derivatives. the company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution. although the company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents. the company's emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.
in addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the company's customers. the company's businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers' financial conditions as deemed appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when deemed appropriate.
the company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and typically with high-quality financial institutions, so that exposure at any one institution is limited.
liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company's liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow, cash on hand and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses (including capital expenditures), consummating strategic acquisitions and investments, paying interest and servicing debt, paying dividends, funding restructuring activities and managing its capital structure on a short-term and long-term basis. in addition, as discussed in further detail above, the company received approximately $2.6 billion of cash from the veralto distribution, a portion of which consideration the company used to redeem certain of the company's outstanding indebtedness in the fourth quarter of 2023.
the company has relied primarily on borrowings under its commercial paper program to address liquidity requirements that exceed the capacity provided by its operating cash flows and cash on hand, while also accessing the capital markets from time to time including to secure financing for more significant acquisitions. subject to any limitations that may result from market disruptions (such as the disruptions in the financial and capital markets that occurred at times in 2020), the company anticipates following the same approach in the future.

•operating cash flows continuing from operations decreased approximately $1.1 billion, or 15% during 2023 compared to 2022, due primarily to lower net earnings from continuing operations (after excluding charges for depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and unrealized investment gains/losses). these decreases were partially offset by lower cash used in aggregate for accounts receivables, inventories, trade accounts payable and prepaid and accrued expenses, including deferred taxes, in 2023 compared to the prior year.
•net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of cash paid for acquisitions and investments and capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the sale of investments, and increased primarily as a result of higher cash paid for acquisitions in 2023 compared to 2022. refer to notes 2 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a discussion of the company's acquisitions and investments.
operating activities cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities and productivity improvement initiatives, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows.
operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $6.5 billion for 2023, a decrease of approximately $1.1 billion, or 15%, as compared to 2022. the year-over-year change in operating cash flows from 2022 to 2023 was primarily attributable to the following factors:
•net earnings from continuing operations for 2023 reflected a decrease of $36 million of depreciation, amortization, stock compensation expense and unrealized investment gains/losses in 2023 as compared to 2022.
amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments. depreciation expense relates to both the company's manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease ("otl") arrangements. depreciation, amortization and stock compensation are noncash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows. unrealized investment gains/losses impact net earnings from continuing operations without immediately impacting cash flows as the cash flow impact from investments occurs when the invested capital is returned to the company.
•the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable provided $358 million in operating cash flows from continuing operations during 2023, compared to $855 million of operating cash flows used in 2022. the amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively the company manages the cash conversion cycle, which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period.
•the aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets, deferred income taxes and accrued expenses and other liabilities used $751 million in operating cash flows during 2023, compared to $558 million used in 2022. the timing of cash payments and refunds for taxes and the impact of deferred tax benefits and charges, various employee-related liabilities, customer funding and accrued expenses drove the majority of this change.
operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $7.6 billion for 2022, an increase of $190 million, or 3%, as compared to 2021. this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net earnings from continuing operations in 2022 as compared to 2021 (after excluding charges for depreciation, amortization (including intangible assets and inventory step-up), stock compensation, unrealized investment gains/losses, loss on the extinguishment of debt and contract settlement expense in 2021). these increases were partially offset by higher cash used in aggregate for accounts receivables, inventories, trade accounts payable and prepaid and accrued expenses, including deferred taxes, in 2022 compared to the prior year.
investing activities cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, including instruments leased to customers, cash used for investments and cash proceeds from divestitures of businesses or assets.
net cash used in investing activities was approximately $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to approximately $2.2 billion and $13.0 billion of net cash used in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
acquisitions, divestitures and sale of investments for a discussion of the company's acquisitions and divestitures refer to "-overview" and notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements. in addition, in 2023, 2022 and 2021, the company invested $172 million, $523 million and $925 million respectively, in non-marketable equity securities and partnerships.
capital expenditures though the relative significance of particular categories of capital investment can change from period to period, capital expenditures are typically made for increasing manufacturing capacity, the manufacture of instruments that are used in otl arrangements, replacing equipment, supporting new product development and improving information technology systems. capital expenditures totaled approximately $1.4 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the year-over-year increase in capital spending in 2023 was primarily due to expenditures to increase manufacturing capacity. in 2024, the company expects capital expenditures to be at similar levels as those of the past three years as the company continues investments in increased manufacturing capacity and to support other growth opportunities.
during 2021, certain agencies of the u.s. government, including the biomedical advanced research and development authority ("barda") within the u.s. department of health and human services, agreed to finance an expansion of production capacity related to chromatography, liquid cell culture media, buffers and cell culture powder media and single-use consumables at certain of the company's biotechnology businesses and the development of diagnostics testing technologies and the expansion of testing production capacity at certain of the company's diagnostics businesses. the company's businesses may enter into similar agreements in the future. in consideration of this financing, the u.s. government has certain rights, including rights with respect to the allocation of certain of the incremental production capacity associated with such expansion and/or rights in intellectual property produced with its financial assistance. the amount awarded pursuant to these grants in 2021 totaled $568 million and is being paid over periods ranging from one year to four years. in 2023 and 2022, the company recorded amounts related to these grants and other government assistance that offset operating expenses of $51 million and $49 million, respectively, and purchases of property, plant and equipment of $136 million and $87 million, respectively. property, plant and equipment purchased using funds provided by governments are recorded net of government assistance.
financing activities cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, borrowings under committed credit facilities, issuance and repurchases of common stock, issuance of preferred stock, payments of cash dividends to shareholders and proceeds from the separation. financing activities used cash of $273 million during 2023 compared to approximately $2.6 billion of cash used during 2022. the year-over-year decrease in cash used by financing activities was due primarily to the approximately $2.6 billion veralto distribution, partially offset by $427 million of cash distributed to veralto in connection with the separation.
financing activities used cash of approximately $2.6 billion during 2022 compared to approximately $1.3 billion of cash provided during 2021. the year-over-year increase in cash used by financing activities was due primarily to net repayments of borrowings in 2022 compared to net proceeds from borrowings in 2021.
total debt was approximately $18.4 billion and $19.7 billion as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, including notes payable and current portion of long-term debt of approximately $1.7 billion and $591 million as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. as of december 31, 2023, the company had the ability to incur approximately $4.0 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under the company's $5.0 billion unsecured, multiyear revolving credit facility ("credit facility") which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances. as of december 31, 2023, the company has classified approximately $1.0 billion of its borrowings outstanding under the euro-denominated commercial paper program as long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet as the company has the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the credit facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date. as commercial paper obligations mature, the company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings, to the extent commercial paper markets are available.
under the company's u.s. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper program, the notes are typically issued at a discount from par, generally based on the ratings assigned to the company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to the secured overnight financing rate or euro interbank offer rate, depending on the applicable currency of the borrowing.
refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company's financing activities and indebtedness, including the company's outstanding debt as of december 31, 2023, and the company's commercial paper program and credit facility.
shelf registration statement the company has filed a "well-known seasoned issuer" shelf registration statement on form s-3 with the sec that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. the company expects to use net proceeds realized by the company from future securities sales off this shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including without limitation repayment or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and/or working capital.
stock repurchase program please see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company's stock repurchase program.
dividends the company declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share of company common stock that was paid on january 26, 2024 to holders of record on december 29, 2023. aggregate 2023 and 2022 cash payments for dividends on company common stock were $778 million and $693 million, respectively, and aggregate 2023 and 2022 cash payments for the dividends on the company's mcps were $43 million and $125 million, respectively. the year-over-year increase in dividend payments in 2023 primarily related to an increase in the quarterly dividend rate on common stock beginning with the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by lower dividends paid on the mcps series a and series b as a result of their conversion into common shares in april 2022 and april 2023, respectively.
cash and cash requirements as of december 31, 2023, the company held approximately $5.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were on deposit with financial institutions or invested in highly liquid investment-grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an approximate weighted average annual interest rate of 4.2%. of the cash and cash equivalents, approximately $2.5 billion was held within the united states and approximately $3.4 billion was held outside of the united states. the company will continue to have cash requirements to support general corporate purposes, which may include working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments, paying interest and servicing debt, paying taxes and any related interest or penalties, funding its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, paying dividends to shareholders, repurchasing shares of the company's common stock and supporting other business needs.
the company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, the company may also borrow under its commercial paper programs (if available) or borrow under the company's credit facility, enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper programs (if available) and/or access the capital markets. the company also may from time to time seek to access the capital markets to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.
while repatriation of some cash held outside the united states may be restricted by local laws, most of the company's foreign cash could be repatriated to the united states. following enactment of the tcja, in general, repatriation of cash to the united states can be completed with no incremental u.s. tax; however, repatriation of cash could subject the company to non-u.s. taxes on distributions. the cash that the company's non-u.s. subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance non-u.s. operations and investments, including acquisitions. the income taxes, if any, applicable to such earnings including basis differences in our non-u.s. subsidiaries are not readily determinable. as of december 31, 2023, management believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy its cash needs, including its cash needs in the united states.
during 2023, the company contributed $10 million to its u.s. defined benefit pension plans and $36 million to its non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans. during 2024, the company's cash contribution requirements for its u.s. and its non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans are forecasted to be approximately $9 million and $35 million, respectively. the ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan's funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors.
contractual and other obligations for a description of the company's debt and lease obligations, commitments, and litigation and contingencies, refer to notes 10, 14, 17 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
legal proceedings refer to note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies, and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies, refer to "item 1a. risk factors."
critical accounting estimates management's discussion and analysis of the company's financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. the company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience, the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments.
the company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements. estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period-to-period. for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
acquired intangibles-the company's business acquisitions, including the abcam and aldevron acquisitions, typically result in the recognition of goodwill, developed technology and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the company may incur. the fair values of acquired intangibles are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by the company. significant assumptions include the discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results of the acquired business including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda"), revenue, revenue growth rates, royalty rates and technology obsolescence rates. these assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. the company engages third-party valuation specialists who review the company's critical assumptions and calculations of the fair value of acquired intangible assets in connection with significant acquisitions. in connection with the abcam acquisition during the year ended december 31, 2023, the company recognized aggregate goodwill of approximately $3.9 billion and intangible assets of approximately $2.1 billion. refer to notes 1, 2 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company's policies relating to goodwill, acquired intangibles and acquisitions.
in performing its goodwill impairment testing, the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market-based approach which relies on current trading multiples of forecasted ebitda for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the company's reporting units to calculate an estimated fair value of each reporting unit. in evaluating the estimates derived by the market-based approach, management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected. there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.
as of december 31, 2023, the company had five reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment. management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units generally decreases as these businesses are integrated into the company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth. the company's annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2023 indicated that in all instances, the fair values of the company's reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the company's reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 140% to approximately 495%. to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, the company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values. based on this hypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the company's reporting units ranged from approximately 115% to approximately 435%.
the company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. determining whether an impairment loss occurred for finite-lived intangibles requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. these analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues, expenses, market conditions and discount rates related to these assets. indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. determining whether an impairment loss occurred for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. if the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of intangible assets impairment charges recorded during 2023.
if actual results are not consistent with management's estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the company's financial statements.
contingent liabilities-as discussed in "item 3. legal proceedings" and notes 8 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). the company recognizes a liability for any legal contingency or contract settlement expense that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims, the cost of both pending and future claims and the value of the elements in the outcome. in addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors, including those discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. if the reserves established by the company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the company's financial statements.
income taxes-for a description of the company's income tax accounting policies, refer to notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements. the company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. this requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding: (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences,
(2) expected future taxable income and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the company's financial statements.
the company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when, based upon the technical merits, it is "more likely than not" that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. the company re-evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances, including when: (1) a tax audit is completed; (2) applicable tax laws change, including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (3) the applicable statute of limitations expires.
in addition, certain of the company's tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in denmark and the united states (refer to "-results of operations-income taxes" and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and does not expect the resolution of these matters to have a future material adverse impact to the company's financial statements, including its cash flows and effective tax rate. however, the outcome of these audits is uncertain.
an increase of 1.0% in the company's 2023 nominal tax rate would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2023 of $50 million.
valuation of investments in equity securities-for a description of the company's investments in equity securities and partnerships refer to notes 1, 9 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements. the company invests in publicly-traded securities, non-marketable securities of early-stage companies and equity method investments, including partnerships that invest primarily in early-stage companies.
investments in early-stage companies have significant risks, including uncertainty regarding the investee company's ability to successfully develop new technologies and services, bring these new technologies and services to market and gain market acceptance, maintain adequate capitalization and access to cash or other forms of liquidity, and retain critical management personnel. refer to "item 1a. risk factors" for a further discussion of the risks related to investing in early-stage companies.
the company's investments in publicly traded securities are measured at fair value based on quotes in active markets. for investments in non-marketable equity securities where the company does not have influence over the investee, the company has elected the measurement alternative and records these investments at cost and adjusts the carrying value for impairments and observable price changes with a same or similar security from the same issuer adjusted to reflect the specific rights and preferences of the securities, if applicable. valuations of non-marketable equity securities are complex and require judgment due to the absence of market prices, lack of liquidity and the risks inherent in early-stage companies. the uncertainty in the process of valuing securities for which a ready market does not exist may cause our estimated values of these securities to differ significantly from the values that would have been derived had a ready market for the securities existed, and those differences could be material.
the company accounts for its investments in the partnerships using the equity method. accordingly, the investments are initially recorded at cost and adjusted each period for the company's share of the partnership's income or loss and distributions received. the partnerships' investments are recorded by the partnerships on an estimated fair value basis and pose the same risks and require the same valuation judgments discussed above. as a result, changes in the value of investments in the partnership will have a direct impact on the company's earnings. impairment losses are recognized to reduce the investment's carrying value to its fair value if there is a decline in fair value below carrying value that is considered to be other-than-temporary. to determine whether there is an other-than-temporary impairment, the company uses qualitative and quantitative valuation methods.
realized and unrealized gains and losses for these investments in equity securities and partnerships are recorded in other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of earnings. a 10% decrease in the carrying value of the company's investments in equity securities and partnerships as of december 31, 2023 would result in a loss of approximately $165 million.

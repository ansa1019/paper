1the above presentation reconciles the percentage changes in net sales of the diversified industrial segment reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") to percentage changes in net sales adjusted to remove the effects of the acquisition made within the last 12 months as well as currency exchange rates (a non-gaap measure). the effects of the acquisition and currency exchange rates are removed to allow investors and the company to meaningfully evaluate the percentage changes in net sales on a comparable basis from period to period.
net sales diversified industrial north america - sales in 2023 for the diversified industrial north american businesses increased 15.7 percent from 2022. the effect of the acquisition increased sales by approximately $311 million. currency exchange rates did not materially impact sales during the year. excluding the effects of the acquisition and changes in the currency exchange rates, sales in 2023 for the diversified industrial north american businesses increased 11.7 percent from prior-year levels reflecting higher demand from distributors and end users across most markets, including, the cars and light trucks, farm and agriculture, construction equipment, heavy-duty truck, oil and gas, lawn and turf, metal fabrication, industrial machinery, semiconductor, and material handling markets, partially offset by lower end user demand in the life sciences market.
diversified industrial international - sales in the diversified industrial international businesses increased 2.7 percent in 2023. the effect of the acquisition increased sales by approximately $128 million. currency exchange rates decreased sales by approximately $465 million, reflecting the strengthening of the u.s. dollar primarily against currencies in the eurozone countries, china and japan. excluding the effects of the acquisition and changes in the currency exchange rates, sales in 2023 for the diversified industrial international businesses increased 8.7 percent from 2022 levels. during 2023, europe, the asia pacific region, and latin america accounted for approximately 75 percent, 10 percent, and 15 percent, respectively, of the increase in sales.
within europe, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment, cars and light trucks, heavy-duty truck, oil and gas, industrial machinery, material handling, metal fabrication, farm and agriculture, and semiconductor markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the power generation market.
within the asia pacific region, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment, cars and light trucks, marine, heavy-duty truck, telecommunications, engines, and mining markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the life sciences, refrigeration, and semiconductor markets.
within latin america, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the cars and light trucks, oil and gas, farm and agriculture, railroad, and metal fabrication markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the construction equipment and industrial machinery markets.
within europe, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment, heavy-duty truck, industrial machinery, life sciences, machine tool, mining, material handling, engines, and forestry markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the cars and light trucks, semiconductor, telecommunications, and oil and gas markets.
within the asia pacific region, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the semiconductor, refrigeration, industrial machinery, life sciences, and machine tool markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the engines, power generation, heavy-duty truck, railroad equipment, and material handling markets.

operating margin diversified industrial north america - operating margins in 2023 increased from 2022 primarily due to benefits from higher sales volume, continuous improvement initiatives and price increases, partially offset by higher material and operating costs resulting from the inflationary environment, as well as unfavorable product mix.
diversified industrial international - operating margins in 2023 increased from 2022 primarily due to benefits from continuous improvement initiatives and price increases, partially offset by higher material and operating costs resulting from the inflationary environment, as well as unfavorable product mix.
operating margins in 2022 increased from 2021 in both the north american and international businesses primarily due to higher sales volume and benefits from continuous improvement initiatives, as well as price increases. these increases were partially offset by increased operating costs, including higher freight, material, and labor costs resulting from the ongoing disruption within the current supply chain environment and labor market. in addition, within the international businesses, operating margin in 2022 benefited from savings related to prior-year restructuring actions.
business realignment the following business realignment and acquisition integration charges are included in diversified industrial north america and diversified industrial international operating income:
business realignment charges include severance costs related to actions taken under the company's simplification initiative aimed at reducing organizational and process complexity, as well as plant closures. acquisition integration charges in the current year relate to the acquisition of meggitt, and charges in both 2022 and 2021 relate to the 2020 acquisition of lord. during 2021, business realignment charges primarily consisted of actions taken to address the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business. business realignment and acquisition integration charges within the diversified industrial international businesses were primarily incurred in europe.
during 2022, we also incurred $6 million of expense within the diversified industrial international businesses as a result of our exit of business operations in russia. these charges primarily consist of write-downs of inventory and other working capital items.
we anticipate that cost savings realized from the workforce reduction measures taken during 2023 will increase operating income in 2024 by approximately one percent in the diversified industrial international businesses and will not materially impact operating income in the diversified industrial north american businesses. we expect to continue to take actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the diversified industrial segment. these actions are expected to result in approximately $78 million in business realignment and acquisition integration charges in 2024. however, continually changing business conditions could impact the ultimate costs we incur.
backlog the increase in diversified industrial segment backlog in 2023 was primarily due to the addition of meggitt backlog, partially offset by shipments exceeding orders in both the north american and international businesses. excluding the addition of meggitt backlog, north american and international businesses accounted for approximately 60 percent and 40 percent of the change, respectively. within the international business, the asia pacific region, europe and latin america accounted for approximately 80 percent, 15 percent, and five percent of the change, respectively.
the increase in diversified industrial segment backlog in 2022 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in both the north american and international businesses. backlog within the north american and international businesses accounted for approximately 75 percent and 25 percent of the change, respectively. within the international business, the asia pacific region, europe and latin america accounted for approximately 60 percent, 30 percent, and 10 percent of the change, respectively.
backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. the dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale.
sales aerospace systems segment sales in 2023 increased compared to prior-year primarily due to the addition of meggitt sales of $1.6 billion. sales also increased compared to 2022 due to higher volume in the commercial oem and aftermarket businesses, partially offset by lower military oem and aftermarket volume. the increase in sales was partially offset by divestitures during 2023.
sales in 2022 were higher than the 2021 level primarily due to higher commercial aftermarket and oem volume, partially offset by lower military oem and aftermarket volume.
operating margin aerospace systems segment operating margin decreased in 2023 primarily due to acquisition-related expenses, including higher estimated amortization and depreciation expense associated with the preliminary fair value estimates of intangible assets, plant and equipment, and inventory, as well as acquisition integration charges. additionally, higher commercial oem volume, an increase in contract loss reserves related to certain commercial oem programs, challenges created by the disruption within the supply chain and labor markets and higher engineering development expenses also contributed to the lower operating margin. these factors were partially offset by higher commercial aftermarket volume and cost containment initiatives.
aerospace systems segment operating margin increased in 2022 primarily due to higher sales volume, favorable commercial aftermarket product mix, higher aftermarket profitability as well as lower unfunded engineering development expenses. these benefits were partially offset by challenges created by the ongoing inflationary environment, disruption within the supply chain and labor markets as well as unfavorable commercial oem product mix.
business realignment within the aerospace systems segment, we incurred acquisition integration and business realignment charges of $90 million in 2023. we expect to incur approximately $27 million in business realignment and acquisition integration charges in 2024. however, continually changing business conditions could impact the ultimate costs we incur.
during 2022, we incurred $7 million of expense within the aerospace systems segment as a result of our exit of business operations in russia. these charges primarily consist of write-downs of inventory and other working capital items.

we have committed cash outflow related to long-term debt, operating and financing lease agreements, and postretirement benefit obligations. refer to notes 10, 11, and 12 respectively, of part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
share repurchases the company has a program to repurchase its common shares. on october 22, 2014, the board of directors of the company approved an increase in the overall number of shares authorized to repurchase under the program so that, beginning on such date, the aggregate number of shares authorized for repurchase was 35 million. there is no limitation on the number of shares that can be repurchased in a year. repurchases may be funded primarily from operating cash flows and commercial paper borrowings and the shares are initially held as treasury shares.  refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
liquidity cash, comprised of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and other investments, includes $422 million, $465 million, and $467 million held by the company's foreign subsidiaries at june 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. the company does not permanently reinvest certain foreign earnings. the distribution of these earnings could result in non-federal u.s. or foreign taxes. all other undistributed foreign earnings remain permanently reinvested.
the company has a line of credit totaling $3.0 billion through a multi-currency revolving credit agreement with a group of banks. as of june 30, 2023, $1.2 billion was available for borrowing under the credit agreement. advances from the credit agreement can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, and for the refinancing of existing indebtedness. the credit agreement supports our commercial paper program, and issuances of commercial paper reduce the amount of credit available under the agreement. during 2023, the company amended its credit agreement and extended the expiration to june 2028. the company has the right to request a one-year extension of the expiration date on an annual basis, which request may result in changes to the current terms and conditions of the credit agreement. the credit agreement requires the payment of an annual facility fee, the amount of which is dependent upon the company's credit ratings. although a lowering of the company's credit ratings would increase the cost of future debt, it would not limit the company's ability to use the credit agreement nor would it accelerate the repayment of any outstanding borrowings. refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
we primarily utilize unsecured medium-term notes and senior notes to meet our financing needs and we expect to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. during 2022, the company issued $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.65 percent senior notes due june 15, 2024, $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.25 percent senior notes due september 15, 2027, and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.50 percent senior notes due september 15, 2029 (collectively, the "senior notes"). we used proceeds of the senior notes to finance a portion of the acquisition.
the company's credit agreements and indentures governing certain debt securities contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the credit agreements for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the indentures. based on the company's rating level at june 30, 2023, the most restrictive financial covenant provides that the ratio of debt to debt-shareholders' equity cannot exceed 0.65 to 1.0. at june 30, 2023, the company's debt to debt-shareholders' equity ratio was 0.55 to 1.0. we are in compliance, and expect to remain in compliance, with all covenants set forth in the credit agreement and indentures.
our goal is to maintain an investment-grade credit profile. the rating agencies periodically update our credit ratings as events occur. at june 30, 2023, the long-term credit ratings assigned to the company's senior debt securities by the credit rating agencies engaged by the company were as follows:

supply chain financing we continue to identify opportunities to improve our liquidity and working capital efficiency, which includes the extension of payment terms with our suppliers. we currently have supply chain financing ("scf") programs with financial intermediaries, which provide certain suppliers the option to be paid by the financial intermediaries earlier than the due date on the applicable invoice. we are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial intermediaries and the suppliers in connection with the programs. the range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the programs. we do not reimburse suppliers for any costs they incur for participation in the programs and their participation is completely voluntary. amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the scf programs are included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet. accounts payable included approximately $85 million and $46 million payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in the scf programs as of june 30, 2023 and june 30, 2022, respectively. in 2023 and 2022, the amount settled through the scf programs and paid to participating financial institutions totaled $284 million and $35 million, respectively. the increase in the amount outstanding in the programs from the june 30, 2022 balance is primarily due to the addition of meggitt's scf program. we account for payments made under the programs in the same manner as our other accounts payable, which is a reduction to our cash flows from operations. we do not believe that changes in the availability of supply chain financing will have a significant impact on our liquidity.
strategic acquisitions upon announcing the acquisition on august 2, 2021, the company entered into the bridge credit agreement where lenders committed to provide senior, unsecured financing in the aggregate principal amount of £6.5 billion. in july 2022, after consideration of an escrow balance designated for the acquisition and funds available under the $2.0 billion term loan facility, we reduced the aggregate committed principal amount of the bridge credit agreement to zero, and the bridge credit agreement was terminated.
during september 2022, the company fully drew against the $2.0 billion term loan facility, which will mature in september 2025, to finance a portion of the acquisition. subsequently, during the year we made principal payments totaling $1.1 billion related to the term loan facility. refer to note 10 of the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
on september 12, 2022, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding ordinary shares of meggitt for 800 pence per share, resulting in an aggregate cash purchase price of $7.2 billion, including the assumption of debt. we funded the purchase using cash and net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and commercial paper and the term loan facility, which were accumulated in an escrow account designated for the acquisition. refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
upon closing the acquisition, we settled the deal-contingent forward contracts entered into during october 2021 to mitigate the risk of appreciation in the gbp-denominated purchase price. these deal-contingent forward contracts had an aggregate notional amount of £6.4 billion. refer to the cash flows section above and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
on april 11, 2022, the european commission cleared the acquisition, conditional on full compliance with commitments offered by parker, including a commitment to divest its aircraft wheel and brake business within the aerospace systems segment. in accordance with these commitments, we sold the aircraft wheel and brake business in september 2022 for proceeds of $443 million. refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. the policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment.
revenue recognition - revenues are recognized when control of performance obligations, which are distinct goods or services within the contract, is transferred to the customer. control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the goods or services. a majority of our revenues are recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment. however, a portion of our revenues are recognized over time if the customer simultaneously receives control as we perform work under a contract, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced, or if the product has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment.
for contracts where revenue is recognized over time, we use the cost-to-cost or units of delivery method depending on the nature of the contract, including length of production time. the estimation of costs and efforts expended requires management's judgment due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved. adjustments to these estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues.
when there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. the primary method used to estimate a standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers for the same product or service. revenue is recognized when control of the individual performance obligations is transferred to the customer.
impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets - we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. our five reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments. as quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, determining whether an impairment occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit, which is estimated using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. the income-based valuation method utilizes a discounted cash flow model which requires several assumptions, including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industry-specific market conditions. each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis. within the discounted cash flow models, the company uses a discount rate, commensurate with its cost of capital but adjusted for inherent business risks, and an appropriate terminal growth factor. the market-based valuation performed for each reporting unit includes an analysis consisting of market-adjusted multiples based on key data points for guideline public companies. we also reconcile the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units resulting from these procedures to our overall market capitalization.
at december 31, 2022, the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for each of its five reporting units. the results of this test indicated the fair value substantially exceeded carrying value for all reporting units. we continually monitor our reporting units for impairment indicators and update assumptions used in the most recent calculation of a reporting unit's fair value as appropriate.
long-lived assets held for use, which primarily includes finite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value. the long-term nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test. during 2023, the company did not record any material impairments related to long-lived assets.
pensions - the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the company's defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis. this determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate, long-term rate of return on plan assets, increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses. assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements.
for the company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan, a 50 basis point change in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated to have an $18 million effect on annual pension expense and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to decrease annual pension expense by $3 million. as of june 30, 2023, $342 million of past years' net actuarial losses related to the company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future. these losses will generally be amortized over approximately seven years and will negatively affect earnings in the future. any actuarial gains experienced in future years will help offset the effect of the net actuarial loss amortization. further information on pensions is provided in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
business combinations - from time to time, we may enter into business combinations. business acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which allocates the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. in the fair value evaluation of intangible assets acquired, there are significant estimates and assumptions, including forecasts of future cash flows, revenues; and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; as well as the selection of the royalty rates and discount rates. the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. the acquisition method of accounting also requires us to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. if we are required to adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
income taxes - significant judgment is required in determining the company's income tax expense and in evaluating tax positions. deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been recorded for the differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities. factors considered by the company in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets include forecasted operating earnings, available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse. the company reviews its tax positions on a regular basis and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon examination by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information will be recorded. for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. further information on income taxes is provided in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
loss contingencies - the company has a number of loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims, product liability and litigation reserves. establishing loss accruals for these matters requires management's estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization. we review these loss accruals periodically and make adjustments to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances.
recently issued accounting pronouncements recently issued accounting pronouncements are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.

business strategy (all registrants)
ppl operates four regulated utilities located in pennsylvania, kentucky and rhode island. each of these jurisdictions has distinct regulatory structures and each of the utilities has distinct customer classes.
ppl's strategy, which is supported by the other registrants and subsidiaries, is to achieve industry-leading performance in safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and operational efficiency; to advance a clean energy transition while maintaining affordability and reliability; to maintain a strong financial foundation and create long-term value for our shareowners; to foster a diverse and exceptional workplace; and to build strong communities in areas that we serve.
central to ppl's and the other registrants' strategy is recovering capital project costs efficiently through various rate-making mechanisms, including periodic base rate case proceedings using forward test years, annual ferc formula rate mechanisms and other regulatory agency-approved recovery mechanisms designed to limit regulatory lag. in kentucky, in addition to ferc formula rates, the kpsc has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ecr, dsm, glt, fuel adjustment clause, and gas supply clause) and recovery on construction work-in-progress that reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. in pennsylvania, ferc formula rates, dsic mechanism, smart meter rider and other recovery mechanisms operate to reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. in rhode island, ferc formula rates, the gas cost adjustment, net metering, infrastructure, safety and reliability (isr) and revenue decoupling mechanisms and other rate adjustment mechanisms operate to reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs.
financial and operational developments talen litigation (ppl and ppl electric)
on december 22, 2023, ppl announced that it entered into a settlement agreement (settlement agreement) with talen montana, llc and affiliated entities (talen) to resolve all claims made by talen in talen montana, llc et al. v. ppl corp. et al, adv. no 22-09001 pending before the u.s. bankruptcy court for the southern district of texas and arising out of the june 2015 spinoff of ppl energy supply, which was renamed talen. under the terms of the settlement agreement, ppl paid talen $115 million and talen dismissed all claims against ppl. separately, ppl and riverstone mutually agreed to dismiss all remaining claims in a settlement in january 2024. this matter is now concluded. see "legal matters" in note 13 to the financial statements for additional information.
purchase of renewable tax credits (ppl)
during 2023, ppl purchased approximately $300 million of renewable tax credits, as allowed by the ira. the credits were acquired at a discount. ppl believes that it will be able to monetize the acquired credits within the foreseeable future and recorded the associated benefit of the discount as a reduction of income taxes as of december 31, 2023. in addition, ppl recorded a deferred tax asset representing credits that will be utilized in future periods.
on april 14, 2023, the irs issued revenue procedure 2023-15, which provides a safe harbor method of accounting that taxpayers may use to determine whether expenses to repair, maintain, replace, or improve natural gas transmission and distribution property must be capitalized for tax purposes. ppl and lg&e are currently reviewing the revenue procedure to determine its potential impact on their financial statements.
regulatory requirements
the registrants cannot predict the impact that future regulatory requirements may have on their financial condition or results of operations.
environmental considerations for coal-fired generation the businesses of lg&e and ku are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to ccrs, ghg, and elgs. see notes 7, 13 and 19 to the financial statements for a discussion of these significant environmental matters. these and other environmental requirements led ppl, lg&e and ku to retire approximately 1,200 mw of coal-fired generating plants in kentucky since 2010. as part of the long-term generation planning process, lg&e and ku evaluate a range of factors including the impact of potential stricter environmental regulations, fuel price scenarios, the cost of replacement generation, continued operations and major maintenance costs and the risk of major equipment failures in determining when to retire generation assets.
as a result of environmental requirements and aging infrastructure, lg&e has sought and obtained approval to retire two older coal-fired units at the mill creek plant. mill creek unit 1, with 300 mw of capacity, is expected to be retired in 2024. mill creek unit 2, with 297 mw of capacity, is expected to be retired in 2027, subject to certain conditions. see note 7 to the financial statements for additional information.
cpcn and sb 4 application on december 15, 2022, lg&e and ku filed an application with the kpsc for a cpcn for the construction and purchase of various generating facilities in conjunction with the retirement of four existing coal-fired generation units and three small gas-fired units. on march 24, 2023, kentucky senate bill 4 (sb 4) went into effect, which requires kpsc approval of the retirement of fossil fuel-fired electric generating units in the state. on may 10, 2023, lg&e and ku filed an application with the kpsc seeking approval of the retirement of seven fossil fuel-fired generating units as required by sb 4. on may 16, 2023, the kpsc entered an order consolidating the sb 4 filing proceeding into the cpcn case.
on november 6, 2023, the kpsc issued an order approving lg&e's and ku's requests (i) to construct a 640 mw net summer rating ngcc combustion turbine at lg&e's mill creek generating station in jefferson county, kentucky, (ii) to construct a 120 mwac solar photovoltaic electric generating facility in mercer county, kentucky, (iii) to acquire a 120 mwac solar facility to be built by a third-party solar developer in marion county, kentucky and (iv) to construct a 125 mw, 4-hour battery energy storage system facility at ku's e.w. brown generating station. the kpsc denied the request to construct a 621 mw net summer rating ngcc combustion turbine at ku's e.w. brown generating station in mercer county, kentucky at this time, based on the finding that the construction of this unit should be deferred with the construction date beginning on a date that provides for an in-service date in 2030. the order also authorized lg&e's and ku's entry into the four solar ppas, subject to certain conditions, but deferred for future proceedings specific decisions on cost recovery treatment or mechanisms. further, the order approved the new, adjusted or expanded energy efficiency programs contained in the requested 2024-2030 dsm plan.
the new ngcc facility will be jointly owned by lg&e (31%) and ku (69%) and the solar units will be jointly owned by lg&e (37%) and ku (63%), the battery storage unit will be owned by lg&e, and the proposed ppa transactions and dsm programs will be entered into or conducted jointly by lg&e and ku, consistent with lg&e and ku's shared dispatch, cost allocation, tariff or other frameworks.
see note 7 to the financial statements for additional information.
kentucky march 2023 storm on march 3, 2023, lg&e and ku experienced significant windstorm activity in their service territories, resulting in substantial damage to certain of lg&e's and ku's assets with total costs incurred through december 31, 2023 of $74 million ($33 million at lg&e and $41 million at ku). on march 17, 2023, lg&e and ku submitted a filing with the kpsc requesting regulatory asset treatment of the extraordinary operations and maintenance expenses portion of the costs incurred related to the windstorm. on april 5, 2023, the kpsc issued an order approving the request for accounting purposes, noting that approval for recovery would be determined in lg&e's and ku's next base rate cases. as of december 31, 2023, lg&e and ku recorded regulatory assets related to the storm of $8 million and $11 million.
ferc transmission rate filing in 2018, lg&e and ku applied to the ferc requesting elimination of certain on-going waivers and credits to a sub-set of transmission customers relating to the 1998 merger of lg&e's and ku's parent entities and the 2006 withdrawal of lg&e and ku from the midcontinent independent system operator, inc. (miso), a regional transmission operator and energy market. the application sought termination of lg&e's and ku's commitment to provide certain kentucky municipalities mitigation for certain horizontal market power concerns arising out of the 1998 lg&e and ku merger and 2006 miso withdrawal. the amounts at issue are generally waivers or credits granted to a limited number of kentucky municipalities for either certain lg&e and ku or miso transmission charges incurred for transmission service received. in 2019, the ferc granted lg&e's and ku's request to remove the ongoing credits, conditioned upon the implementation by lg&e and ku of a transition mechanism for certain existing power supply arrangements, which was subsequently filed, modified, and approved by the ferc in 2020 and 2021. in 2020, lg&e and ku and other parties filed appeals with the d.c. circuit court of appeals regarding the ferc's orders on the elimination of the mitigation and required transition mechanism. in august 2022, the d.c. circuit court of appeals issued an order remanding the proceedings back to the ferc. on may 18, 2023, the ferc issued an order on remand reversing its 2019 decision and requiring lg&e and ku to refund credits previously withheld, including under such transition mechanism. lg&e and ku filed a petition for review of the ferc's may 18, 2023 order with the d.c. circuit court of appeals, and provided refunds in accordance with the ferc order on december 1, 2023. the ferc issued an order on lg&e and ku's compliance filing on november 16, 2023, and lg&e and ku filed a petition for review of this november 16 order on february 14, 2024. the proceedings at the d.c. circuit court of appeals were held on abeyance until february 15, 2024, but a motion to hold the proceedings on abeyance for an additional 60 days was filed on february 15, 2024, to allow the ferc time to substantively address lg&e and ku's request for rehearing of the november 16 order. lg&e and ku cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the proceedings or any other post decision process but do not expect the annual impact to have a material effect on their operations or financial condition. lg&e and ku currently receive recovery of certain waivers and credits primarily through base rates increases, provided, however, that increases associated with the ferc's may 18, 2023 order are expected to be subject to future rate proceedings.
advanced metering functionality (amf)
in 2021, rie filed its updated amf business case and grid modernization plan (gmp) with the ripuc in accordance with the amended settlement agreement (asa) approved by the ripuc in august 2018, and which among other things, sought approval to deploy smart meters throughout the service territory. after ppl completed the acquisition of rie, rie filed a new amf business case with the ripuc in 2022, consisting of a detailed proposal for full-scale deployment of amf across its electric service territory.
on september 27, 2023, the ripuc unanimously approved rie to deploy an amf-based metering system for the electric distribution business. rie is authorized to seek recovery of the approved capital investment through the isr process with an overall multi-year cap on recovery at approximately $153 million, subject to certain terms, conditions and limitations with respect to the potential offsets and recoverability of certain costs. rie is required to continue spending even if above the recovery cap, until it achieves the functionalities outlined in the amf business case. rie filed with the ripuc (i) an updated electric service quality plan on december 27, 2023 for ripuc approval and (ii) additional compliance tariff provisions regarding recovery and updated cost schedules to reflect the ripuc's decision on december 22, 2023 for ripuc approval. rie cannot predict the outcome of these matters.

earnings from ongoing operations management utilizes "earnings from ongoing operations" as a non-gaap financial measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income, an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with gaap. ppl believes that earnings from ongoing operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of ppl's earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions. in addition, ppl's management uses earnings from ongoing operations in measuring achievement of certain corporate performance goals, including targets for certain executive incentive compensation. other companies may use different measures to present financial performance.
earnings from ongoing operations is adjusted for the impact of special items. special items are presented in the financial tables on an after-tax basis with the related income taxes on special items separately disclosed. income taxes on special items, when applicable, are calculated based on the statutory tax rate of the entity where the activity is recorded. special items may include items such as:
•    gains and losses on sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business.
•    significant workforce reduction and other restructuring effects.
•    acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments.
•    other charges or credits that are, in management's view, non-recurring or otherwise not reflective of the company's ongoing operations.

the registrants expect to continue to have adequate liquidity available from operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, credit facilities and commercial paper issuances to meet their requirements with respect to their contractual obligations and anticipated capital expenditures. additionally, subject to market conditions, the registrants and their subsidiaries may access the capital markets, and ppl electric, lg&e and ku anticipate receiving equity contributions from their parent or member in 2024.
credit facilities the registrants maintain credit facilities to enhance liquidity, provide credit support and provide a backstop to commercial paper programs. amounts borrowed under these credit facilities are reflected in "short-term debt" on the balance sheets. at december 31, 2023, the total committed borrowing capacity under credit facilities and the borrowings under these facilities were:

(a)includes a $1.25 billion syndicated credit facility with a $250 million borrowing sublimit for rie and a $1 billion sublimit for ppl capital funding at december 31, 2023. rie's borrowing sublimit is adjustable, at the borrowers' option, from $0 to $600 million, with the remaining balance of the $1.25 billion available under the facility allocated to ppl capital funding. at december 31, 2023, ppl capital funding had $365 million of commercial paper outstanding and rie had $25 million of commercial paper outstanding. on january 5, 2024, the borrowing sublimits under the facility were reallocated to $400 million at rie and $850 million at ppl capital funding.
(b)the syndicated credit facilities and ppl capital funding's bilateral facility, each contain a financial covenant requiring debt to total capitalization not to exceed 70% for ppl capital funding, rie, ppl electric, lg&e and ku, as calculated in accordance with the facility, and other customary covenants.
the commitments under the credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group, with no one bank and its affiliates providing an aggregate commitment of more than the following percentages of the total committed capacity: ppl - 9%, ppl electric - 7%, lg&e - 7% and ku - 7%.
(c)each company pays customary fees under its respective syndicated credit facility. borrowings generally bear interest at applicable sofr, plus an applicable margin.
(d)commercial paper issued reflects the undiscounted face value of the issuance.
in addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, the credit agreements governing the above credit facilities contain various other covenants. failure to comply with the covenants after applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of repayment of borrowings and/or termination of the agreements. the registrants monitor compliance with the covenants on a regular basis. at december 31, 2023, the registrants were in compliance with these covenants. at this time, the registrants believe that these covenants and other borrowing conditions will not limit access to these funding sources.
see note 8 to the financial statements for further discussion of the registrants' credit facilities.

contributions from parent (ppl electric, lg&e and ku)
from time to time, the parents of ppl electric, lg&e and ku make capital contributions to subsidiaries. the proceeds from these contributions are used to fund capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes.
forecasted uses of cash
in addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as purchased power, payroll, fuel and taxes, the registrants currently expect to incur future cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual obligations, payment of dividends on its common stock, and possibly the purchase or redemption of a portion of debt securities.
capital expenditures the table below shows the registrants' current capital expenditure projections for the years 2024 through 2026. expenditures for the domestic regulated utilities are expected to be recovered through rates, pending regulatory approval.

contractual obligations the registrants have assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the ordinary course of conducting business. at december 31, 2023, estimated contractual cash obligations were as follows:
unconditional power purchase obligations                     78                       29                      49                          -                          -

unconditional power purchase obligations (f)                132                     12                      22                         21                         77
(a)reflects principal maturities based on stated maturity, sinking fund payments, or earlier put dates. see note 8 to the financial statements for a discussion of variable-rate remarketable bonds issued on behalf of lg&e and ku. the registrants do not have any significant finance lease obligations.
(b)assumes interest payments through stated maturity or earlier put dates. the payments herein are subject to change, as payments for debt that is or becomes variable-rate debt have been estimated.
(c)see note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.
(d)the amounts include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. primarily includes, as applicable, the purchase obligations of electricity, coal, natural gas and limestone, as well as certain construction expenditures, which are also included in the capital expenditures discussion above.
(e)represents contracts to purchase coal, natural gas and natural gas transportation. see note 13 to the financial statements for additional information.
(f)represents future minimum payments under ovec power purchase agreements through june 2040. see note 13 to the financial statements for additional information.
(g)represents construction commitments, which are also reflected in the capital expenditures table presented above.
ppl views dividends as an integral component of shareowner return and expects to continue to pay dividends in amounts intended to maintain a capitalization structure that supports investment grade credit ratings. in november 2023, ppl declared its quarterly common stock dividend, payable january 2, 2024, at 24.00 cents per share (equivalent to $0.96 per annum). on february 16, 2024, ppl announced a quarterly common stock dividend of 25.75 cents per share, payable april 1, 2024, to shareowners of record as of march 8, 2024. future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other factors.
subject to certain exceptions, ppl may not declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution on its capital stock during any period in which ppl capital funding defers interest payments on its 2007 series a junior subordinated notes due 2067. at december 31, 2023, no interest payments were deferred.
from time to time, as determined by their respective board of directors, the registrants pay dividends, distributions or return capital, as applicable, to their respective shareholders or members. certain of the credit facilities of ppl electric, lg&e and ku include minimum debt covenant ratios that could effectively restrict the payment of dividends or distributions.
see note 8 to the financial statements for these and other restrictions related to distributions on capital interests for the registrants and their subsidiaries.
purchase or redemption of debt securities the registrants will continue to evaluate outstanding debt securities and may decide to purchase or redeem these securities in open market or privately negotiated transactions, in exchange transactions or otherwise, depending upon prevailing market conditions, available cash and other factors, and may be commenced or suspended at any time. the amounts involved may be material.
rating agency actions moody's and s&p periodically review the credit ratings of the debt of the registrants and their subsidiaries. based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations.
a credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues. the credit ratings of the registrants and their subsidiaries are based on information provided by the registrants and other sources. the ratings of moody's and s&p are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of the registrants or their subsidiaries. such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities.
the credit ratings of the registrants and their subsidiaries affect their liquidity, access to capital markets and cost of borrowing under their credit facilities. a downgrade in the registrants' or their subsidiaries' credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. the registrants and their subsidiaries have no credit rating triggers that would result in the reduction of access to capital markets or the acceleration of maturity dates of outstanding debt.
the following table sets forth the registrants' and their subsidiaries' credit ratings for outstanding debt securities or commercial paper programs as of december 31, 2023.
senior unsecured                          senior secured                            commercial paper issuer                     moody's                    s&amp;p        moody's                    s&amp;p        moody's                    s&amp;p ppl ppl capital funding        baa1                       bbb+                                                     p-2                        a-2
the rating agencies have taken the following actions related to the registrants and their subsidiaries.
various derivative and non-derivative contracts, including contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel, commodity transportation and storage, and interest rate instruments, contain provisions that require the posting of additional collateral or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract, if ppl's, lg&e's or ku's or their subsidiaries' credit rating, as applicable, were to fall below investment grade. see note 17 to the financial statements for a discussion of "credit risk-related contingent features," including a discussion of the potential additional collateral requirements for derivative contracts in a net liability position at december 31, 2023.
guarantees for subsidiaries (ppl)
ppl guarantees certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements. some of the guarantees contain financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements, accelerate maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions. at this time, ppl believes that these covenants will not limit access to relevant funding sources. see note 13 to the financial statements for additional information about guarantees.
the registrants have entered into certain agreements that may contingently require payment to a guaranteed or indemnified party. see note 13 to the financial statements for a discussion of these agreements.
risk management market risk
see notes 1, 16 and 17 to the financial statements for information about the registrants' risk management objectives, valuation techniques and accounting designations.
the forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions and model assumptions. actual future results may differ materially from those presented. these are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but are rather only indicators of possible losses under normal market conditions at a given confidence level.
interest rate risk ppl and its subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. a variety of financial derivative instruments are utilized to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of the debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. risk limits under ppl's risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolio due to changes in benchmark interest rates. in addition, the interest rate risk of certain subsidiaries is potentially mitigated as a result of the existing regulatory framework or the timing of rate cases.

(b)effects of adverse movements decrease assets or increase liabilities, as applicable, which could result in an asset becoming a liability. sensitivities represent a 10% adverse movement in interest rates.
(c)realized changes in the fair value of such economic hedges are recoverable through regulated rates and any subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities.
the registrants are exposed to a potential increase in interest expense and to changes in the fair value of their debt portfolios. the estimated impact of a 10% adverse movement in interest rates on the fair value of debt and interest expense at december 31 is shown below.
10% adverse movement in rates on fair value of debt                            10% adverse movement in rates on interest expense for floating exposure
commodity price risk ppl is exposed to commodity price risk through its subsidiaries as described below.
•ppl electric is required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation as a plr. potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its papuc-approved cost recovery mechanism and full-requirement supply agreements to serve its plr customers which transfer the risk to energy suppliers.
•lg&e's and ku's rates include certain mechanisms for fuel, fuel-related expenses and energy purchases. in addition, lg&e's rates include a mechanism for natural gas supply costs. these mechanisms generally provide for timely recovery of market price fluctuations associated with these costs.
•rie utilizes derivative instruments pursuant to its ripuc-approved plan to manage commodity price risk associated with its natural gas purchases. rie's commodity price risk management strategy is to reduce fluctuations in firm gas sales prices to its customers. rie's costs associated with derivatives instruments are recoverable through its ripuc- approved cost recovery mechanisms. rie is required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation to provide last resort service (lrs). potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its ripuc-approved cost recovery mechanisms and full requirements service agreements to serve lrs customers, which transfer the risk to energy suppliers. rie is required to contract through long-term agreements for clean energy supply under the rhode island renewable energy growth program and long-term clean energy standard. potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its ripuc-approved cost recovery mechanisms, which true-up cost differences between contract prices and market prices.
volumetric risk volumetric risk is the risk related to the changes in volume of retail sales due to weather, economic conditions or other factors. ppl is exposed to volumetric risk through its subsidiaries as described below.
•ppl electric, lg&e and ku are exposed to volumetric risk on retail sales, mainly due to weather and other economic conditions for which there is limited mitigation between rate cases.
•rie is exposed to volumetric risk, which is significantly mitigated by regulatory mechanisms. rie's electric and gas distribution rates both have a revenue decoupling mechanism, which allows for annual adjustments to rie's delivery rates.
defined benefit plans - equity securities price risk see "application of critical accounting policies - defined benefits" for additional information regarding the effect of equity securities price risk on plan assets.
credit risk
credit risk is the potential loss that may be incurred due to a counterparty's non-performance.
ppl is exposed to credit risk from "in-the-money" transactions with counterparties, as well as additional credit risk through certain of its subsidiaries, as discussed below.
in the event a supplier of ppl, ppl electric, lg&e or ku defaults on its contractual obligation, those registrants would be required to seek replacement power or replacement fuel in the market. in general, subject to regulatory review or other processes, appropriate incremental costs incurred by these entities would be recoverable from customers through applicable rate mechanisms, thereby mitigating the financial risk for these entities.
ppl and its subsidiaries have credit policies in place to manage credit risk, including the use of an established credit approval process, daily monitoring of counterparty positions and the use of master netting agreements or provisions. these agreements generally include credit mitigation provisions, such as margin, prepayment or collateral requirements. ppl and its subsidiaries may request additional credit assurance, in certain circumstances, in the event that the counterparties' credit ratings fall below investment grade, their tangible net worth falls below specified percentages or their exposures exceed an established credit limit.
related party transactions the registrants are not aware of any material ownership interests or operating responsibility by senior management in outside partnerships, including leasing transactions with variable interest entities, or other entities doing business with the registrants. see note 14 to the financial statements for additional information on related party transactions for ppl electric, lg&e and ku.
acquisitions, development and divestitures the registrants from time to time evaluate opportunities for potential acquisitions, divestitures, and development projects. see note 9 to the financial statements for additional information on acquisition and divestiture activity. development projects are reexamined based on market conditions and other factors to determine whether to proceed with, modify or terminate the projects. any resulting transactions may impact future financial results.
environmental matters extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to the registrants' air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, as well as other aspects of the registrants' businesses. the costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with certainty but could be significant. in addition, costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws or regulations, or similar rules, are expanded or changed. costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or other restrictions. many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the costs for their products or their demand for the registrants' services. increased capital and operating costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery. the registrants can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future environmental or rate proceedings before regulatory authorities.

sustainability increasing attention has been focused on a broad range of corporate activities under the heading of "sustainability", which has resulted in a significant increase in the number of requests from interested parties for information on sustainability topics. these parties range from investor groups focused on environmental, social, governance and other matters to non-investors concerned with a variety of public policy matters. often the scope of the information sought is very broad and not necessarily relevant to an issuer's business or industry. as a result, a number of private groups have proposed to standardize the subject matter constituting sustainability, either generally or by industry. those efforts remain ongoing. in addition, certain of these private groups have advocated that the sec promulgate regulations requiring specific sustainability reporting under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the '34 act), or that issuers voluntarily include certain sustainability disclosure in their '34 act reports. in march 2022, the sec proposed broad-based climate disclosure requirements for public companies. the proposed rule would require public companies to disclose direct and indirect ghg emissions, strategic insights, and certain financial implications in public disclosures. the proposed rulemaking elicited significant debate and comment. while a final rulemaking is currently expected to be issued in the first half of 2024, ppl cannot predict the final legal requirements or when the requirements will be effective.
as has been ppl's practice, to the extent sustainability issues have or may have a material impact on the registrants' financial condition or results of operation, ppl discloses such matters in accordance with applicable securities law and sec regulations. with respect to other sustainability topics that ppl deems relevant to investors but that are not required to be reported under applicable securities law and sec regulation, ppl will continue each spring to publish its annual sustainability report including tracking reductions related to the company's goal to reduce carbon emissions and post that report on its corporate website at www.pplweb.com and on www.pplsustainability.com. neither the information in such annual sustainability report nor the information at such websites is incorporated in this form 10-k by reference, and it should not be considered a part of this form
10-k. in preparing its sustainability report, ppl is guided by the framework established by the global reporting initiative, which identifies environmental, social, governance and other subject matter categories. ppl also participates in efforts by the edison electric institute and american gas association to provide the appropriate subset of sustainability information that can be applied consistently across the electric and gas utility industries. additionally, ppl consults widely used reporting frameworks for discrete sustainability topics, including corporate political contributions and climate-related issues. ppl also responds to the climate survey of cdp, a not-for-profit organization based in the united kingdom formerly known as the carbon disclosure project, that runs the global disclosure system that enables investors, companies, cities, states and regions to measure and manage their environmental impacts.
cybersecurity see "item 1a. risk factors" and "item 1c. cybersecurity" for a discussion of cybersecurity risks affecting the registrants and the related strategies for managing these risks.
competition see "competition" under each of ppl's reportable segments in "item 1. business - general - segment information" and "item 1a. risk factors" for a discussion of competitive factors affecting the registrants.
new accounting guidance there has been no new accounting guidance adopted in 2023, please refer to note 21 for discussion of significant accounting guidance pending adoption as of december 31, 2023.
application of critical accounting policies financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. the following accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of the reported financial condition or results of operations and require management to make estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain. changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the financial statements (these accounting policies are also discussed in note 1 to the financial statements). senior management has reviewed with ppl's audit committee these critical accounting policies, the following disclosures regarding their application, and the estimates and assumptions regarding them.
defined benefits (all registrants)
certain of the registrants and/or their subsidiaries sponsor or participate in certain qualified funded and non-qualified unfunded defined benefit pension plans and both funded and unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. see notes 1, 7 and 11 to the financial statements for additional information about the plans and the accounting for defined benefits.
a summary of plan sponsors by registrant and whether a registrant or its subsidiaries sponsor (s) or participate in and receives allocations (p) from those plans is shown in the table below.
plan sponsor         ppl         ppl electric         lg&amp;e       ku ppl services         s           p lke                                                   p              p management makes certain assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. as such, annual net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings or regulatory assets and liabilities based on estimated results. any differences between actual and estimated results are recorded in aoci or, in the case of ppl electric, lg&e and ku, regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. these amounts in aoci or regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized to income over future periods. the significant assumptions are:
•discount rate - in selecting the discount rates for defined benefit plans, the plan sponsors start with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for their plans. the plan-specific cash flows are matched against the coupons and expected maturity values of aa-rated non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds that could be purchased for a hypothetical settlement portfolio. the plan sponsors then use the single discount rate derived from matching the discounted benefit payment stream to the market value of the selected bond portfolio.
•expected return on plan assets - the expected long-term rates of return for pension and other postretirement benefits are based on management's projections using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class. each plan's specific current and expected asset allocations are also considered in developing a reasonable return assumption.
•rate of compensation increase - management projects employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement. in selecting a rate of compensation increase, plan sponsors consider past experience, the potential impact of movements in inflation rates and expectations of ongoing compensation practices.
see note 11 to the financial statements for details of the assumptions selected for pension and other postretirement benefits. a variance in the assumptions could significantly impact accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and aoci or regulatory assets and liabilities.
the following tables reflect changes in certain assumptions based on the registrants' primary defined benefit plans. the inverse of this change would have the opposite impact on accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and aoci or regulatory assets and liabilities. the sensitivities below reflect an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption.

significant management judgment is required in developing the registrants' provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.
additionally, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of benefit recognized related to an uncertain tax position. on a quarterly basis, uncertain tax positions are reassessed by considering information known as of the reporting date. based on management's assessment of new information, a tax benefit may subsequently be recognized for a previously unrecognized tax position, a previously recognized tax position may be derecognized, or the benefit of a previously recognized tax position may be remeasured. the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.
the need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also requires significant management judgment. valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. management considers several factors in assessing the expected realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. any tax planning strategy utilized in this assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria utilized to account for an uncertain tax position. when evaluating the need for valuation allowances, the uncertainty posed by political risk on such factors is also considered by management. the amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.
see note 6 to the financial statements for income tax disclosures.
regulatory assets and liabilities (all registrants)
ppl electric, lg&e, ku and rie are subject to cost-based rate regulation. as a result, the effects of regulatory actions are required to be reflected in the financial statements. assets and liabilities are recorded that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under gaap for non-regulated entities. regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in regulated customer rates. regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. in certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose.
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders to the registrants and other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. based on this continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery. this assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels and is subject to change in the future. if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the regulatory asset would be written-off. additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of recovery of regulatory assets.
see note 7 to the financial statements for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities recorded at december 31, 2023 and 2022, as well as additional information on those regulatory assets and liabilities. all regulatory assets are either currently being recovered under specific rate orders, represent amounts that are expected to be recovered in future rates or benefit future periods based upon established regulatory practices.
price risk management (ppl)
see "financial condition - risk management" above.
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. the reporting units of ppl include the kentucky regulated reporting unit, the pennsylvania regulated reporting unit, and the rhode island regulated reporting unit. lg&e and ku are each single reporting units. a goodwill impairment test is performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit may be greater than the reporting unit's fair value.
the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with the carrying value and an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit.
ppl, for its reporting units, and individually, lg&e and ku, may elect either to initially make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill for impairment using a quantitative test. see "long-lived and intangible assets - asset impairment (excluding investments)" in note 1 to the financial statements for further discussion of goodwill impairment tests. see note 18 to the financial statements for information on goodwill balances by reportable segment at december 31, 2023.
as of october 1, 2023, ppl, for its reporting units, and individually, lg&e and ku, elected to perform the qualitative step zero evaluation of goodwill. these evaluations considered the excess of fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit that was calculated during step one of the quantitative impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2022, and the relevant events and circumstances that occurred since those tests were performed including:
•current year financial performance versus the prior year,
•changes in planned capital expenditures,
•the consistency of forecasted free cash flows,
•earnings quality and sustainability,
•changes in market participant discount rates,
•changes in long-term growth rates,
•changes in ppl's market capitalization, and
•the overall economic and regulatory environments in which these regulated entities operate.
based on these evaluations, management concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their carrying value. as such, the step one quantitative impairment test was not performed and no impairment was recognized.
aro liabilities are required to be recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. initial obligations are measured at estimated fair value. an aro must be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the aro can be reasonably estimated. an equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and amortized to expense, regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities over the asset's useful life.
in determining aros, management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value. fair value is developed using an expected present value technique based on assumptions of market participants that consider estimated retirement costs in current period dollars, inflated to the anticipated retirement date and discounted back to the date the aro was incurred. changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value of aros could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements. estimated aro costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the aro and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the aro estimate. any change to the capitalized asset is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset.
see "long-lived and intangible assets - asset retirement obligations" in note 1, note 7 and note 19 to the financial statements for additional information on aros.
at december 31, 2023, the total recorded balances and information on the most significant recorded aros were as follows.
most significant aros total            amount                          % of total               description aro            recorded recorded lg&amp;e           $85                 $63                               74                     ponds, landfills and natural gas mains ku                  66        37                                         56                     ponds and landfills the most significant assumptions surrounding aros are the forecasted retirement costs (including settlement dates and the timing of cash flows), discount and inflation rates. at december 31, 2023, a 10% increase to retirement cost would increase these aro liabilities by $7 million at lg&e and $11 million at ku. a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase these aro liabilities by $5 million at lg&e and $1 million at ku and a 0.25% increase in the inflation rate would increase these aro liabilities by $4 million at lg&e. there would be no significant change to the annual depreciation expense of the aro asset or the annual accretion expense of the aro liability as a result of these changes in assumptions.
revenue recognition - unbilled revenues (ppl, lg&e and ku)
for rie, lg&e and ku, revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. because customers are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of actual meter reads taken throughout the month, estimates are recorded for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of deliveries to customers since the date of the last reading of their meters. the unbilled revenue estimates reflect consideration of factors including daily load models, estimated usage for each customer class, the effect of current and different rate schedules, the meter read schedule, the billing schedule, actual weather data, and, where applicable, the impact of weather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures.

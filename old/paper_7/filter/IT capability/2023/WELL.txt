item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of welltower inc. presented in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap") for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this annual report on form 10-k. other important factors are identified in "item 1 - business" and "item 1a - risk factors" above.
on march 7, 2022, we announced our intent to complete an upreit reorganization. in february 2022, the company formerly known as welltower inc. ("old welltower") formed well merger holdco inc. ("new welltower") as a wholly owned subsidiary, and new welltower formed well merger holdco sub inc. ("merger sub") as a wholly owned subsidiary. on april 1, 2022, merger sub merged with and into old welltower, with old welltower continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of new welltower (the "merger"). in connection with the merger, old welltower's name was changed to "welltower op inc.", and new welltower inherited the name "welltower inc." effective may 24, 2022, welltower op inc. ("welltower op") converted from a delaware corporation into a delaware limited liability company named welltower op llc (the "llc conversion"). following the llc conversion, new welltower's business continues to be conducted through welltower op and new welltower does not have substantial assets or liabilities, other than through its investment in welltower op.
unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to "welltower" mean welltower inc. and references to "welltower op" mean welltower op llc. references to "we," "us" and "our" mean collectively welltower, welltower op and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by welltower and/or welltower op.
executive summary company overview welltower inc.

welltower is the initial member and majority owner of welltower op, with an approximate ownership interest of 99.765% as of december 31, 2023. all of our property ownership, development and related business operations are conducted through welltower op and welltower has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in welltower op. welltower issues equity from time to time, the net proceeds of which it is obligated to contribute as additional capital to welltower op. all debt including credit facilities, senior notes and secured debt is incurred by welltower op and its subsidiaries, and welltower has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all existing senior unsecured notes.
(1) represents consolidated net operating income ("noi") and excludes our share of investments in unconsolidated entities. entities in which we have a joint venture with a minority partner are shown at 100% of the joint venture amount. see non-gaap financial measures for additional information and reconciliation.
business strategy our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. we seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in noi and portfolio growth. to meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location.
substantially all of our revenues are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees and services, interest earned on outstanding loans receivable and interest earned on short-term deposits. these items represent our primary sources of liquidity to fund distributions and depend upon the continued ability of our obligors to make contractual rent and interest payments to us and the profitability of our operating properties. to the extent that our obligors/partners experience operating difficulties and become unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments or operating distributions to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. to mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. our asset management process for seniors item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs and market conditions among other things. we evaluate the operating environment in each property's market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility. when we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. through these efforts, we generally aim to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.
in addition to our asset management and research efforts, we aim to structure our relevant investments to mitigate payment risk. operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guarantees and/or letters of credit. also, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates.
for the year ended december 31, 2023, resident fees and services and rental income represented 72% and 23%, respectively, of total revenues. substantially all of our operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments.
our primary sources of cash include resident fees and services, rent and interest receipts, interest earned on short-term deposits, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, public issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses. depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash.
we also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments. new investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment dispositions. our investments generate cash from noi and principal payments on loans receivable. permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, has historically been provided through a combination of the issuance of public debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt. given general economic conditions in 2023, investments were generally funded proactively via issuances of common stock.
depending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. it is also likely that investment dispositions may occur in the future. to the extent that investment dispositions exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. we expect to reinvest the proceeds from any investment dispositions in new investments. to the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. at december 31, 2023, we had $1,993,646,000 of cash and cash equivalents, $82,437,000 of restricted cash and $4,000,000,000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility.

key performance indicators, trends and uncertainties we utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business. these indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance, credit strength and concentration risk. management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results, in making operating decisions, and for budget planning purposes.
operating performance we believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders ("nics") per the consolidated statements of comprehensive income are the most appropriate earnings measures. other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ("ffo") and consolidated net operating income ("noi"); however, these supplemental measures are not defined by u.s. gaap. please refer to the section entitled "non-gaap financial measures" for further discussion and reconciliations. these earnings measures are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies.
credit strength  we measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. the leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term debt, net of cash and restricted cash. the coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges (interest and secured debt principal amortization). we expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the coverage ratios are based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("adjusted ebitda"). please refer to the section entitled "non-gaap financial measures" for further discussion and reconciliation of these measures. leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, investment recommendations and rating of companies. the following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures for the periods presented:
net debt to book capitalization ratio                                    34.3%                   39.5%                   42.2%
net debt to undepreciated book capitalization ratio                      27.8%                   32.1%                   34.9%
net debt to market capitalization ratio                                  20.9%                   29.5%                   25.9%
united kingdom                                      9%                     10%                     13%
(1) excludes our share of investments in unconsolidated entities and non-segment/corporate noi. entities in which we have a joint venture with a minority partner are shown at 100% of the joint venture amount.
we evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with current expectations to determine if historical trends are indicative of future results. our expected results may not be achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. factors that may cause actual results to differ from expected results are described in more detail in "item 1 - business - cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements" and "item 1a - risk factors" and other sections of this annual report on form 10-k. management regularly monitors economic and other factors to develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize our competitive position. our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and company-specific trends. please refer to "item 1 - business," "item 1a - risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion of these risk factors.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate governance maintaining investor confidence and trust is important in today's business environment. our board of directors and management are strongly committed to policies and procedures that reflect the highest level of ethical business practices. our corporate governance guidelines provide the framework for our business operations and emphasize our commitment to increase stockholder value while meeting all applicable legal requirements. these guidelines meet the listing standards adopted by the new york stock exchange and are available on the internet at www.welltower.com/investors/governance. the information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10-k, and our web address is included as an inactive textual reference only.
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash our primary sources of cash include resident fees and services, rent and interest receipts, interest earned on short-term deposits, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, public issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses. depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash. these sources and uses of cash are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and are discussed in further detail below. the following is a summary of our sources and uses of cash flows for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

operating activities  please see "results of operations" for discussion of net income fluctuations. for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, cash flows provided from operations exceeded cash distributions to stockholders.
investing activities  the changes in net cash provided from/used in investing activities are primarily attributable to net changes in real property investments and dispositions, loans receivable and investments in unconsolidated entities, which are summarized above in "key transactions." please refer to notes 3 and 5 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information. the following is a summary of cash used in non-acquisition capital improvement activities for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):
recurring capital expenditures, tenant improvements and lease commissions                       199,359                            198,576          783                                        -   %                 99,994               98,582                      99   %        99,365                      99   %

the change in new development is primarily due to the number and size of construction projects on-going during the relevant periods. renovations, redevelopments and other capital improvements include expenditures to maximize property value, increase net operating income, maintain a market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization. the increase in overall development and recurring capital expenditures, tenant improvements and lease commissions is due primarily to portfolio growth and increased spending after a contraction during the pandemic.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financing activities  the changes in net cash provided from/used in financing activities are primarily attributable to changes related to our long-term debt arrangements, the issuances of common stock and dividend payments which are summarized above in "key transactions." please refer to notes 10, 11 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

capital structure please refer to "credit strength" above for a discussion of our leverage and coverage ratio trends. our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. certain agreements require us to maintain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. as of december 31, 2023, we were in compliance in all material respects with the covenants under our debt agreements. none of our debt agreements contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. however, under our primary unsecured credit facility, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used to determine the fees and interest charged. we plan to manage the company to maintain compliance with our debt covenants and with a capital structure consistent with our current profile. any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.

a portion of our earnings are derived primarily from long-term investments with predictable rates of return. these investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity, senior unsecured notes, secured debt and borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility. during inflationary periods, which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates, our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs.

resident fees and services and property operating expenses for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to acquisitions outpacing dispositions. additionally, our seniors housing operating revenues are dependent on occupancy and rate growth, both of which have continued to steadily increase during 2023. average occupancy is as follows:
(1) average occupancy includes our minority ownership share related to unconsolidated properties and excludes the minority partners' noncontrolling ownership share related to consolidated properties. also excludes land parcels and properties under development.
effective on april 1, 2022, our leasehold interest relating to the master lease with national health investors, inc. ("nhi") for 17 properties assumed in conjunction with the holiday retirement acquisition was terminated as a result of the transition or sale of the properties by nhi. the lease termination was part of an agreement to resolve outstanding litigation with nhi. in conjunction with the agreement, a wholly owned subsidiary and the lessee on the master lease agreed to release $6,883,000 of cash to the landlord, which represents the net cash flow generated from the properties since we assumed the leasehold interest. additionally, in connection with the lease termination, during the year ended december 31, 2022 we recognized $58,621,000 in other income on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income, from the derecognition of the right of use asset and related lease liability.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a summary of our ssnoi at welltower's share for the seniors housing operating segment (dollars in thousands):
(1) relates to 647 properties for the qtd pool and 556 properties for the ytd pool. please see non-gaap financial measures for additional information and reconciliations.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, we recorded impairment charges of $14,315,000 related to four held for sale properties for which the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value less costs to sell and $10,684,000 related to three held for use properties for which the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recorded impairment charges of $13,146,000 related to one held for sale property. transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as a component of the purchase price. the fluctuation in other expenses is primarily due to the timing of noncapitalizable transaction costs associated with acquisitions and operator transitions. changes in the gain on sales of properties are related to the volume and timing of property sales and the sales prices.
depreciation and amortization fluctuates as a result of acquisitions, disposition and transitions. to the extent we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, we completed ten seniors housing operating construction conversions representing $463,644,000 or $306,846 per unit. the following is a summary of our consolidated seniors housing operating construction projects in process, excluding expansions (dollars in thousands):

interest expense represents secured debt interest expense, which fluctuates based on the net effect and timing of assumptions, segment transitions, fluctuations in foreign currency rates, extinguishments and principal amortizations. the fluctuations in loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt is primarily attributable to the volume of extinguishments and terms of the related secured debt.
the following is a summary of our seniors housing operating segment property secured debt principal activity (dollars in thousands):
the majority of our seniors housing operating properties are formed through partnership interests. income or loss from unconsolidated entities represents our share of net income or losses from partnerships where we are the noncontrolling partner. income from unconsolidated entities during the year ended december 31, 2023 includes other than temporary impairment charges of $35,293,000, primarily related to unconsolidated management companies. net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners' share of net income (loss) related to joint ventures.

rental income has increased primarily due to acquisitions and annual rent increases. certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant's properties. these escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. if gross operating revenues at our facilities and/or the consumer price index do not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. for the year ended december 31, 2023, we had 87 leases with rental rate increases ranging from 0.58% to 549.38% in our triple-net portfolio.
these increases are partially offset by the write off of straight-line rent receivable balances of $16,642,000 during the year ended december 31, 2023, which relate to leases for which the collection of substantially all contractual lease payments was no longer deemed probable.
as part of the substantial exit of the genesis healthcare operating relationship, which we disclosed on march 2, 2021, we transitioned the sublease of a portfolio of seven facilities from genesis healthcare to complete care management in the second quarter of 2021. as part of the march 2021 transaction, we entered into a forward sale agreement for the seven properties valued at $182,618,000, which was expected to close when the welltower-held purchase option became exercisable. as of march 31, 2023, the right of use assets related to the properties were $115,359,000 and were reflected as held for sale with the corresponding lease liabilities of $66,530,000 on our consolidated balance sheet. on may 1, 2023, we executed a series of transactions that included the assignment of the leasehold interest to a newly formed tri-party unconsolidated joint venture with aurora health network, peace capital (an affiliate of complete care management) and us, and culminated with the closing of the purchase option by the joint venture. the transactions resulted in net cash proceeds to us of $104,240,000 after our retained interest of $11,571,000 in the joint venture and a gain from the loss of control and derecognition of the leasehold interest of $65,485,000, which we recorded in other income within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income during the year ended december 31, 2023.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a summary of our ssnoi at welltower's share for the triple-net segment (dollars in thousands):
(1) relates to 364 properties for the qtd pool and 364 properties for the ytd pool. please see non-gaap financial measures for additional information and reconciliations.
depreciation and amortization fluctuates as a result of the acquisitions, dispositions and segment transitions of triple-net properties. to the extent we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, we recorded impairment charges of $1,086,000 for one held for sale property for which the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value less costs to sell and $10,012,000 related to two held for use properties for which the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recorded impairment charges of $3,595,000 related to two held for use properties. transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as a component of purchase price. the fluctuation in other expenses is primarily due to noncapitalizable transaction costs from acquisitions and segment transitions. changes in the gain on sales of properties are related to the volume and timing of property sales and the sales prices.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, there was one triple-net construction project completed representing $141,142,000 or $738,963 per unit.
interest expense represents secured debt interest expense and related fees. the change in secured debt interest expense is due to the net effect and timing of assumptions, segment transitions, fluctuations in foreign currency rates, extinguishments and principal amortizations. the following is a summary of our triple-net secured debt principal activity for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):
loss (gain) on derivatives and financial instruments, net is primarily attributable to the mark-to-market of the equity warrants received as part of the hc-one transactions that closed in 2021 and 2023.
a portion of our triple-net properties were formed through partnerships. income or loss from unconsolidated entities represents our share of net income or losses from partnerships where we are the noncontrolling partner. the increase in income from unconsolidated entities during the year ended december 31, 2022 is primarily related to the write off of a right of use asset and related lease liability on an unconsolidated joint venture that was restructured during the year. net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners' share of net income relating to those partnerships where we are the controlling partner.

rental income has increased due primarily to acquisitions and construction conversions that occurred during 2022 and 2023. certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index. these escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. if the consumer price index does not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. our leases could renew above or below current rental rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income. for the year ended december 31, 2023, our consolidated outpatient medical portfolio signed 512,694 square feet of new leases and 2,255,492 square feet of renewals. the weighted-average term of these leases was seven years, with a rate of $37.52 per square foot and tenant improvement and lease commission costs of $28.00 per square foot. substantially all of these leases contain an annual fixed or contingent escalation rent structure ranging from 1.0% to 28.0%.
the fluctuation in property operating expenses and depreciation and amortization are primarily attributable to acquisitions and construction conversions that occurred during 2022 and 2023. to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, these amounts will change accordingly.
(1) relates to 377 properties for the qtd pool and 366 properties for the ytd pool. please see non-gaap financial measures for additional information and reconciliations.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, no impairment charge was recorded. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recognized an impairment charge of $761,000 related to one held for use property. transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as a component of purchase price. the fluctuation in other expenses is primarily due to noncapitalizable transaction costs. changes in gains/losses on sales of properties are related to volume of property sales and the sales prices.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the increase in other income for the year ended december 31, 2023 is primarily due to interest earned on deposits. property operating expenses represent insurance costs related to our captive insurance company, which acts as a direct insurer of property level insurance coverage for our portfolio.
unsecured credit facility and commercial paper program                        6,977                           19,576             (12,599)                     -64   %                  6,759             12,817                     190   %                    218                       3   %
the change in interest expense on senior unsecured notes is due to the net effect of issuances and extinguishments, as well as the movement in foreign exchange rates and related hedge activity. please refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. the change in interest expense on our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program is due primarily to the net effect and timing of draws, paydowns and variable interest rate changes. please refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. loan expenses represent the amortization of costs incurred in connection with senior unsecured notes issuances.
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were 2.70%, 2.57% and 2.67%, respectively. the increase during the year ended december 31, 2023 is primarily driven by compensation costs associated with increased employee headcount. other expenses includes non-capitalizable legal expenses, including related to our umbrella partnership reit reorganization during 2022. the provision for income taxes primarily relates to state taxes, foreign taxes and taxes based on income generated by entities that are structured as taxable reit subsidiaries.
other non-gaap financial measures we believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders, as defined by u.s. gaap, are the most appropriate earnings measurements. however, we consider ffo, noi, ssnoi, ebitda and adjusted ebitda to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with u.s. gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. however, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. in response, the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") created funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ("ffo") as a supplemental measure of operating performance for reits that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. ffo, as defined by nareit, means nics, computed in accordance with u.s. gaap, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairment of depreciable assets, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests.
noi is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties. we define noi as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing tenants for our properties. these expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees paid to managers, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance. general and administrative expenses represent general overhead costs that are unrelated to property operations and unallocable to the properties. these expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits related to corporate employees, professional services, office expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets. same store noi ("ssnoi") is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. we believe the drivers of property level noi for both consolidated properties and unconsolidated properties are generally the same and therefore, we evaluate ssnoi based on our ownership interest in each property ("welltower share"). to arrive at welltower's share, noi is adjusted by adding our minority ownership share related to unconsolidated properties and by subtracting the minority partners' noncontrolling ownership interests for consolidated properties. we do not control investments in unconsolidated properties and while we consider disclosures at welltower share to be useful, they may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our joint venture arrangements and should be used with caution. as used herein, same store is generally defined as those revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the relevant year-over-year reporting periods. acquisitions and development conversions are included in ssnoi five full quarters or eight full quarters after acquisition or being placed into service for the qtd pool and the ytd pool, respectively. land parcels, loans and sub-leases, as well as any properties sold or classified as held for sale during the respective periods are excluded from ssnoi. redeveloped properties (including major refurbishments of a seniors housing operating property item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where 20% or more of units are simultaneously taken out of commission for 30 days or more or outpatient medical properties undergoing a change in intended use) are excluded from ssnoi until five full quarters or eight full quarters post completion of the redevelopment for the qtd pool and ytd pool, respectively. properties undergoing operator transitions and/or segment transitions are also excluded from ssnoi until five full quarters or eight full quarters post completion of the transition for the qtd pool and ytd pool, respectively. in addition, properties significantly impacted by force majeure, acts of god, or other extraordinary adverse events are excluded from ssnoi until five full quarters or eight full quarters after the properties are placed back into service for the qtd pool and ytd pool, respectively. ssnoi excludes non-cash noi and includes adjustments to present consistent ownership percentages and to translate canadian properties and u.k. properties using a consistent exchange rate. we believe noi and ssnoi provide investors relevant and useful information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. we use noi and ssnoi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties.
ebitda is defined as earnings (net income) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda excluding unconsolidated entities and including adjustments for stock-based compensation expense, provision for loan losses, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt, gains/loss/impairments on properties, gains/losses on derivatives and financial instruments, other expenses, other impairment charges and other adjustments as deemed appropriate. we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda, along with net income, are important supplemental measures because they provide additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. we primarily use these measures to determine our interest coverage ratio, which represents ebitda and adjusted ebitda divided by total interest, and our fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents ebitda and adjusted ebitda divided by fixed charges. fixed charges include total interest and secured debt principal amortization. covenants in our unsecured senior notes and primary credit facility contain financial ratios based on a definition of ebitda and adjusted ebitda that is specific to those agreements. our leverage ratios are defined as the proportion of net debt to total capitalization and include book capitalization, undepreciated book capitalization and market capitalization. book capitalization represents the sum of net debt (defined as total long-term debt, excluding operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash), total equity and redeemable noncontrolling interests. undepreciated book capitalization represents book capitalization adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization. market capitalization represents book capitalization adjusted for the fair market value of our common stock.
our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions. additionally, these measures are utilized by the board of directors to evaluate management. none of our supplemental measures represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with u.s. gaap and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. finally, the supplemental measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies.

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. management considers an accounting estimate or assumption critical if:
•the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and
•the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors. management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future. however, since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, they bear the risk of change. if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. please refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us and for the impact of new accounting standards, including accounting pronouncements that were issued but not yet adopted by us.

assessing impairment of real property owned and investments in unconsolidated entities involves subjectivity in determining if indicators of impairment are present and in estimating the future undiscounted cash flows or estimated fair value of an asset. this evaluation of indicators of impairment is dependent on a number of factors including when there is an event or adverse change in the operating performance of the property, or a change in management's intent to hold and operate the property. if an indicator of impairment of the property is identified, management estimates whether the carrying value is recoverable using observable and unobservable inputs such as historical and forecasted cash flows and estimated capitalization rates, all of which are affected by our expectations of future market or economic conditions. these inputs can have a significant impact on the undiscounted cash flows.        we also evaluate investments in unconsolidated entities for indicators of impairment and, when present, record impairment charges based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value if the decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is other-than-temporary.
the evaluation of indicators of impairment of investments in unconsolidated entities is dependent on a number of factors including the performance of each investment, a change in market conditions or a change in management's investment strategy. when required, we estimate the fair value of an investment and assess whether any impairment is other than temporary using observable and unobservable inputs such as historical and forecasted cash flows and estimated capitalization rates. these inputs can have a significant impact on the calculation of the fair value of the investment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            at december 31, 2023, our net real property owned was approximately $37,063,357,000 and investments in unconsolidated entities totaled $1,636,531,000. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we recorded impairment charges of $15,401,000 related to two seniors housing operating properties and one triple-net property which were classified as held for sale for which the carrying values exceeded the fair values less costs to sell. additionally, we recorded $20,696,000 of impairment charges related to three seniors housing operating properties and two triple-net properties that were held for use in which the carrying values exceeded the estimated fair values. we recorded $35,293,000 of impairment losses related to investments in unconsolidated entities.

we believe that substantially all of our real estate acquisitions are considered asset acquisitions for which we record the related real estate acquired (tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities) at cost on a relative fair value basis. liabilities assumed and any associated noncontrolling interests are reflected at fair value. tangible assets consist primarily of land, building and improvements. identifiable intangible assets and liabilities primarily consist of the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place leases. the total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship values based on management's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with respect to that tenant.        during the year ended december 31, 2023, we disbursed $3,558,266,000 of cash related to real estate acquisitions. these transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions and the purchase price of each was allocated based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level believed adequate to absorb potential losses in our loans receivable. the determination of the credit allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of all outstanding loans, including general economic conditions and estimated collectability of loan payments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       during the year ended december 31, 2023, we recognized provision for loan losses of $9,809,000, which includes changes in the reserve based on our historical loss experience.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all statements in this section, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements that are inherently uncertain. see "disclosures regarding forward-looking statements" and item 1a. risk factors for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. the following information concerning our business, results of operations and financial condition should also be read in conjunction with the information included under item 1. business, item 1a. risk factors and item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
executive summary business update for the year ended december 31, 2023, our results were impacted by market prices and seasonal market fluctuations; however, the demand environment in which our business operates remains strong. global energy markets continue to experience disruptions resulting from regional conflicts, such as in the middle east and ukraine. we are unable to predict the potential effects that the continuance or escalation of these military conflicts, and related sanctions or market disruptions on shipping and energy costs, may have on our financial position and results. it remains uncertain how long these conditions may last or how severe they may become.
in june 2023, the provisions of california legislature adopted sbx 1-2 became effective, which authorizes the cec to establish a "maximum gross gasoline refining margin" with respect to refining activities in california, as well as establish fees for refiners for exceeding the yet to be issued margin cap. the law further expands on existing reporting requirements for refiners to the cec. in late 2023, the cec adopted (i) an order requiring an informational proceeding on a maximum gross gasoline refining margin and penalty under sbx 1-2, and (ii) an order initiating rulemaking activity under sbx 1-2 that will be focused on refinery maintenance and turnarounds. we will evaluate the impact that sbx1-2 and any associated forthcoming cec regulations may have on our current or anticipated future operations in california and results of operations when sbx 1-2 is fully implemented.
in response to the current business environment, we continue to focus on the following priorities for our business:
strengthen competitive position of assets we are committed to positioning our assets so that we are a leader in operational, financial, and sustainability performance and are evaluating the strength and fit of assets in our portfolio. our goal is that each individual asset generates free-cash-flow back to the business and contributes to shareholder returns. with our investments, we are focused on high returning projects that we believe will enhance the competitiveness of our portfolio, including our investments in sustainable fuels and technologies that lower our carbon intensity as the global energy mix evolves.
improve commercial performance we are focused on leveraging advantaged raw material selection, new approaches in the commercial space to be more dynamic amidst changing market conditions and achieving technology improvements to advance our commercial performance. a near-term focus has been securing advantaged renewable feedstocks as we continue to advance our renewable fuels production capabilities. this includes exploring joint venture opportunities and strategic alliances within the renewable fuels value chain.
continued capital discipline and focus on low-cost culture we are committed to achieving operational excellence by reducing costs, improving efficiency, driving operational improvements and being disciplined in capital allocation. this means lowering our costs in all aspects of our business and challenging ourselves to be disciplined in every dollar we spend across our organization. we look to optimize our portfolio of investment opportunities to ensure efficient deployment of capital focusing on projects with the highest returns.
commitment to sustainability our approach to sustainability spans the environmental, social and governance dimensions of our business. that means strengthening resiliency by lowering the carbon intensity and conserving natural resources; innovating for the future by investing in renewables and emerging technologies; and embedding sustainability in decision-making and in how we engage our people and many stakeholders. specifically, in 2022, we were the first among u.s. independent refiners to establish a 2030 target to reduce absolute scope 3 - category 11 ghg emissions. this goal added to our existing targets for reducing scope 1 & 2 ghg emissions intensity, for lowering methane emissions intensity and for lowering our freshwater withdrawal intensity. additionally, mplx is progressing towards meeting its 2025 and 2030 methane intensity reduction goals, as well as its biodiversity target, by applying sustainable landscapes to its compatible right of ways.
strategic updates mplx acquisition of 40 percent interest in gathering and processing joint venture on december 15, 2023, mplx used $303 million of cash on hand to purchase the remaining 40 percent interest in markwest torñado gp, l.l.c. ("torñado") for approximately $270 million, including cash paid for working capital, and to extend the term of a gathering and processing agreement for approximately $33 million. as a result of this transaction, mplx now owns 100 percent of torñado and reflects it as a consolidated subsidiary within our consolidated financial results. it was previously accounted for as an equity method investment. torñado provides natural gas gathering and processing related services in the permian basin.
at december 15, 2023, the carrying value of mplx's 60 percent equity investment in torñado was $311 million. upon acquisition of the remaining 40 percent member interest, mplx's existing equity investment was remeasured to fair value resulting in the recognition of a $92 million gain.
green bison soy processing llc facility ("green bison soy processing")
in november 2023, green bison soy processing, a dedicated soybean processing complex, opened in spiritwood, north dakota. the facility is north dakota's first dedicated soybean processing complex, and is a major step towards meeting increased demand for renewable fuels, in this case renewable green diesel. green bison soy processing will source and process local soybeans, with the resulting oil supplied exclusively to mpc as a feedstock for renewable fuels. the facility will produce approximately 600 million pounds of refined soybean oil annually, enough feedstock for approximately 75 million gallons of renewable green diesel per year. the approximately $350 million complex, which features state-of-the-art automation technology, is in the commissioning and startup phase of processing soybeans for meal and oil. the facility is a joint venture with adm owning 75 percent and mpc owning 25 percent.
south texas gateway terminal llc on august 1, 2023, mpc sold its 25 percent interest in south texas gateway terminal llc ("south texas gateway") to an affiliate of gibson energy inc. ("gibson energy"). gibson energy paid $1.1 billion in cash to acquire 100 percent of the membership interests of south texas gateway from mpc and its other members. south texas gateway owns an oil export facility in the u.s. gulf coast. mpc's proceeds were $270 million, resulting in a gain of $106 million.
lf bioenergy acquisition on march 8, 2023, mpc announced the acquisition of a 49.9 percent equity interest in lf bioenergy, an emerging producer of rng in the u.s., for approximately $56 million, which included funding for on-going operations and project development. lf bioenergy has been focused on developing and growing a portfolio of dairy farm-based, low carbon intensity rng projects. current projects are under various stages of development, with the first facility reaching full commercial operation in the first half of 2023. lf bioenergy's management and origination teams continue to expand the portfolio with additional sanctioned projects while progressing their existing pipeline of opportunities toward final investment decisions. as specific project milestones are achieved, mpc is expected to fund its share of capital expenditures to build out the portfolio.
martinez renewables joint venture the martinez renewables facility, which has a design capacity of 730 million gallons per year including pretreatment capabilities, began ramping up production of renewable diesel in 2023.
share repurchase authorization on october 25, 2023, mpc announced that our board of directors approved an additional $5.0 billion share repurchase authorization in addition to the $5.0 billion share authorizations announced on january 31, 2023 and may 2, 2023. as of december 31, 2023, mpc had $6.78 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorizations. future repurchases under the authorizations will depend on the macro environment, cash available after opportunities for capital investment and growth of the business and market conditions. the authorizations have no expiration date.
other succession planning as previously disclosed, mpc maintains a mandatory retirement policy that, absent a waiver or extension, requires an executive officer to retire from service to the company coincident with, or immediately following, the first of the month after such executive officer reaches age 65 (the "policy"). michael j. hennigan, our chief executive officer, will reach mandatory retirement on august 1, 2024. accordingly, the mpc board of directors, with a focus on the long-term strategic direction of the company, is engaged in appropriate succession planning activities, which are expected to include, among other customary steps, the review of succession candidates, as well as consideration of any waiver or extension of the policy respecting mr. hennigan.

mplx we received limited partner distributions of $2.06 billion and $1.87 billion from mplx during 2023 and 2022, respectively. we owned approximately 647 million mplx common units at december 31, 2023 with a market value of $23.77 billion based on the december 29, 2023 closing unit price of $36.72. on january 24, 2024, mplx declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.8500 per common unit, which was paid february 14, 2024. as a result, mplx made distributions totaling $853 million to its common unitholders. mpc's portion of these distributions was approximately $550 million.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, no mplx units were repurchased. as of december 31, 2023, $846 million remained available under the authorization for future repurchases.
on february 9, 2023, mplx issued $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.00 percent senior notes due 2033 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.65 percent senior notes due 2053 in an underwritten public offering.
on february 15, 2023, mplx redeemed all of the 600,000 outstanding series b preferred units at the redemption price of $1,000 per unit. the semi-annual distribution due to series b unitholders on february 15, 2023, was also paid on that date, in the usual manner. on march 13, 2023, mplx redeemed all of mplx's and markwest's $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.50 percent senior notes due july 2023.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 6 for additional information on mplx.
overview of segments refining & marketing refining & marketing segment adjusted ebitda depends largely on our refinery throughputs, refining & marketing margin, refining operating costs and distribution costs. our total refining capacity was 2,950 mbpcd, 2,898 mbpcd and 2,887 mbpcd as of december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
refining & marketing margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. as a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate gulf coast, mid-continent and west coast crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. the following are used for these crack-spread calculations:
the following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual refining & marketing segment adjusted ebitda due to potential changes in market conditions.
blended crack spread sensitivity(a) (per $1.00/barrel change)                    $1,080
sour differential sensitivity(b) (per $1.00/barrel change)                          500
sweet differential sensitivity(c) (per $1.00/barrel change)                         500
natural gas price sensitivity(d) (per $1.00/mmbtu)                                  330
(a)crack spread based on 40 percent meh, 40 percent wti and 20 percent ans with gulf coast, mid-continent and west coast product pricing, respectively, and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged.
in addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sour differential and the sweet differential, our refining & marketing margin is impacted by factors such as:
•the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk;
•the cost of purchasing rins in the open market to comply with rfs2 requirements.
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are stated under the lifo inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. at december 31, 2023, market values for refined products exceed their cost basis and, therefore, there is no lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve at the end of the year. based on movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings. such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover.
refining & marketing segment adjusted ebitda is also affected by changes in refining operating costs in addition to committed distribution costs. changes in operating costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. distribution costs primarily include long-term agreements with mplx, which as discussed below include minimum commitments to mplx, and will negatively impact segment adjusted ebitda in periods when throughput or sales are lower or refineries are idled.
we have various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with mplx. under these agreements, mplx, which is reported in our midstream segment, provides transportation, storage, distribution and marketing services to our refining & marketing segment. certain of these agreements include commitments for minimum quarterly throughput and distribution volumes of crude oil and refined products and minimum storage volumes of crude oil, refined products and other products. certain other agreements include commitments to pay for 100 percent of available capacity for certain marine transportation and refining logistics assets.
midstream our midstream segment gathers, transports, stores and distributes crude oil, refined products, including renewable diesel, and other hydrocarbon-based products, principally for our refining & marketing segment. additionally, the segment markets refined products. the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. the profitability of our marine operations primarily depends on the quantity and availability of our vessels and barges. the profitability of our light product terminal operations primarily depends on the throughput volumes at these terminals. the profitability of our fuels distribution services primarily depends on the sales volumes of certain refined products. the profitability of our refining logistics operations depends on the quantity and availability of our refining logistics assets. a majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our pipelines and marine vessels and the refined product throughput at our terminals serve our refining & marketing segment and our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services are used solely by our refining & marketing segment. as discussed above in the refining & marketing section, mplx, which is reported in our midstream segment, has various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements related to services provided to our refining & marketing segment. under these agreements, mplx has received various commitments of minimum throughput, storage and distribution volumes as well as commitments to pay for all available capacity of certain assets. the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines, terminals and marine operations. key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. the volume of refined products that we transport, store, distribute and market is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines and marine operations. in most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from may through september of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. as with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.
our midstream segment also gathers, processes and transports natural gas and transports, fractionates, stores and markets ngls. ngl and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand, as well as market uncertainty, availability of ngl transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. our midstream segment profitability is affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third‐party processing plants, purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‐related prices and the cost of third‐party transportation and fractionation services. to the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by our producer customers, such prices also affect profitability.
results of operations the following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to our results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. this discussion should be read in conjunction with item 8. financial statements and supplementary data and is intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations, but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance.

•increased income from equity method investments of $87 million largely due to increased income from midstream equity affiliates, partially offset by decreased income from refining & marketing equity affiliates;
•decreased net gains on disposal of assets of $844 million mainly due to gains of $549 million on the formation of the martinez renewables joint venture and $509 million on a lease reclassification in 2022, partially offset by the $106 million gain on the sale of mpc's 25 percent interest in south texas gateway and $92 million associated with the remeasurement of mplx's existing equity investment in torñado, arising from the acquisition of the remaining 40 percent interest in 2023; and
net interest and other financial costs decreased $475 million largely due to increased interest income, primarily on short-term investments, and decreased pension non-service costs, partially offset by increased interest expense due to higher mplx borrowings. we capitalized interest of $60 million in 2023 and $104 million in 2022. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 12 for further details.
we recorded a combined federal, state and foreign income tax expense of $2.82 billion for the year ended december 31, 2023, which was lower than the tax computed at the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to permanent tax benefits related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by state taxes. we recorded a combined federal, state and foreign income tax expense of $4.49 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, which was higher than the tax computed at the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to state taxes, partially offset by permanent tax benefits related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $49 million mainly due to mplx's redemption of its outstanding series b preferred units on february 15, 2023.
•increased income from equity method investments of $197 million largely due to increased income from midstream equity affiliates;
•increased selling, general and administrative expenses of $235 million mainly due to increased salaries, benefits and employee related expenses, credit card processing fees, contract services and insurance; and
net interest and other financial costs decreased $483 million largely due to increased interest income, decreased debt retirement expenses related to the redemption of mpc senior notes in 2021, decreased interest expense due to lower mpc borrowings and decreased pension and other postretirement non-service costs, partially offset by increased interest expense due to higher mplx borrowings. we capitalized interest of $104 million in 2022 and $73 million in 2021. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 12 for further details.
we recorded a combined federal, state and foreign income tax expense of $4.49 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, which was higher than the tax computed at the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to state taxes, partially offset by permanent tax benefits related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. we recorded a combined federal, state and foreign income tax expense of $264 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, which was lower than the tax computed at the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to certain permanent tax benefits related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and a change in benefit related to the net operating loss carryback provided under the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act, partially offset by state taxes. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 13 for further details.
segment results we classify our business in the following reportable segments: refining & marketing and midstream. segment adjusted ebitda represents adjusted ebitda attributable to the reportable segments. amounts included in income before income taxes and excluded from segment adjusted ebitda include: (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) net interest and other financial costs; (iii) turnaround expenses and (iv) other adjustments as deemed necessary. these items are either: (i) believed to be non-recurring in nature; (ii) not believed to be allocable or controlled by the segment; or (iii) are not tied to the operational performance of the segment.
our segment adjusted ebitda for reportable segments was approximately $19.72 billion, $25.03 billion and $8.93 billion for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the following shows the percentage of segment adjusted ebitda by segment for the last three years.

(a)the blended crack spreads for 2023, 2022 and 2021 are weighted 40 percent of the usgc crack spread, 40 percent of the mid-continent crack spread and 20 percent of the west coast crack spread. these blends are based on mpc's refining capacity by region in each period.
refinery crude oil capacity utilization was 92 percent during 2023 and net refinery throughput decreased 37 mbpd in 2023.
refining & marketing segment adjusted ebitda decreased $5.71 billion primarily driven by decreased per barrel margin and throughput, increased distribution costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, partially offset by increased other income and decreased refining operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization.
refining & marketing margin, excluding lifo inventory adjustments, was $23.16 per barrel for 2023 compared to $28.10 per barrel for 2022. refining & marketing margin is affected by the market indicators shown earlier, which use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales. based on the market indicators and our crude oil throughput, we estimate a net negative impact of approximately $6 billion on refining & marketing margin, primarily due to lower crack spreads. our reported refining & marketing margin differs from market indicators due to the mix of crudes purchased and their costs, the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, rin prices on the crack spread and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, direct dealer fuel margin, and for 2023, a lifo inventory charge of $145 million and for 2022, a lifo inventory credit of $148 million. these factors had an estimated net positive impact on refining & marketing segment adjusted ebitda of approximately $700 million in 2023 compared to 2022.
refining planned turnaround costs increased $79 million, or $0.09 per barrel, due to the scope and timing of turnaround activity.
we purchase rins to satisfy a portion of our rfs2 compliance. our expenses associated with purchased rins were $2.07 billion in 2023 and $2.40 billion in 2022, including benefits related to retroactive changes in renewable volume obligation requirements, and are included in refining & marketing margin. the decrease in 2023 was primarily due to increased rins acquired with purchased product from third parties and through rins generated and acquired from our martinez renewables joint venture in addition to lower average rins prices.
refinery crude oil capacity utilization was 96 percent during 2022 and net refinery throughputs increased 152 mbpd primarily due to continuing recovery in demand for our products across all our regions.
refining & marketing segment adjusted ebitda increased $15.74 billion primarily driven by higher per barrel margins, partially offset by increased refining operating costs and distribution costs, both excluding depreciation and amortization.
refining & marketing margin, excluding lifo inventory credit of $148 million, was $28.10 per barrel for 2022 compared to $13.36 per barrel for 2021. refining & marketing margin is affected by the market indicators shown earlier, which use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales. based on the market indicators and our crude oil throughput, we estimate a net positive impact of approximately $18 billion on refining & marketing margin, primarily due to higher crack spreads. our reported refining & marketing margin differs from market indicators due to the mix of crudes purchased and their costs, the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, rin prices on the crack spread and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, direct dealer fuel margin, and for 2022, a lifo inventory credit of $148 million. these factors had an estimated net negative impact on refining & marketing segment adjusted ebitda of approximately $1.5 billion in 2022 compared to 2021.
for the year ended december 31, 2022, refining operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization and storm impacts, were $5.83 billion. this was an increase of $708 million, or $0.39 per barrel, compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in energy costs largely as a result of higher natural gas and electricity prices.
refining planned turnaround costs increased $540 million, or $0.47 per barrel, due to the scope and timing of turnaround activity.
we purchase rins to satisfy a portion of our rfs2 compliance. our expenses associated with purchased rins were $2.40 billion in 2022 and $1.49 billion in 2021, including benefits related to retroactive changes in renewable volume obligation requirements, and are included in refining & marketing margin. the increase in 2022 was primarily due to higher weighted average rin costs and an increase in rin obligations due to higher production.

midstream segment adjusted ebitda increased $399 million. sales and operating revenues decreased $82 million mainly due to lower ngl prices, partially offset by rate escalations and higher throughput. this decrease was more than offset by lower purchased product costs of $465 million, primarily due to lower ngl prices of $917 million, partially offset by higher volumes of $405 million, an increase of $47 million due to changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a natural gas purchase commitment and an increase in income from equity method investments of approximately $111 million.
midstream segment revenue and segment adjusted ebitda increased $971 million and $362 million, respectively. results largely benefited from higher product pricing, mainly due to increased average c2 + ngl prices of $0.16 per gallon. these price increases resulted in higher revenues of approximately $380 million, as well as higher cost of sales of $315 million. the midstream segment also benefited from higher gathering system throughputs, resulting in increased revenue of $356 million, in addition to higher pipeline and terminal throughputs. segment adjusted ebitda increased primarily due to income from equity method investments of approximately $211 million.

non-gaap financial measure management uses a financial measure to evaluate our operating performance that is calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with gaap. the non-gaap financial measure we use is as follows:
refining & marketing margin refining & marketing margin is defined as sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs and purchased products. we use and believe our investors use this non-gaap financial measure to evaluate our refining & marketing segment's operating and financial performance as it is the most comparable measure to the industry's market reference product margins. this measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, refining & marketing gross margin or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap, and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

capital resources mpc, excluding mplx we control mplx through our ownership of the general partner; however, the creditors of mplx do not have recourse to mpc's general credit through guarantees or other financial arrangements, except as noted. mpc has effectively guaranteed certain indebtedness of loop and locap, in which mplx holds an interest. therefore, in the following table, we present the liquidity of mpc, excluding mplx. mplx liquidity is discussed in the following section.
our liquidity, excluding mplx, totaled $14.28 billion at december 31, 2023 consisting of:
(millions of dollars)                                                       total capacity            outstanding borrowings                 outstanding letters                       available of credit                                  capacity bank revolving credit facility                                               $5,000                   $-                                     $1                                     $4,999

(a)the committed borrowing and letter of credit issuance capacity of the trade receivables securitization facility is $100 million. in addition, the facility allows for the issuance of letters of credit in excess of the committed capacity at the discretion of the issuing banks.
because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets and a commercial paper program, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term (less than twelve months) and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.
we have a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of $2.0 billion in commercial paper outstanding, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. we do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facility. at december 31, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program.
mpc's bank revolving credit facility and trade receivables facility contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions, including financial covenants, and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of a similar type and nature. as of december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with such covenants and restrictions. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 20 for further discussion of mpc's revolving bank credit facility, trade receivables facility and related covenants and restrictions.
our intention is to maintain an investment-grade credit profile. as of february 1, 2024, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt are as follows.
fitch                         bbb (stable outlook)
the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our securities. although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment-grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. a rating from one rating agency should be evaluated independently of ratings from other rating agencies.
the agreements governing mpc's debt obligations do not contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. however, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt could increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under such agreements and may limit our flexibility to obtain financing in the future, including to refinance existing indebtedness. in addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment-grade levels could, under certain circumstances, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services or other agreements.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 20 for further discussion of our debt.
mplx mplx's liquidity totaled $4.55 billion at december 31, 2023 consisting of:

the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell or hold mplx securities. although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment-grade rating for mplx, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. a rating from one rating agency should be evaluated independently of ratings from other rating agencies.
the agreements governing mplx's debt obligations do not contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that mplx credit ratings are downgraded. however, any downgrades of mplx senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings could increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under such agreements. in addition, a downgrade of mplx senior unsecured debt ratings to below investment-grade levels may limit mplx's ability to obtain future financing, including to refinance existing indebtedness.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 20 for further discussion of mplx's debt.
capital requirements capital spending mpc's capital investment plan for 2024 totals approximately $1.25 billion for capital projects and investments, excluding capitalized interest, potential acquisitions, if any, and mplx's capital investment plan. mpc's 2024 capital investment plan includes all of the planned capital spending for refining & marketing and corporate as well as a portion of the planned capital investments for midstream. the remainder of the planned capital spending for midstream reflects the capital investment plan for mplx. we continuously evaluate our capital plan and make changes as conditions warrant. the 2024 capital investment plan for mpc and mplx and capital expenditures and investments for each of the last three years are summarized by segment below.

(a)capital expenditures include changes in capital accruals.
(b)excludes capitalized interest of $55 million, $103 million and $68 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the 2024 capital investment plan excludes capitalized interest.
(c)the 2024 capital investment plan for midstream - mplx excludes $285 million of capital expenditures, which is expected to be incurred primarily by mpc and other mplx customers on mplx's behalf. it also excludes approximately $100 million for repayment of mplx's share of the bakken pipeline joint venture's debt due in 2024. this reimbursable capital and the contribution to the joint venture will be included in the 2024 mpc midstream capital expenditures.
refining & marketing the refining & marketing segment's forecasted 2024 capital spending and investments is approximately $1.20 billion. this amount includes approximately $350 million of growth capital for multi-year low carbon initiatives. at our los angeles refinery, we are advancing improvements to enhance the competitiveness of the refinery by improving reliability and lowering costs. the improvements focus on integrating and modernizing utility systems and increasing energy efficiency, with the added benefit of addressing upcoming regulation mandating further reductions in emissions. the improvements are expected to be completed by the end of 2025. there is also $475 million of growth capital which includes a multi-year project to upgrade high sulfur distillate to ulsd and maximize distillate volume expansion at our galveston bay refinery, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2027, and other traditional projects that will enhance the yields of our refineries, improve energy efficiency, and lower our costs as well as investments in our branded marketing footprint. maintenance capital is expected to be approximately $375 million which is essential to maintain the safety, integrity and reliability of our assets.
major capital projects completed over the last three years have focused on refinery optimization, production of higher value products, increased capacity to upgrade residual fuel oil and expanded export capacity. we also focused on projects such as the martinez facility conversion, the star project at our galveston bay refinery and projects expected to reduce future operating costs.
midstream mplx's capital investment plan of $1.10 billion, net of reimbursements, includes approximately $950 million of organic growth capital and $150 million of maintenance capital. this excludes approximately $100 million for the repayment of mplx's share of the bakken pipeline joint venture's debt due in 2024. mplx's growth capital plans are anchored in the marcellus, permian, and bakken basins. in addition to new gas processing plants in the marcellus and permian, the remainder of mplx's capital plan is focused on other investments targeted at the expansion or debottlenecking of existing assets to meet customer demand.
major capital projects over the last three years included investments for the development of natural gas and natural gas liquids infrastructure to support mplx's producer customers, primarily in the marcellus, utica and permian regions and development of various crude oil and refined petroleum products infrastructure projects.
corporate and other the 2024 capital forecast includes approximately $50 million to support corporate and other activities. major projects over the last three years included upgrades to information technology systems.
share repurchases from january 1, 2012 through december 31, 2023, our board of directors approved $50.05 billion in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of $43.27 billion of our common stock. as of december 31, 2023, mpc had $6.78 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorizations, which reflects the repurchase of 489,190 common shares for $73 million that were transacted in the fourth quarter of 2023 and settled in the first quarter of 2024. the table below summarizes our total share repurchases. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 10 for further discussion of the share repurchase plans.
we may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, tender offers, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through rule 10b5-1 plans. the timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
mplx unit repurchases the table below summarizes mplx's total unit repurchases.
(in millions of dollars, except per unit data)        2023                         2022                    2021

as of december 31, 2023, mplx had approximately $846 million remaining under its unit repurchase authorizations. the repurchase authorizations have no expiration date.
mplx may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated unit repurchases, tender offers or open market solicitations for units, some of which may be effected through rule 10b5-1 plans. the timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 6 for further discussion of the mplx unit repurchase program.
material cash commitments contractual obligations we have purchase commitments primarily consisting of obligations to purchase and transport crude oil and feedstocks used in our refining operations. as of december 31, 2023, we had purchase obligations for crude oil, ngls and renewable feedstocks of $17.76 billion, with $14.44 billion payable within 12 months, and crude oil transportation obligations of $7.45 billion, with $835 million payable within 12 months. these contracts include variable price arrangements. for purposes of this disclosure, we have estimated prices to be paid primarily based on futures curves for the commodities to the extent available. our contractual obligations do not include our contractual obligations to mplx under various fee-based commercial agreements as these transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
at december 31, 2023, we have non-cancelable obligations to acquire property, plant and equipment of $281 million, with $276 million payable within 12 months.
at december 31, 2023, we have aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes of $27.15 billion, with $1.9 billion payable within 12 months, and interest on the debt of $16.86 billion, with $1.23 billion payable within 12 months. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 20 for additional information on our debt. we intend to repay the short-term maturities with existing cash on hand and/or with the proceeds of new long-term debt, depending on, among other things, market conditions.
our other contractual obligations primarily consist of pension and post-retirement obligations, finance and operating leases and environmental credits liabilities, for which additional information is included in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes 25, 27 and 23, respectively.
other cash commitments on january 26, 2024, we announced our board of directors approved a $0.825 per share dividend, payable march 11, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on february 21, 2024.
we may, from time to time, repurchase our senior notes and preferred units in the open market, in tender offers, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in such volumes, at such prices and upon such other terms as we deem appropriate.
transactions with related parties see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 8 for discussion of activity with related parties.
environmental matters and compliance costs we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. if these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. however, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.
legislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications, climate change and ghg emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including costs of compliance and permitting delays. the extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered, the costs and the time frames for compliance, and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers.
our environmental expenditures, including non-regulatory expenditures, for each of the last three years were:
capital                                                 $236                    $167                  $118
(a)based on the american petroleum institute's definition of environmental expenditures.
we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required.
new or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed.
our environmental capital expenditures accounted for 12 percent, 7 percent and 8 percent of capital expenditures, for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, excluding acquisitions. our environmental capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $272 million, or 12 percent, of total planned capital expenditures in 2024. actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed.
for more information on environmental regulations that impact us, or could impact us, see item 1. business - regulatory matters and item 1a. risk factors.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 2 for additional information on these policies and estimates, as well as a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates.
fair value estimates fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. there are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. the income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts. the cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. this is often referred to as current replacement cost. the cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence.
the fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques. these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
•level 1 - observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
•level 2 - observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. these are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date.
•level 3 - unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value.
valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. the assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. we use an income or market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 18 for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements.
•assessment of impairment of long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and equity method investments;
•recorded values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions; and
impairment assessments of long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and equity method investments fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted financial information prepared using significant assumptions including:
•future operating performance. our estimates of future operating performance are based on our analysis of various supply and demand factors, which include, among other things, industry-wide capacity, our planned utilization rate, end-user demand, capital expenditures and economic conditions. such estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews.
•future volumes. our estimates of future refinery, pipeline throughput and natural gas and natural gas liquid processing volumes are based on internal forecasts prepared by our refining & marketing and midstream segments operations personnel. assumptions about our customers' drilling activity are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors (including future or expected crude oil and natural gas pricing considerations), many of which are difficult to forecast. management considers these volume forecasts and other factors when developing our forecasted cash flows.
•discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. we apply a discount rate to our cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. this discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions, if possible. a higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows.
•future capital requirements. these are based on authorized spending and internal forecasts.
the need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced, a weakened outlook for profitability, a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes, a significant reduction in natural gas or natural gas liquids processed, a significant reduction in refining margins, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment. the following sections detail our critical accounting estimates related to impairment assessments for long-lived assets, goodwill and equity method investments.
long-lived asset impairment assessments long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the expected undiscounted future cash flow of an asset group. for purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for refining & marketing segment assets, and the plant level or pipeline system level for midstream segment assets. if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, fair value is calculated, and the carrying value is written down to the calculated fair value.
goodwill impairment assessments unlike long-lived assets, goodwill is subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing at the reporting unit level. a goodwill impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the recorded amount of goodwill.
at december 31, 2023, mpc had four reporting units with goodwill totaling approximately $8.24 billion. the majority of this balance is comprised of the midstream reporting units, including $1.1 billion for the mplx crude gathering reporting unit and $6.6 billion for the mplx transportation & storage reporting unit. for the annual impairment assessment as of november 30, 2023, management performed only a qualitative assessment for three reporting units as we determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value. significant assumptions used to estimate the reporting units' fair value under a qualitative approach included estimates of future cash flows and market information for comparable assets. a quantitative assessment was performed for the mplx crude gathering reporting unit, which resulted in the fair value of the reporting unit exceeding its carrying value by greater than 10 percent. the fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on applying both a discounted cash flow method (i.e., income approach) as well as a market approach. an increase of one percentage point to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge as of november 30, 2023. significant assumptions that were used to estimate the crude gathering reporting unit's fair values under the discounted cash flow method included management's best estimates of the discount rate, as well as estimates of future cash flows, which are impacted primarily by producer customers' development plans, which impact the reporting unit's future volumes and capital requirements. if estimates for future cash flows were to decline, the overall reporting units' fair values would decrease, resulting in potential goodwill impairment charges. fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. as a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.
equity method investment impairment assessment equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value. factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value, absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee's inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value. at december 31, 2023, we had $6.26 billion of investments in equity method investments recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 15 for additional information on our equity method investments. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 17 for additional information on our goodwill and intangibles, including a table summarizing our recorded goodwill by segment.
derivatives we record all derivative instruments at fair value. substantially all of our commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value. fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 18. additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
variable interest entities we evaluate all legal entities in which we hold an ownership or other pecuniary interest to determine if the entity is a vie. our interests in a vie are referred to as variable interests. variable interests can be contractual, ownership or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the vie's assets. when we conclude that we hold an interest in a vie we must determine if we are the entity's primary beneficiary. a primary beneficiary is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie. this controlling financial interest is evidenced by both (a) the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie. we consolidate any vie when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary. we must disclose the nature of any interests in a vie that is not consolidated.
significant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a vie and in evaluating our interest in a vie. we use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if an entity is a vie. we evaluate the entity's need for continuing financial support; the equity holder's lack of a controlling financial interest; and/or if an equity holder's voting interests are disproportionate to its obligation to absorb expected losses or receive residual returns. we evaluate our interests in a vie to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. we use a primarily qualitative analysis to determine if we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the vie, either on a standalone basis or as part of a related party group. we continually monitor our interests in legal entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests, including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions.
changes in the design or nature of the activities of a vie, or our involvement with a vie, may require us to reconsider our conclusions on the entity's status as a vie and/or our status as the primary beneficiary. such reconsideration requires significant judgment and understanding of the organization. this could result in the deconsolidation or consolidation of the affected subsidiary, which would have a significant impact on our financial statements.
variable interest entities are discussed in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 7.
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following:
•the mortality table used in determining future plan obligations.
we utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. we have selected different discount rates for each of our pension plans and retiree health and welfare based on the projected benefit payment patterns of each individual plan. the selected rates are compared to various similar bond indexes for reasonableness. in determining the assumed discount rates, we use our third-party actuaries' discount rate models. these models calculate an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using yield curves derived from aa or higher corporate bond yields. the yield curves represent a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. the bonds used have an average rating of aa or higher from a recognized rating agency and generally only non-callable bonds are included. outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included. each issue is required to have at least $300 million par value outstanding.
of the assumptions used to measure the year-end obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. decreasing the discount rates of 4.90 percent for our pension plans and 4.80 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 0.25 percent would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $74 million and $16 million, respectively, and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by $10 million and less than $1 million, respectively.
the long-term asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 50 percent equity securities and 50 percent fixed income securities for the primary funded pension plan), past performance and other factors. certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns. in addition, our long-term asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness. we used the 7.00 percent long-term rate of return to determine our 2023 defined benefit pension expense. after evaluating activity in the capital markets, along with the current and projected plan investments, we decreased the asset rate of return for our primary plan to 6.80 percent effective for 2024. decreasing the 7.00 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 percentage points would increase our defined benefit pension expense by $5 million.
compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans.
we utilized the 2021 mortality tables from the u.s. society of actuaries.

in the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial data but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap. certain of these data are considered "non-gaap financial measures" under sec rules. see the non-gaap financial measures section for the reasons we use these non-gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures.
consolidated results summary of 2023 results. total revenues were $68.0 billion, up $9.9 billion for the year, driven by increases at all segments and corporate.
continuing earnings (loss) per share was $7.98. excluding the results from our run-off insurance operations, non-operating benefit costs, gains (losses) on purchases and sales of business interests, gains (losses) on equity securities, restructuring costs, separation costs and russia and ukraine charges, adjusted earnings per share* was $2.81. for the year ended december 31, 2023, profit margin was 15.0% and profit was up $11.0 billion, primarily due to an increase in gains on retained and sold ownership interests of $5.7 billion, an increase in segment profit of $2.4 billion, an increase in non-operating benefit income of $1.2 billion, the nonrecurrence of the steam asset sale impairment of $0.8 billion, the nonrecurrence of debt extinguishment costs of $0.5 billion, a decrease in interest and other financial charges of $0.3 billion, a decrease in adjusted total corporate operating costs* of $0.1 billion, a decrease in restructuring costs of $0.1 billion and an increase in insurance profit of $0.1 billion. these increases were partially offset by an increase in separation costs of $0.3 billion. adjusted organic profit* increased $2.6 billion, driven primarily by increases at all segments and lower adjusted total corporate operating costs*.
cash flows from operating activities (cfoa) were $5.6 billion and $4.0 billion for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. cfoa increased primarily due to an increase in net income (after adjusting for depreciation of property, plant, and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, non-cash (gains) losses related to our retained and sold ownership interests in ge healthcare, aercap and baker hughes and the nonrecurrence of non-operating debt extinguishment costs). free cash flows* (fcf) were $5.2 billion and $3.1 billion for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. fcf* increased primarily due to the same reasons as noted for cfoa above, after adjusting for an increase in separation cash expenditures, which are excluded from fcf*, partially offset by an increase in cash used for additions to property, plant and equipment and internal-use software. see the capital resources and liquidity - statement of cash flows section for further information.
remaining performance obligation (rpo) includes unfilled customer orders for equipment, excluding any purchase order that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty. services rpo includes the estimated life of contract sales related to long-term service agreements which remain unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period, the estimated amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for time and material agreements, material services agreements, spare parts under purchase order, multi-year maintenance programs and other services agreements, excluding any order that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty. see note 25 for further information.
*non-gaap financial measure
for the year ended december 31, 2023, total revenues increased $9.9 billion (17%). equipment revenues increased, primarily at renewable energy, due to higher equipment revenue at offshore wind associated with the haliade-x ramp up, as well as at grid; at aerospace, due to an increase in commercial install and spare engine unit shipments; and at power, due to increases at gas power and power conversion. services revenues increased, primarily at aerospace, due to increased commercial spare part shipments, internal shop visit volume and higher prices; and at power, due to growth in gas power, steam and power conversion; partially offset by a decrease at renewable energy, due to a decrease in repower revenue.
excluding the change in insurance revenues, the net effects of acquisitions and dispositions and the effects of a weaker u.s. dollar, organic revenues* increased $9.2 billion (17%), with equipment revenues up $4.3 billion (19%) and services revenues up $4.8 billion (15%). organic revenues* increased at aerospace, renewable energy and power.
for the year ended december 31, 2023, continuing earnings increased $9.9 billion, primarily due to an increase in gains on retained and sold ownership interests of $5.7 billion, an increase in segment profit of $2.4 billion, an increase in non-operating benefit income of $1.2 billion, the nonrecurrence of the steam asset sale impairment of $0.8 billion, the nonrecurrence of debt extinguishment costs of $0.5 billion, a decrease in interest and other financial charges of $0.3 billion, a decrease in adjusted corporate operating costs* of $0.1 billion, a decrease in restructuring costs of $0.1 billion and an increase in insurance profit of $0.1 billion. these increases were partially offset by an increase in provision for income taxes of $1.1 billion and an increase in separation costs of $0.3 billion. adjusted earnings* were $3.1 billion, an increase of $2.2 billion. profit margin was 15.0%, an increase from (1.4)%. adjusted profit* was $5.7 billion, an increase of $2.6 billion organically*, due to increases at aerospace, renewable energy and power. adjusted profit margin* was 8.8%, an increase of 310 basis points organically*.
we continue to experience inflation pressure in our supply chain, as well as delays in sourcing key materials needed for our products and skilled labor shortages. this has delayed our ability to convert rpo to revenue and negatively impacted our profit margins. while we expect the impact of inflation to continue to be challenging, we have taken and continue to take actions to limit this pressure, including lean initiatives to drive cost productivity, partnering with our suppliers and adjusting the pricing of our products and services. also, because we operate in many countries around the world, we are subject to complex global geopolitical forces. due to an expansion of u.s. sanctions related to the ongoing russia and ukraine conflict, we recorded a charge of $0.2 billion in the year ended december 31, 2023, primarily related to our power segment, and as a result our remaining net asset exposure to russia is not material.
segment operations. segment revenues include sales of equipment and services by our segments. segment profit is determined based on performance measures used by our chief operating decision maker (codm), who is our chief executive officer (ceo), to assess the performance of each business in a given period. in connection with that assessment, the ceo may exclude matters, such as charges for impairments, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, costs associated with separation activities, manufacturing footprint rationalization and other similar expenses, acquisition costs and other related charges, certain gains and losses from acquisitions or dispositions and certain litigation settlements. see the corporate section for further information about costs excluded from segment profit. segment profit excludes results reported as discontinued operations and the portion of earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and as such only includes the portion of earnings or loss attributable to our share of the consolidated earnings or loss of consolidated subsidiaries. certain corporate costs, including those related to shared services, employee benefits, and information technology, are allocated to our segments based on usage or their relative net cost of operations.

ge aerospace. aerospace designs and produces commercial and defense aircraft engines, integrated engine components, electric power and mechanical aircraft systems. we also provide aftermarket services to support our products.
commercial engines and services - manufactures jet engines for commercial airframes. aerospace engines power aircraft in all categories: narrowbody, widebody and regional, which includes engines sold by cfm international, a 50-50 non-consolidated company with safran aircraft engines, a subsidiary of safran group of france, and engine alliance, a 50-50 non-consolidated company with raytheon technologies corporation via their pratt & whitney segment. this includes engines and components for business aviation and aeroderivative applications as well. commercial provides maintenance, component repair and overhaul services (mro), including sales of spare parts.
defense - manufactures jet engines for defense airframes. our defense engines power a wide variety of defense aircraft including fighters, bombers, tankers, helicopters and surveillance aircraft, as well as marine applications. we provide maintenance, component repair and overhaul services, including sales of spare parts.
systems & other - provides avionics systems, aviation electric power systems, turboprop engines, engine gear and transmission components and services for commercial and defense businesses. additionally, we provide a wide variety of products and services including additive machines, additive materials (including metal powders), and additive engineering services.
competition & regulation. the global businesses for aircraft jet engines, maintenance, component repair and overhaul services (including spare part sales) are highly competitive. both domestic and international sales are important to the growth and success of the business. product development cycles are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success. research and development expenditures are important in this business, as are focused intellectual property strategies and protection of key aircraft engine design, manufacture, repair and product upgrade technologies. in addition, we are subject to market and regulatory dynamics related to decarbonization which will require a combination of technological innovation in the fuel efficiency of engines, expanding the use of sustainable aviation fuels and the development of electric flight and hydrogen-based aviation technologies. aircraft engine and systems orders tend to follow civil air travel demand and defense procurement cycles.
our products, services and activities are subject to a number of global regulators such as the u.s. federal aviation administration (faa), european union aviation safety agency (easa), civil aviation administration of china (caac) and other regulatory bodies.
significant trends & developments. our results in 2023 reflect robust demand for commercial air travel and continued strength in services, which represents over 70% of aerospace's revenue this year. a key underlying driver of our commercial engine and services business is global commercial departures, which grew high-teens during 2023 compared to 2022. the air traffic growth trends vary by region given economic conditions, airline competition and government regulations. consistent with industry projections, we estimate departures growth to decelerate to mid-single digits in 2024. we are in frequent dialogue with our airline, airframe, and maintenance, repair and overhaul customers about the outlook for commercial air travel, new aircraft production, fleet retirements, and after-market services, including shop visit and spare parts demand.
as it relates to the defense environment, we continue to forecast strong demand creating future growth opportunities for our defense business. the u.s. department of defense and foreign governments have continued flight operations and have allocated budgets to upgrade and modernize their existing fleets, including support for next generation large-combat engine architecture such as aerospace's xa100 program. in october 2023, aerospace achieved a significant milestone with the u.s. army's acceptance of the first two t901 flight test engines that will power the future attack reconnaissance aircraft prototypes.
we increased our commercial engine sales this year compared to prior year, however, defense engine sales decreased compared to prior year. global material availability, supplier delivery performance and skilled labor shortages continue to cause disruptions for our suppliers and for us, and have impacted our production and delivery. we continue to partner with our customers on future production rates. aerospace is proactively managing the impact of inflationary pressure by deploying lean initiatives to drive cost productivity, partnering with our suppliers and adjusting the pricing of our products and services. we expect the impact of inflation will continue, and we are taking actions to mitigate the impact.
total engineering, comprising company, customer and partner-funded and nonrecurring engineering costs, increased compared to the prior year. we remain committed to investing in developing and maturing technologies that enable a more sustainable future of flight.
notably, cfm's revolutionary innovation for sustainable engines (rise) program represents our single largest efficiency step change, aiming to reduce fuel consumption and co2 emissions by at least 20% compared to today's most efficient engines. in december 2023, nasa selected aerospace for phase two of the hybrid thermally efficient core program, which will significantly enhance fuel efficiency and reduce emissions for the next-generation of commercial aircraft engines.
we continue to take actions to serve our customers as demand in the global airline industry increases. aerospace has a deep history of innovation and technology leadership. our commercial and defense engine installed base, including units produced by joint ventures, of approximately 70,000 units, with approximately 12,600 units under long-term service agreements, supports recurring, profitable services growth for the future. we believe these strong fundamentals position aerospace to generate long-term profitable growth and higher cash flow over time.

*non-gaap financial measure
for the year ended december 31, 2023, segment revenues were up $5.7 billion (22%) and segment profit was up $1.3 billion (28%).
revenues increased $5.7 billion (22%) organically*. commercial services revenues increased, primarily due to increased commercial spare part shipments, higher internal shop visit volume, heavier work scopes and higher prices. commercial engines revenue increased, from 412 more commercial install and spare engine unit shipments, including 434 more leap units compared to the prior year. defense revenues increased, primarily due to product mix and growth in development contract revenue, partially offset by 76 fewer engine shipments than the prior year.
profit increased $1.2 billion (25%) organically*, primarily due to benefits from increased commercial spare part shipments, higher internal shop visit volume, heavier work scopes and higher prices. these increases in profit were partially offset by additional growth investment, inflation in our supply chain and product mix.
renewable energy - will be part of ge vernova. we benefit from one of the broadest portfolios in the industry that uniquely positions us to lead the energy transition while building on advanced technologies that grow renewable energy generation, lower the cost of electricity and modernize the grid. our portfolio of business units includes onshore and offshore wind, blade manufacturing, grid solutions, hydro, battery storage, hybrid renewables and digital services offerings.
onshore wind - delivers wind turbines, technology and services for the onshore wind power industry by focusing on work-horse products in select locations, while continuing to innovate the technology to create wind turbines suitable for various markets and environmental conditions. wind services assist customers in improving cost, capacity and performance of their assets over the lifetime of their fleets, utilizing digital infrastructure to monitor, predict and optimize wind farm energy performance. our onshore wind business supports a turbine installed base of over 55,000 units, of which slightly fewer than half are under service agreements.
grid solutions equipment and services (grid) - enables power utilities and industries worldwide to effectively manage electricity from the point of generation to consumption, helping the reliability, efficiency and resiliency of the grid. service offerings include a comprehensive portfolio of equipment, hardware, protection and control, automation and digital services. grid is also addressing the challenges of the energy transition by safely and reliably connecting intermittent renewable energy generation to transmission networks.
hydro, offshore wind and hybrid solutions - hydro provides a portfolio of solutions and services for hydropower generation for both large hydropower plants and small hydropower solutions. offshore wind provides wind power technologies and wind farm development. hybrid solutions provides integration of renewable energies that drive stability to the grid and integrates storage and renewable energy generation sources.
competition & regulation. while many factors, including government incentives, specific market rules, and permitting regulations and challenges affect how renewable energy can deliver outcomes for customers in a given region, renewable energy has become competitive with fossil fuels in terms of levelized cost of electricity. we continue to invest in improving the durability of our wind turbine products, fleet availability and project execution. we have an increased focus on project selectivity and reducing the number of product variants. additionally, we continue to explore ways to further improve the efficiency and flexibility of our hydropower technology with new innovative turbine designs and digital solutions. the power grid, which was designed historically for one-way flow of electricity from centralized plants, must be augmented to accommodate two-way flows from a highly distributed network of generation and storage solutions. as industry models continue to evolve, our digital strategy and investments in technical innovation will position us to add value for customers looking for clean, renewable energy.
significant trends & developments. during the year ended december 31, 2023, the segment experienced higher orders and revenue from increased demand at grid, onshore wind projects in the u.s. and higher revenue at offshore wind. grid solutions signed a significant agreement to supply its two-gigawatt hvdc systems to connect wind farms in the north sea to the netherlands and germany. the inflation reduction act of 2022 (ira) introduced new and extended existing tax incentives for at least 10 years. it has resolved recent u.s. policy uncertainty that resulted in project delays and deferral of customer investments in onshore wind and increased near- and longer-term demand in the u.s. for onshore and offshore wind projects. included in our rpo of $42.8 billion at december 31, 2023 are service agreements on approximately 24,000 of our onshore wind turbines, from an installed base of over 55,000 units. new product introductions, such as our 3 mw, 5 mw and 6 mw onshore units, and our 12-14 mw haliade-x offshore units, account for more than half of our rpo in onshore and offshore wind. as of december 31, 2023, the first 13 mw haliade-x units have achieved first power. finally, our grid business is positioned to support grid expansion and modernization needs.
at onshore wind, we continue to focus on improving our overall quality and fleet availability. we are reducing product variants and deploying repairs and other corrective measures across the fleet. concurrently, we intend to operate in fewer geographies and focus on those markets that align better with our products and manufacturing footprint. we are realizing the favorable impact of the ira through a reduction in product costs as qualifying turbines manufactured in the u.s. in 2023 are delivered. more than two-thirds of onshore wind's equipment rpo is associated with u.s. projects where we expect to receive additional ira benefits as incremental qualifying turbines are delivered. finally, we are continuing our restructuring program to reduce our operating costs and are seeing the benefits both operationally and financially.
the offshore wind industry, where we expect global growth through the coming decades, currently faces challenges as companies attempt to increase output and reduce cost. in our offshore wind business, we continue to experience pressure related to our product and project cost estimates. although we are deploying countermeasures to combat these pressures and are committed to driving productivity and cost improvement for our new larger turbines, changes in execution timelines or other adverse developments likely could have an adverse effect on our cash collection timelines and contract profitability, and could result in further losses beyond the amounts that we currently estimate.
*non-gaap financial measure
our grid solutions business is positioned to support grid expansion and modernization needs globally. we secured a position in the rapidly growing offshore interconnection market with new products and technology supporting a 2 gw high voltage direct current (hvdc) solution standard and are developing new technology, such as grid-forming static synchronous compensators and eco-friendly sf6-free switchgears, that solves for a denser, more resilient, stable and efficient electric grid; a grid with lower future greenhouse gas emissions. we also benefited from higher growth in orders from other transmission and grid automation related products within our grid solutions business.

for the year ended december 31, 2023, segment revenues were up $2.1 billion (16%) and segment losses were down $0.8 billion (36%).
revenues increased $2.1 billion (17%) organically*, primarily from higher equipment revenue at offshore wind associated with the haliade-x ramp up, increases at grid in equipment and services and increases at onshore wind equipment in north america. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in repower revenue driven by a reduction in volume.
segment losses decreased $1.0 billion (45%) organically*, primarily attributable to the improved performance at onshore wind through improved pricing and the impact of cost reduction activities, the nonrecurrence of prior year warranty and related charges of $0.5 billion and benefits arising from the ira on product cost of $0.2 billion. additionally, grid profit increased due to higher revenue, improved pricing and the impact of cost reduction activities. these benefits were partially offset by higher losses at offshore wind associated with haliade-x ramp up where project losses increased by $0.4 billion.
power - will be part of ge vernova. power serves power generation, industrial, government and other customers worldwide with products and services related to energy production. our products and technologies harness resources such as natural gas, fossil, oil, diesel and nuclear to produce electric power and include gas and steam turbines, full balance of plant, upgrade and service solutions, as well as data-leveraging software.
gas power - offers a wide spectrum of heavy-duty and aeroderivative gas turbines for utilities, independent power producers and numerous industrial applications, ranging from small, mobile power to utility scale power plants. gas power also delivers maintenance and service solutions across total plant assets and over their operational lifecycle.

*non-gaap financial measure
competition & regulation. worldwide competition for power generation products and services is intense. demand for power generation is global, and as a result, is sensitive to the economic and political environments of each country in which we do business. our products and services sold to end customers are often subject to many regulatory requirements and performance standards under different federal, state, foreign and energy industry standards. in addition, we are subject to market and other dynamics related to decarbonization, where it will remain important to lower greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come, which will likely depend in part on technologies that are not yet deployed or widely adopted today but may become more important over time (such as hydrogen-based power generation, carbon capture and sequestration technologies or small modular reactors or other advanced nuclear power).
significant trends & developments. during the year ended december 31, 2023, ge gas turbine utilization was up low single digits, with strength in the u.s. partially offset by lower utilization in europe due to nuclear and hydro recoveries as well as renewables growth. global electricity demand was down low single digits for the year due to milder temperatures in the u.s. and the continued effects of energy saving policies in europe. as we continue to work in emerging markets, there could be uncertainty in the timing of deal closures due to financing and other complexities. power has proactively managed the impact of inflationary pressure by deploying lean initiatives to drive cost productivity, partnering with our suppliers and adjusting the pricing of our products and services. given the long-cycle nature of the business, we expect the impact of inflation will continue to be challenging and we will continue to take actions to manage.
although market factors related to the energy transition, such as greater renewable energy penetration and the adoption of climate change-related policies continue to evolve, we expect the gas power market to remain stable over the next decade with gas power generation continuing to grow low single digits. we believe gas power will play a critical role in the energy transition by providing a critical foundation of dispatchable, flexible power and system inertia from which the energy transition can build upon. we remain focused on our underwriting discipline and risk management to ensure we are securing deals that meet our financial hurdles, where we have high confidence in delivering for our customers.
in the first quarter of 2022, we signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding for ge steam power to sell a part of its nuclear activities to électricité de france s.a. (edf), which resulted in a reclassification of that business to held for sale. in the fourth quarter of 2022, we signed a binding agreement to sell a portion of our steam business to edf. we are working with edf to complete the sale as soon as possible, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. in the second quarter of 2023, our gas power business acquired nexus controls, a business specializing in aftermarket control system upgrades and controls field services that is expected to strengthen our quality, service, and delivery of our customers' assets.
we continue to invest in new product development. in nuclear, we have signed an agreement with a customer for the deployment of small modular nuclear reactor technology, the first commercial contract in north america, with the potential to enable reductions in nuclear power plant costs and cycle times. in gas power, we continue to invest for the long-term, including multiple decarbonization pathways that will provide customers with cleaner, more reliable power. our fundamentals remain strong with approximately $71.7 billion in rpo and a gas turbine installed base of approximately 7,000 units and approximately 1,700 units under long-term service agreements with an average remaining contract life of 10 years. this includes 22 ha-turbines in rpo and 92 ha-turbines in the installed base with over two million operating hours.

for the year ended december 31, 2023, segment revenues were up $1.5 billion (9%) and segment profit was up $0.2 billion (19%).
revenues increased $1.2 billion (7%) organically*, primarily due to an increase in gas power equipment from higher price and scope on heavy-duty gas turbines and scope on aeroderivatives, increases in gas power and steam services and increases in power conversion services and equipment, partially offset by a reduction in steam power equipment due to the ongoing exit of new build coal.
profit increased $0.1 billion (10%) organically* primarily due to an increase in gas power services volume, price and productivity offsetting inflation.
corporate. the corporate amounts related to revenues and earnings include the results of disposed businesses, certain amounts not included in operating segment results because they are excluded from measurement of their operating performance for internal and external purposes and the elimination of intersegment activities. in addition, the corporate amounts related to earnings include certain costs of our principal retirement plans, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, separation costs, and other costs reported in corporate.
corporate includes the results of the ge digital business, the majority of which will be part of ge vernova, and our remaining financial services business, including our run-off insurance operations (see note 12 for further information).

adjusted total corporate operating costs* excludes gains (losses) on purchases and sales of business interests, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, separation costs, gains (losses) on equity securities, impairments, russia and ukraine charges and our run-off insurance operations profit. we believe that adjusting corporate costs to exclude the effects of items that are not closely associated with ongoing corporate operations provides management and investors with a meaningful measure that increases the period-to-period comparability of our ongoing corporate costs.
for the year ended december 31, 2023, revenues increased by $0.6 billion due to higher revenue in our run-off insurance operations, higher revenue in our digital business and lower intersegment eliminations. corporate operating profit increased by $6.7 billion due to $5.7 billion of higher gains on retained and sold ownership interests, primarily related to our aercap and ge healthcare investments, partially offset by the nonrecurrence of prior year gains on our baker hughes investment. corporate operating profit also increased as the result of the nonrecurrence of a $0.8 billion non-cash impairment charge related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as a result of the reclassification of a portion of our steam power business to held for sale in the first quarter of 2022 (see notes 6 and 7). corporate operating profit also increased due to $0.1 billion of lower charges from contracts and recoverability of assets in connection with the conflict between russia and ukraine and resulting sanctions, primarily related to our aerospace and power businesses. in addition, corporate operating profit increased as the result of $0.1 billion of lower restructuring and other charges and $0.1 billion of higher operating profit in our run-off insurance operations. these increases were partially offset by $0.3 billion of higher separation costs.
adjusted total corporate operating costs* decreased by $0.1 billion primarily driven by favorability from higher bank interest, improved performance in our digital business and efs, and a reduction in our core functional costs. these decreases were partially offset by higher ehs costs.
*non-gaap financial measure
other consolidated information restructuring and separation costs. significant, higher-cost restructuring programs are excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for internal and external purposes; those excluded amounts are reported in restructuring and other charges for corporate. in addition, we incur costs associated with separation activities, which are also excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for internal and external purposes. see note 20 for further information on restructuring and separation costs.
interest and other financial charges were $1.1 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowings balances, partially offset by a lower allocation of interest expense to discontinued operations. inclusive of interest expense in discontinued operations, total interest and other financial charges were $1.1 billion, $1.7 billion and $2.5 billion for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the primary components of interest and other financial charges are interest on short- and long-term borrowings.
debt extinguishment costs were zero, $0.5 billion and $6.5 billion for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and
postretirement benefit plans. refer to note 13 for information about our pension and retiree benefit plans.
provision (benefit) for income taxes            $1,162            $(3)          $(757)
for the year ended december 31, 2023, the income tax rate was 11.4% compared to 0.4% for the year ended december 31, 2022. the tax rate for 2023 reflects a tax provision on pre-tax income while the tax rate for 2022 reflects a tax benefit on a pre-tax loss.
the provision (benefit) for income taxes was $1.2 billion and an insignificant benefit for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the increase in tax was primarily due to the tax effect of the increase in pre-tax income ($1.1 billion) excluding gains and losses on our retained and sold ownership interests and a decrease in favorable audit resolutions ($0.1 billion). there was an insignificant tax on the net gains in ge healthcare, aercap and baker hughes equity in both periods because of tax-free disposition of ge healthcare shares and because of available capital losses.
for the year ended december 31, 2023, the adjusted income tax rate* was 24.5% compared to 25.4% for the year ended december 31, 2022. the adjusted provision (benefit) for income taxes* was $1.1 billion in 2023 and $0.4 billion in 2022. the increase in tax was primarily due to the tax effect of the increase in adjusted earnings before taxes* and a decrease in favorable audit resolutions.
the rate of tax on non-u.s. operations is increased because we have losses in foreign jurisdictions where it is not likely that such losses can be utilized and therefore no tax benefit is provided for those losses. non-u.s. losses also limit our ability to claim u.s. foreign tax credits on certain operations, further increasing the rate of tax on non-u.s. operations. in addition, as part of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (u.s. tax reform), the u.s. enacted a minimum tax on foreign earnings (global intangible low taxed income). we have tangible assets outside the u.s. and pay significant foreign taxes which substantially reduce the u.s. liability on these earnings. overall, these factors increase the rate of tax on our non-u.s. operations.
absent the effect of non-u.s. losses without a tax benefit and additional u.s. tax on global income, non-u.s. operations generally produce a tax benefit as certain non-u.s. income is subject to local country tax rates that are below the u.s. statutory tax rate.
the rate of tax on our profitable non-u.s. earnings is below the u.s. statutory tax rate because we have significant business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the u.s. statutory rate and because ge funds certain non-u.s. operations through foreign companies that are subject to low foreign taxes. most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-u.s. business operations. given u.s. tax reform, substantially all of our net prior unrepatriated earnings were subject to u.s. tax and accordingly we generally expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-u.s. cash without additional u.s. federal tax cost and any foreign withholding taxes on a repatriation to the u.s. would potentially be partially offset by a u.s. foreign tax credit. we reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis. in 2023 and 2022, in connection with the execution of the company's plans to prepare for the spin-offs of ge vernova and ge healthcare, we incurred an insignificant amount and $0.1 billion of tax, respectively, due to repatriation of previously reinvested earnings.
a substantial portion of the benefit for lower-taxed non-u.s. earnings related to business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the u.s. statutory rate is derived from our aerospace operations located in singapore where the earnings are primarily taxed at a rate of 8.5% and 8.0% in prior periods and our power operations located in switzerland where the earnings are taxed at a rate between 16.3% and 18.6%.

for the year ended december 31, 2023, the increase in expense from global operations compared to 2022 reflects higher u.s. taxes on global activities slightly offset by higher income in lower taxed jurisdictions.
a more detailed analysis of differences between the u.s. federal statutory rate and the consolidated effective rate, as well as other information about our income tax provisions, is provided in the critical accounting estimates section and note 15.
research and development. we conduct research and development (r&d) activities to continually enhance our existing products and services, develop new products and services to meet our customers' changing needs and requirements, and address new market opportunities. in addition to funding r&d internally, we also receive funding externally from our customers and partners, which contributes to the overall r&d for the company.

discontinued operations primarily comprise our former ge healthcare business, our mortgage portfolio in poland (bank bph), our ge capital aviation services (gecas) business, and other trailing assets and liabilities associated with prior dispositions. results of operations, financial position and cash flows for these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented and the notes to the financial statements have been adjusted on a retrospective basis. see note 2 for further information regarding our businesses in discontinued operations.
capital resources and liquidity financial policy. we intend to maintain a disciplined financial policy with a sustainable investment-grade long-term credit rating. in the fourth quarter of 2021, the company announced plans to form three industry-leading, global, investment-grade companies, each of which will determine their own financial policies, including capital allocation, dividend, mergers and acquisitions and share buyback decisions.
liquidity policy. we maintain a strong focus on liquidity and define our liquidity risk tolerance based on sources and uses to maintain a sufficient liquidity position to meet our business needs and financial obligations under both normal and stressed conditions. we believe that our consolidated liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs.
consolidated liquidity. our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash and cash equivalents, free cash flows* from our operating businesses, cash generated from asset sales and dispositions, and short-term borrowing facilities, including revolving credit facilities. cash generation can be subject to variability based on many factors, including seasonality, receipt of down payments on large equipment orders, timing of billings on long-term contracts, timing of aerospace-related customer allowances, market conditions and our ability to execute dispositions. total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $17.0 billion at december 31, 2023, of which $2.8 billion was held in the u.s. and $14.2 billion was held outside the u.s.
cash held in non-u.s. entities has generally been reinvested in active foreign business operations; however, substantially all of our unrepatriated earnings were subject to u.s. federal tax and, if there is a change in reinvestment, we would expect to be able to repatriate available cash (excluding amounts held in countries with currency controls) without additional federal tax cost. any foreign withholding tax on a repatriation to the u.s. may be at least partially offset by a u.s. foreign tax credit. with regards to the separation of ge healthcare in january 2023 and the planned separation of ge aerospace and ge vernova into independent companies, the planning for and execution of the separations has impacted and is expected to continue to impact indefinite reinvestment. the impact of such changes will be recorded when there is a specific change in ability and intent to reinvest earnings.
cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at december 31, 2023 included $1.7 billion of cash held in countries with currency control restrictions (including a total of $0.1 billion in russia and ukraine) and $0.4 billion of restricted use cash. cash held in countries with currency controls represents amounts held in countries that may restrict the transfer of funds to the u.s. or limit our ability to transfer funds to the u.s. without incurring substantial costs. restricted use cash represents amounts that are not available to fund operations, and primarily comprised funds restricted in connection with certain ongoing litigation matters. excluded from cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $0.8 billion of cash in our run-off insurance operations, which was classified as all other assets in the statement of financial position.
*non-gaap financial measure
in 2023, we received proceeds of $6.6 billion and completed monetization of our aercap shares. during the first quarter of 2023, we received proceeds of $0.2 billion and completed monetization of our baker hughes position. as part of the spin-off of ge healthcare completed in the first quarter of 2023, we retained an approximately 19.9% stake of ge healthcare common stock. during the second quarter of 2023, we received total proceeds of $2.2 billion from the disposition of 28.8 million shares of ge healthcare. we intend to exit our remaining stake in ge healthcare over time, in an orderly manner. see notes 3 and 19 for further information.
following approval of a statutory permitted accounting practice in 2018 by our primary insurance regulator, the kansas insurance department (kid), we provided a total of $13.2 billion of capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries, including $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2023. we expect to provide the final capital contribution of up to $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2024, pending completion of our december 31, 2023 statutory reporting process. see note 12 for further information.
on march 6, 2022, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3 billion of our common stock. in connection with this authorization, we repurchased 10.6 million shares for $1.1 billion during 2023. additionally, during 2023, we redeemed our outstanding shares of ge preferred stock for $5.8 billion.
borrowings. consolidated total borrowings were $21.0 billion and $24.1 billion at december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively, a decrease of $3.1 billion. the reduction in borrowings was driven by $3.4 billion of net maturities and repayments of debt.
we have in place committed revolving credit facilities totaling $13.5 billion at december 31, 2023, comprising a $10.0 billion unused back-up revolving syndicated credit facility and a total of $3.5 billion of bilateral revolving credit facilities.
credit ratings and conditions. we have relied, and may continue to rely, on the short- and long-term debt capital markets to fund, among other things, a significant portion of our operations. the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. moody's investors service (moody's), standard and poor's global ratings (s&p), and fitch ratings (fitch) currently issue ratings on our short- and long-term debt. our credit ratings as of the date of this filing are set forth in the following table.
moody's        s&amp;p        fitch outlook           stable         stable         stable short term        p-2            a-2            f2
long term         baa1           bbb+           bbb we are disclosing our credit ratings and any current quarter updates to these ratings to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds and access to liquidity. our ratings may be subject to a revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. in connection with the planned spin-off of ge vernova, rating agencies are reviewing ratings for both ge vernova and ge aerospace. for a description of some of the potential consequences of a reduction in our credit ratings, see the financial risks section of risk factors.
substantially all of the company's debt agreements in place at december 31, 2023 do not contain material credit rating covenants. our unused back-up revolving syndicated credit facility and certain of our bilateral revolving credit facilities contain a customary net debt-to-ebitda financial covenant, which we satisfied at december 31, 2023.
the company may from time to time enter into agreements that contain minimum ratings requirements. the following table provides a summary of the maximum estimated liquidity impact in the event of further downgrades below each stated ratings level.
our most significant contractual ratings requirements are related to ordinary course commercial activities. the timing within the quarter of the potential liquidity impact of these areas may differ, as can the remedies to resolving any potential breaches of required ratings levels.
foreign exchange and interest rate risk. as a result of our global operations, we generate and incur a significant portion of our revenues and expenses in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. such principal currencies include the euro, the chinese renminbi, the british pound sterling and the indian rupee, among others. the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on earnings were $0.2 billion, $0.1 billion and 0.1 billion for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 and 2021, respectively. see note 22 for further information about our risk exposures, our use of derivatives, and the effects of this activity on our financial statements.
exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques, including selective use of derivatives. we apply policies to manage each of these risks, including prohibitions on speculative activities. it is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies. to assess exposure to interest rate risk, we apply a +/- 100 basis points change in interest rates and keep that in place for the next 12 months. to assess exposure to currency risk of assets and liabilities denominated in other than their functional currencies, we evaluated the effect of a 10% shift in exchange rates against the u.s. dollar (usd). the analyses indicated that our 2023 consolidated net earnings would decline by $0.1 and $0.2 billion for interest rate risk and for foreign exchange risk, respectively.
libor reform. the publication of the most commonly used usd libor representative rates ceased on june 30, 2023. we evaluated the financial impact in accordance with accounting standards update (asu) 2020-04, reference rate reform (topic 848): facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting and the overall impact to our financial statements is immaterial.
statement of cash flows cash flows from continuing operations. the most significant source of cash in cfoa is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from equipment or services sales. the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities, and postretirement plans. ge measures itself on a free cash flows* basis. this metric includes cfoa plus investments in property, plant and equipment and additions to internal-use software; this metric excludes any cash received from dispositions of property, plant and equipment. we believe that investors may also find it useful to compare free cash flows* performance without the effects of cash flows for taxes related to business sales, operating activities related to our run-off insurance operations, separation cash expenditures and corporate restructuring cash expenditures (associated with the separation-related program announced in october 2022). we believe this measure will better allow management and investors to evaluate the capacity of our operations to generate free cash flows*.

cash from operating activities was $5.6 billion in 2023, an increase of $1.5 billion compared to 2022, primarily due to: an increase in net income (after adjusting for depreciation of property plant and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, non-cash (gains) losses related to our retained and sold ownership interests in ge healthcare, aercap and baker hughes and the nonrecurrence of non-operating debt extinguishment costs) primarily in our aerospace business. the components of all other operating activities were as follows:
increase (decrease) in employee benefit liabilities                           $823          $424
increase (decrease) in aerospace-related customer allowance accruals         (203)            47

*non-gaap financial measure
the cash impacts from changes in working capital compared to prior year were as follows: current receivables of $1.9 billion, driven by higher collections partially offset by higher volume; inventories, including deferred inventory, of $0.4 billion, driven by higher liquidations partially offset by higher material purchases; current contract assets of $(0.4) billion, driven by higher revenue recognition on our long-term equipment contracts and other service agreements, partially offset by higher billings on our long-term service agreements and lower net favorable changes in estimated profitability; accounts payable and equipment project payables of $(2.5) billion, driven by higher disbursements, including prepayments of supply chain finance programs at renewable energy, power and corporate, partially offset by higher volume; and progress collections and current deferred income of $0.6 billion, driven by higher collections, including down payments on equipment orders at renewable energy in the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by higher liquidations.
cash from investing activities was $6.9 billion in 2023, a decrease of $4.0 billion compared to 2022, primarily due to: lower cash received related to net settlements between our continuing operations and businesses in discontinued operations of $7.1 billion, which primarily related to ge healthcare in connection with the spin-off in 2023 partially offset by the nonrecurrence of a capital contribution to bank bph in 2022 (both components of all other investing activities); the acquisition of nexus controls in our power business of $0.3 billion in 2023; partially offset by an increase in proceeds of $4.3 billion from the disposition of our retained ownership interests in ge healthcare, aercap and baker hughes. cash used for additions to property, plant and equipment and internal-use software, which are components of free cash flows*, was $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
cash used for financing activities was $10.6 billion in 2023, a decrease of $3.1 billion compared to 2022, primarily due to: the nonrecurrence of cash paid to repurchase long-term debt of $6.9 billion including cash received of $0.3 billion related to debt extinguishment costs, excluding a non-cash debt basis adjustment of $(0.8) billion; net cash received on derivatives hedging foreign currency debt of $0.1 billion in 2023 compared to net cash paid of $0.6 billion in 2022 (a component of all other financing activities); lower net debt maturities of $0.5 billion; nonrecurrence of the settlement of concept laser gmbh's interest in an aerospace technology joint venture of $0.2 billion (a component of all other financing activities); partially offset by higher cash paid for redemption of ge preferred stock of $5.7 billion.
cash flows from discontinued operations cash used for operating activities of discontinued operations was $(0.4) billion in 2023, a decrease of $2.3 billion compared with 2022, primarily driven by decrease in net income, higher disbursements related to purchases of materials in prior periods and higher separation costs related to our former ge healthcare business partially offset by tax receipts from our trailing operations.
cash used for investing activities of discontinued operations was $3.0 billion in 2023, a decrease of $5.7 billion compared with 2022, primarily driven by lower net settlements between our discontinued operations and businesses in continuing operations of $7.1 billion partially offset by the deconsolidation of ge healthcare cash and equivalents of $1.8 billion.
cash from financing activities of discontinued operations was $2.0 billion in 2023, a decrease of $6.1 billion compared with 2022, primarily driven by lower long-term debt issuances at ge healthcare in connection with the spin-off of $6.3 billion.
critical accounting estimates. accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. actual results in these areas could differ from management's estimates. see note 1 for further information on our most significant accounting policies.
revenue recognition on long-term services agreements. we have long-term service agreements with our customers predominately within our power and aerospace segments that require us to maintain the customers' assets over the contract terms, which generally range from 5 to 25 years. however, contract modifications that extend or revise contracts are not uncommon. we recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. this requires us to make estimates of customer payments expected to be received over the contract term as well as the costs to perform required maintenance services.
customers generally pay us based on the utilization of the asset (per hour of usage for example) or upon the occurrence of a major event within the contract such as an overhaul or major outage. as a result, a significant estimate in determining expected revenues of a contract is estimating how customers will utilize their assets over the term of the agreement. the estimate of utilization, which can change over the contract life, impacts both the amount of customer payments we expect to receive and our estimate of future contract costs. customers' asset utilization will influence the timing and extent of overhauls and other service events over the life of the contract. we generally use a combination of both historical utilization trends as well as forward-looking information such as market conditions and potential asset retirements in developing our revenue estimates.
to develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. in developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.
*non-gaap financial measure
we routinely review estimates under long-term service agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook. these revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. contract modifications that change the rights and obligations, as well as the nature, timing and extent of future cash flows, are evaluated for potential price concessions, contract asset impairments and significant financing to determine if adjustments of earnings are required before effectively accounting for a modified contract as a new contract.
we regularly assess expected billings adjustments and customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. we gain insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and fleet management strategies through close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. revisions may affect a long-term services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings.
on december 31, 2023, our net long-term service agreements balance of $(2.1) billion represents approximately (1.0)% of our total estimated life of contract billings of $215.3 billion. our contracts (on average) are approximately 19.5% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. revisions to our estimates of future billings or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by one percentage point would increase or decrease the long-term service agreements balance by $0.4 billion. billings collected on these contracts were $13.2 billion and $11.7 billion during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. see notes 1 and 8 for further information.
impairment of goodwill and other identified intangible assets. goodwill is subject to annual, or more frequent, if necessary, impairment testing. in the impairment test, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts, including strategic and annual operating plans, adjusted for terminal value assumptions, or a market approach, when available and appropriate, utilizing market observable pricing multiples of similar businesses and comparable transactions, or both. these impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, and changes to those assumptions could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. to address this uncertainty, we perform sensitivity analyses on key estimates and assumptions. once the fair value is determined, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, it is impaired.
we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. determining whether an impairment loss has occurred requires the use of our internal forecast to estimate future cash flows and the useful life over which these cash flows will occur. to determine fair value, we use our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate. see notes 1 and 7 for further information.
insurance and investment contracts. refer to the other items - insurance section for further discussion of the accounting estimates and assumptions in our insurance reserves and their sensitivity to change. see notes 1 and 12 for further information.
pension assumptions. refer to note 13 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.
income taxes. our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. in addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. historically u.s. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. due to the enactment of u.s. tax reform in 2017, repatriations of available cash from foreign earnings are expected to be free of u.s. federal income tax but may incur withholding, with a potential u.s. tax credit offset, or state taxes. indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the company. most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-u.s. business operations. we reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis. in 2023 and 2022, in connection with the execution of the company's plans to prepare for the spin-off of ge vernova and ge healthcare, we incurred an insignificant amount and $0.1 billion of tax, respectively, due to repatriation of previously reinvested earnings.
we evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which heavily rely on estimates. we use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. amounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-u.s. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. of this, an insignificant amount at december 31, 2023 and $0.4 billion at december 31, 2022, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our ge healthcare and legacy financial services businesses. see other consolidated information - income taxes section and notes 1 and 15 for further information.
loss contingencies. loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments. when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. when there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. however, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. we regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. see note 24 for further information.
other items insurance. the run-off insurance operations of north american life and health (nalh) include employers reassurance corporation (erac) and union fidelity life insurance company (uflic). erac primarily assumed long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. uflic primarily assumed long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from genworth financial inc. (genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004.
on january 1, 2023, we adopted asu no. 2018-12, financial services - insurance (topic 944): targeted improvements to the accounting for long-duration contracts (asu 2018-12). see capital resources and liquidity and notes 1, 3 and 12 for further information related to our run-off insurance operations.
key portfolio characteristics long-term care insurance contracts. the long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes (e.g., lifetime benefit periods, inflation protection options, and joint life policies) that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. presented in the table below are reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.

(a) pending completion of our december 31, 2023 statutory reporting process.
structured settlement annuities. we reinsure approximately 24,600 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 56. these structured settlement annuities were primarily underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-than-average life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment). unlike long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.
life insurance contracts. our life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. at december 31, 2023, across our u.s. and canadian life insurance portfolio, we reinsure approximately $50 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.2 million policies with an average attained age of 62. in 2023, our incurred claims were approximately $0.5 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $51,000. the covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20- and 30-year level term insurance. we anticipate a significant portion of the 20- and 30-year level term policies, which represent approximately 9% and 40% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2024 and 2034 as the policies reach the end of their 20- and 30-year level premium period, respectively.
critical accounting estimates. our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.
future policy benefit reserves. future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums and are estimated based on actuarial assumptions such as mortality, morbidity, terminations, and expenses. the liability is measured for each group of contracts (i.e., cohorts) using current cash flow assumptions.
we regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. we review at least annually in the third quarter, future policy benefit reserves cash flow assumptions, except related claim expenses which remain locked-in, and if the review concludes that the assumptions need to be updated, future policy benefit reserves are adjusted retroactively based on the revised net premium ratio using actual historical experience, updated cash flow assumptions, and the locked-in discount rate with the effect of those changes recognized in current period earnings. our annual review procedures include updating certain experience studies since our last completed review, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. the review of experience and assumptions is a comprehensive and complex process that depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. the vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. the review relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. in order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. our long-term care insurance portfolio includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.
the primary cash flow assumptions used in the annual review include:
morbidity. morbidity assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. for long-term care insurance exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utilization (amount of available benefits expected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last, including claim terminations due to death or recovery).
rate of change in morbidity. our review incorporates our best estimates of projected future changes in the morbidity rates reflected in our base claim incidence rates. these estimates draw upon a number of inputs, some of which are subjective, and all of which are interpreted and applied in the exercise of professional actuarial judgment in the context of the characteristics specific to our portfolios. this exercise of actuarial judgment considers factors such as the work performed by internal and external independent actuarial experts engaged to advise us in our annual review, the observed actual experience in our portfolios measured against our base assumptions, industry developments, and other trends, including advances in the state of medical care and healthcare technology development.
terminations. terminations include active life mortality and lapse. mortality assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on published mortality tables as adjusted for the results of our experience studies and estimates of expected future mortality improvement. lapse refers to the rate at which the underlying policies are cancelled due to non-payment of premiums by a policyholder. lapse rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on the results of our experience studies and reflect actuarial judgment.
future long-term care premium rate increases. substantially all long-term care insurance policies that are currently premium paying allow the issuing insurance entity to increase premiums, or alternatively allow the policyholder the option to decrease benefits, with approval by state regulators, should actual experience emerge worse than what was projected when such policies were initially underwritten. as a reinsurer, we rely upon the primary insurers that issued the underlying policies to file proposed premium rate increases on those policies with the relevant state insurance regulators. while we have no direct ability to seek or to institute such premium rate increases, we often collaborate with the primary insurers in accordance with reinsurance contractual terms to file proposed premium rate increases. the amount of times that rate increases have occurred varies by ceding company. we consider recent experience of rate increase filings made by our ceding companies along with state insurance regulatory processes and precedents in establishing our current expectations.
included in insurance losses, annuity benefits and other costs in our statement of earnings (loss) for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, are unfavorable and favorable pre-tax adjustments of $(155) million and $404 million, respectively, from updating the net premium ratio (i.e., the percentage of projected gross premiums required to cover expected policy benefits and related expenses) after updating for actual historical experience each quarter and updating of future cash flow assumptions.
sensitivities. the following table provides sensitivities with respect to the impact of changes of key cash flow assumptions underlying our future policy benefit reserves using the locked-in discount rate assumption and have been estimated across the entire product line rather than at an individual cohort level. as our insurance operations are in run-off, the locked-in discount rate is used for the computation of interest accretion on future policy benefit reserves. many of our assumptions, which are based on our credible experience, are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. small changes in the amounts used in the sensitivities could result in materially different outcomes from those reflected below. in addition, the effects of changes to cash flow assumptions underlying our future policy benefit reserves may be partially or wholly reflected in the period in which the assumptions are changed and/or over future periods and may vary across cohorts.

while higher assumed inflation, holding all other assumptions constant, would result in unfavorable impacts to the projected present value of future cash flows in the table above, it would be expected to be mitigated by more long-term care insurance policies reaching contractual daily or monthly benefit caps and by increased investment income from higher portfolio yields.
our run-off insurance subsidiaries are required to prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting practices. statutory accounting practices are set forth by the national association of insurance commissioners as well as state laws, regulation and general administrative rules and can differ in certain respects from gaap and would result in several of the sensitivities described in the table above being less impactful on our statutory reserves.

parent company credit support. to support ge vernova in selling products and services globally, ge often enters into contracts on behalf of ge vernova or issues parent company guarantees or trade finance instruments supporting the performance of what currently are subsidiary legal entities transacting directly with customers, in addition to providing similar credit support for non-customer related activities of ge vernova (collectively, "ge credit support"). in preparation for the spin-off, we are working to seek novation or assignment of ge credit support, the majority of which relates to parent company guarantees, associated with ge vernova legal entities from ge to ge vernova. for ge credit support that remains outstanding at the spin-off, ge vernova will be obligated to use reasonable best efforts to terminate or replace, and obtain a full release of ge's obligations and liabilities under, all such credit support. beginning in 2025, ge vernova will pay a quarterly fee to ge based on amounts related to the ge credit support. ge vernova will face other contractual restrictions and requirements while ge continues to be obligated under such credit support on behalf of ge vernova. while ge will remain obligated under the contract or instrument, ge vernova will be obligated to indemnify ge for credit support related payments that ge is required to make.
upon separation, we expect ge vernova rpo and other obligations that relate to ge credit support to be approximately $65 billion, of which approximately $33 billion and $32 billion relate to our power and renewable energy segments, respectively, and approximately $20 billion of the total relates to long-term and other service agreements. of the power and renewable energy amounts, $15 billion for both segments, respectively, are expected to contractually mature within five years. ge's maximum aggregate exposure under the ge credit support cannot be reasonably estimated given the breadth of the portfolio across each of the ge vernova businesses. the underlying obligations are predominantly customer contracts that ge vernova performs in the course of its business. we have no known instances historically where payments or performance from ge were required under parent company guarantees relating to ge vernova customer contracts. the fair value of ge vernova's obligation to indemnify ge post spin-off is not expected to be significant primarily due to the low probability of loss.
new accounting standards. in november of 2023, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued asu no. 2023-07, segment reporting (topic 280): improvements to reportable segment disclosures. the amendments are intended to increase reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. the asu is effective on a retrospective basis for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2024. we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the disclosures within our consolidated financial statements.
in december 2023, the fasb issued asu no. 2023-09, income taxes (topic 740): improvements to income tax disclosures. the amendments require disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold and further disaggregation of income taxes paid for individually significant jurisdictions. the asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the disclosures within our consolidated financial statements.
non-gaap financial measures. we believe that presenting non-gaap financial measures provides management and investors useful measures to evaluate performance and trends of the total company and its businesses. this includes adjustments in recent periods to gaap financial measures to increase period-to-period comparability following actions to strengthen our overall financial position and how we manage our business. in addition, management recognizes that certain non-gaap terms may be interpreted differently by other companies under different circumstances. in various sections of this report we have made reference to the following non-gaap financial measures in describing our (1) revenues, specifically organic revenues by segment; organic revenues; and equipment and services organic revenues and (2) profit, specifically organic profit and profit margin by segment; adjusted profit and profit margin; adjusted organic profit and profit margin; adjusted earnings (loss); adjusted income tax rate; and adjusted earnings (loss) per share (eps). the reasons we use these non-gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures follow.

we believe that adjusting profit to exclude the effects of items that are not closely associated with ongoing operations provides management and investors with a meaningful measure that increases the period-to-period comparability. gains (losses) and restructuring and other items are impacted by the timing and magnitude of gains associated with dispositions, and the timing and magnitude of costs associated with restructuring and other activities.

the service cost for our pension and other benefit plans are included in adjusted earnings*, which represents the ongoing cost of providing pension benefits to our employees. the components of non-operating benefit costs are mainly driven by capital allocation decisions and market performance. we believe the retained cost in adjusted earnings* and the adjusted tax rate* provides management and investors a useful measure to evaluate the performance of the total company and increases period-to-period comparability. we also use adjusted eps* as a performance metric at the company level for our annual executive incentive plan for 2023.

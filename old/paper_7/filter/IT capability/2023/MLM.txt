item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introductory overview martin marietta materials, inc. (the company or martin marietta) is a natural resource-based building materials company, with 2023 total revenues of $6.78 billion and 2023 net earnings from continuing operations attributable to martin marietta of $1.20 billion. these results were achieved in part by supplying aggregates (crushed stone, sand and gravel) through its network of approximately 360 quarries, mines and distribution yards in 28 states, canada and the bahamas. martin marietta also provides cement and downstream products, namely ready mixed concrete, asphalt and paving services, in certain markets where the company has a leading aggregates position. specifically, the company has two cement plants in texas, ready mixed concrete operations in arizona and texas, and asphalt operations in arizona, california, colorado and minnesota. paving services are offered in california and colorado. as of december 31, 2023, the company's south texas cement business and 20 ready mixed concrete operations that serve the austin and san antonio region are classified as assets held for sale. the company divested these operations on february 9, 2024.
on february 11, 2024, the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 20 active aggregates operations in alabama, south carolina, south florida, tennessee, and virginia from affiliates of blue water industries llc (bwi southeast) for $2.05 billion in cash. the bwi southeast acquisition complements martin marietta's existing geographic footprint in the dynamic southeast region by allowing the company to expand into new growth platforms in target markets including nashville and miami. the transaction is expected to close during 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
the company's heavy-side building materials are used in infrastructure, nonresidential and residential construction projects. aggregates are also used in agricultural, utility and environmental applications and as railroad ballast. the aggregates, cement, ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines are reported collectively as the "building materials" business.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as more fully discussed in the consolidated strategic objectives section, geography is critically important for the building materials business. the company conducts its building materials business through two reportable segments, organized by geography: east group and west group. the east group, consisting of the east and central divisions, provides aggregates and asphalt products. the west group is comprised of the southwest and west divisions and provides aggregates, cement, ready mixed concrete, asphalt and paving services.
the following ten states accounted for 82% of the building materials business 2023 total revenues: texas, north carolina, colorado, california, georgia, minnesota, arizona, iowa, florida and indiana.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations magnesia specialties the company operates a magnesia specialties business with production facilities in michigan and ohio. the magnesia specialties business produces magnesia-based chemicals products used in industrial, agricultural and environmental applications. it also produces dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers for steel production and soil stabilization. magnesia specialties' products are shipped to customers domestically and worldwide.
strategic objectives the company's strategic planning process, or strategic operating analysis and review (soar), provides the framework for execution of martin marietta's long-term strategic plan. guided by this framework and considering the cyclicality of the building materials business, the company determines capital allocation priorities to maximize long-term shareholder value creation. the company's strategy includes ongoing evaluation of aggregates-led opportunities of scale in new domestic markets (i.e., platform acquisitions) and expansion through acquisitions that complement existing operations (i.e., bolt-on acquisitions). to that effect, the company has invested nearly $8.0 billion in acquisitions since the launch of soar in 2010. the company finances such opportunities with the goal of preserving its financial flexibility by having a leverage ratio (consolidated net debt-to-consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, earnings/loss from nonconsolidated equity affiliates and certain other adjustments as specified below, or adjusted ebitda) within a range of 2.0 times to 2.5 times within a reasonable period of time, typically within 18 months, following the completion of a debt-financed transaction. soar also includes the identification and potential disposition of assets that are not consistent with stated strategic goals. notably, since 2022, the company divested its colorado and central texas ready mixed concrete businesses and certain west coast cement and ready mixed concrete operations and, as of february 9, 2024, completed the divestiture of its south texas cement and related ready mixed concrete operations, refining its product mix and improving its margin profile, while providing balance sheet flexibility. in total, these divestitures provided pretax cash proceeds of $3.1 billion.
the company, by purposeful design, will continue to be an aggregates-led business that focuses on markets with strong, underlying growth fundamentals where it can sustain or achieve a leading market position. aggregates gross profit represented 68% of 2023 total consolidated gross profit. for martin marietta, strategic cement and targeted downstream operations are located where the company has, or envisions, among other things, a clear path toward a leading aggregates position. additionally, strategic cement operations are geared toward markets in which supply cannot be meaningfully interdicted by water.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations generally, the company's building materials are both sourced and sold locally. as a result, geography is critically important when assessing market attractiveness and growth opportunities. attractive geographies generally exhibit (a) population growth and/or high population density, both of which are drivers of heavy-side building materials consumption; (b) business and employment diversity, drivers of greater economic stability; and (c) a superior state financial position, a driver of public infrastructure investment.
population growth and density are assessed based on a site's proximity to one of the megaregions in the united states. megaregions are large networks of metropolitan population centers covering thousands of square miles. according to america 2050, a planning and policy program of the regional plan association, a majority of the nation's population and economic growth through 2050 will occur in 11 megaregions. the company has a meaningful presence in ten megaregions. as evidence of the successful execution of soar, the company's leading positions in the texas triangle, colorado's front range, northern and southern california and arizona's sun corridor megaregions, its growth platform in the southern portion of the northeast megaregion and its enhanced position in the piedmont atlantic megaregion, primarily in the atlanta area, are the results of acquisitions since 2011. the company has a legacy presence in the southeastern portion of the great lakes megaregion, encompassing operations in indiana and ohio, as well as the florida megaregion and the gulf coast megaregion in texas.
the company focuses its geographic footprint along significant transportation and commerce corridors, particularly where both land is readily available and land use entitlement is likely achievable for the development of fulfillment and/or data centers. the retail sector (both e-commerce and brick and mortar) values transportation corridors, as logistics and distribution are critical considerations for construction supporting that industry. in addition, technology companies view these areas as attractive locations for data centers.
the company considers a state's financial health rating, as issued by s&p global ratings, in determining the opportunities and attractiveness of areas for expansion or development. the company's top ten revenue-generating states have been evaluated and scored a financial health rating of aa- or higher, where aaa is the highest score. the company also reviews the state's ability to secure additional infrastructure funding and financing.

2023 performance highlights achieved industry-leading safety performance:
•company-wide total injury incident rate (tiir) of 0.78, the third consecutive year of world-class or better tiir thresholds achieved record financial performance:
the company achieved record revenues, gross profit, diluted earnings per share and adjusted ebitda (defined in the results of operations section), reflecting the efficacy of its value-over-volume commercial strategy and continued focus on operational excellence and despite lower shipments due to the effects of restrictive monetary policies and a housing slowdown. further, 2023 marked the twelfth consecutive year of growth for adjusted ebitda. the company's commitment to safety and operational and commercial excellence resulted in the following financial performance from continuing operations (comparisons with 2022):
•record consolidated total revenues of $6.78 billion compared with $6.16 billion, an increase of 10.0%
•record consolidated gross profit of $2.02 billion compared with $1.42 billion, an increase of 42.1%

•optimized portfolio with divestitures of the company's california cement operations
•capital investments into operations of $650.3 million
•repurchase of 0.4 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $150.0 million form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business environment building materials business the building materials business serves customers in the construction marketplace. the business' profitability is sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and cyclical swings in construction spending, which are affected by fluctuations in levels of public-sector infrastructure funding; interest rates; access to capital markets; and demographic, geographic, employment and population dynamics.
the heavy-side construction business, inclusive of much of the company's operations, is conducted outdoors. therefore, erratic weather patterns, precipitation and other weather-related conditions, including flooding, hurricanes, extreme hot and cold temperatures, earthquakes, droughts and wildfires, can significantly affect production schedules, shipments, costs, efficiencies and profitability. generally, the financial results for the first and fourth quarters are most subject to the impacts of winter weather, while the second and third quarters can be subject to the impacts of heavy precipitation and excessive heat. the impacts of erratic weather patterns are more fully discussed in the building materials business' key considerations section.
product lines aggregates are an engineered, granular material consisting of crushed stone, sand and gravel, manufactured to specific sizes, grades and chemistry for use primarily in construction applications. the company's operations consist mostly of open pit quarries; however, the company is also the largest operator of underground aggregates mines in the united states, with 14 active underground mines located in the east group. the company's aggregates reserves average approximately 75 years at the 2023 annual production level.
cement is the basic agent used to bind coarse aggregates, sand and water in the production of ready mixed concrete. as of december 31, 2023, the company had production facilities in midlothian, texas, south of dallas/fort worth, and new braunfels, texas, centrally located along i-35 between san antonio and austin. the company also operated several cement distribution terminals. the two production facilities produce portland limestone and specialty cements, with an annual capacity at december 31, 2023 of approximately 4.5 million tons and collectively operated at approximately 71% utilization for clinker production in 2023; clinker is the initial product of cement production. the midlothian plant has a permit that allows for capacity expansion of 0.8 million tons. the company is currently undertaking a finishing capacity expansion project at the midlothian plant, which is expected to be completed in mid-2024 and will provide 0.5 million tons of incremental annual capacity. further, the company has converted its midlothian and hunter plants to manufacture a less carbon-intensive portland limestone cement, known as type 1l, which has been approved by the texas department of transportation. on february 9, 2024, the company closed the sale of the hunter cement business in south texas, related distribution terminals and the austin and san antonio ready mix concrete business to crh americas materials. this divestiture optimizes the company's portfolio and product mix and provides additional balance sheet flexibility to redeploy net proceeds into pure-play aggregates acquisitions.
calcium carbonate in the form of limestone is the principal raw material used in the production of cement. as of december 31, 2023, the company owned more than 600 million tons of limestone reserves adjacent to its cement production plants in texas. the cement grade limestone reserves used for cement production at the south texas production facility were included with the divestiture to crh americas materials, inc. during 2021, the company purchased two cement plants in redding and tehachapi, california, and related distribution facilities as part of the acquisition of lehigh hanson, inc.'s west region business (lehigh west region). the redding plant and related distribution terminals were sold on june 30, 2022. the tehachapi plant was sold on october 31, 2023.
ready mixed concrete is measured in cubic yards and specifically batched or produced for customers' construction projects and then typically transported by mixer trucks and poured at the project site. the coarse aggregates used for ready mixed concrete are a washed material with limited amounts of fines (i.e., dirt and clay). the company operates ready mixed concrete plants in arizona and texas.
asphalt is most commonly used in surfacing roads and parking lots and consists of liquid asphalt, or bitumen, the binding medium, and aggregates. similar to ready mixed concrete, each asphalt batch is produced to customer specifications. the company's asphalt operations are located in arizona, california, colorado and minnesota and paving services are offered in california and colorado.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market dynamics for the downstream ready mixed concrete and asphalt product lines include a highly competitive environment and lower barriers to entry compared with the company's upstream product lines of aggregates and cement.
•according to the latest available data published by the u.s. geological survey, for the nine months ended september 30, 2023, estimated construction aggregates consumption decreased slightly compared with the nine months ended september 30, 2022, and for the eleven months ended november 30, 2023, cement consumption decreased slightly versus the comparable prior-year period.
•national not-seasonally-adjusted construction spending statistics for the twelve months ended december 31, 2023 versus the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, according to u.s. census bureau, reveal:
- total value of construction put in place increased 7%
- private nonresidential construction market spending increased 22%
-  private residential construction market spending decreased 6%
the principal end-use markets of the building materials business are public infrastructure (i.e., highways; streets; roads; bridges; and schools); nonresidential construction (i.e., manufacturing and distribution facilities; industrial complexes; office buildings; large retailers and wholesalers; healthcare; hospitality; and energy-related activity); and residential construction (i.e., subdivision development; and single- and multi-family housing). aggregates are also used in agricultural, utility and environmental applications and as railroad ballast, collectively comprising the chemrock/rail market.
public infrastructure projects can require several years to complete, while residential and nonresidential construction projects are usually completed within one year. generally, customer purchase orders do not contain firm quantity commitments, regardless of end-use market. therefore, management does not utilize a company backlog in managing its business.
infrastructure the public infrastructure market accounted for 36% of the company's aggregates shipments in 2023. the company's shipments to this end-use market are in line with the most recent five-year average of 35% but remain slightly below the most recent ten-year average of 38%.
public construction projects, once awarded, are typically seen through to completion. thus, delays from weather or other factors can serve to extend the duration of the construction cycle. while construction spending in the public and private market sectors is affected by economic cycles, public infrastructure spending has been comparatively more stable due to the predictability of funding from federal, state and local governments. the infrastructure investments and jobs act (iij act) was signed into law on november 15, 2021 and contains a five-year surface transportation reauthorization plus $110 billion in new funding for roads, bridges and other hard infrastructure projects.
state and local initiatives that support infrastructure funding, including gas tax increases, new funding mechanisms and other ballot initiatives, are increasing in size and number as these governments recognize the need for their expanded role in public infrastructure funding. in november 2023, 248 state and local ballot initiatives, or 88% of all infrastructure funding measures up for vote, were approved. these approved infrastructure initiatives are estimated to generate $7.0 billion in one-time and recurring revenues, with initiatives in texas, the company's largest revenue-generating state, accounting for $4.2 billion of this total.
nonresidential the nonresidential construction market accounted for 35% of the company's aggregates shipments in 2023. large industrial projects of scale led by energy and domestic manufacturing continue to lead the segment, accounting for the majority of total nonresidential shipments. the company continues to expect enhanced federal investment from the inflation reduction act and the creating helpful incentives to produce semiconductors, or chips act, will further support and accelerate growth trends in this end use, including restructured manufacturing and energy supply chains and electric vehicle transition. while light nonresidential demand remained resilient through 2023 despite higher interest rates, high office vacancy rates and tighter commercial lending conditions, the company expects 2024 demand in this segment to moderate, as it generally follows single-family residential development with a lag.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations residential the residential construction market accounted for 24% of the company's aggregates shipments in 2023. this end use typically moves in direct correlation with economic cycles. the company's exposure to residential construction is split between aggregates used in the construction of subdivisions (including streets, sidewalks, utilities and storm and sewage drainage), single-family homes and multi-family units. construction of both subdivisions and single-family homes is nearly three times more aggregates intensive than construction of multi-family units. therefore, the level of new subdivision starts, as well as new single-family housing permits, is a strong leading indicator of residential volumes. for the year ended december 31, 2023, not seasonally-adjusted national housing starts decreased 9% to 1.41 million units compared with 2022 and not-seasonally-adjusted national housing permits decreased 12% versus 2022. as interest rates stabilize and affordability headwinds recede, the company expects single-family residential construction to recover as demand still far exceeds supply, particularly in the company's key markets.
chemrock/rail the remaining 5% of the company's 2023 aggregates shipments was to the chemrock/rail market, which includes ballast and agricultural limestone. ballast is an aggregates product used to stabilize railroad track beds. agricultural lime, a high-calcium carbonate material, is used as a supplement in animal feed, a soil acidity neutralizer and agricultural growth enhancer. additionally, chemrock/rail includes rip rap (used as a stabilizing material to control erosion caused by water runoff at embankments, ocean beaches, inlets, rivers and streams), and high-calcium limestone (used as filler in glass, plastic, paint, rubber, adhesives, grease and paper). chemical-grade, high-calcium limestone is used as a desulfurization material in utility plants.
pricing trends materials pricing for construction projects is generally based on terms committing to the availability of specified products of a stated quantity at an agreed-upon price during a definitive period. since infrastructure projects span multiple years, announced price changes can have a lag time before taking effect while the company sells products under existing price agreements. pricing escalators included in multi-year infrastructure contracts serve to somewhat mitigate this effect. however, during periods of sharp or rapid increases in production costs, multi-year infrastructure contract pricing may provide only nominal pricing growth. additionally, the company may implement multiple price increases throughout the year, on a market-by-market basis, where appropriate, as was done in 2023 and 2022. pricing is determined locally and is affected by supply and demand characteristics of the local market. for further information on pricing, see the discussion in the financial overview section.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cost structure costs of revenues for the building materials business are components of costs incurred at the quarries, mines, cement plants, ready mixed concrete plants, asphalt plants, paving operations and distribution yards and facilities. cost of revenues also includes the cost of resale materials, freight expenses to transport materials from a producing quarry or cement plant to a distribution yard or facility (internal freight), third-party freight and delivery costs incurred by the company and then billed to customers (external freight) and production overhead costs.
generally, the significant components of cost of revenues for the aggregates product line are (1) labor and benefits; (2) internal freight; (3) repairs and maintenance; (4) depreciation, depletion and amortization; (5) external freight; (6) supplies; (7) energy; and (8) contract services. in 2023, these categories represented 86% of the aggregates product line's total cost of revenues, excluding inventory change.
variable costs are expenses that fluctuate with the level of production volume, while fixed costs are expenses that do not vary based on production or sales volume. production is the key driver in determining the levels of variable costs, as it affects the number of hourly employees and related labor hours. further, components of energy, supplies and repairs and maintenance costs also increase in connection with higher production volumes. accordingly, the company's operating leverage can be substantial.
generally, when the company invests capital in facilities and equipment, increased capacity and productivity reduce labor and repair costs, and can offset increased fixed depreciation costs. however, the increased productivity and related efficiencies may not be fully realized in a lower-demand environment, resulting in under-absorption of fixed costs.
wage and benefit inflation and other increases in labor costs may be somewhat mitigated by enhanced productivity in an expanding economy. during economic downturns, the company reviews its operations and, where practical, temporarily idles certain sites. the company is able to serve these markets with other open facilities that are in close proximity. in certain markets, management can create production "super crews" that work on a rotating basis at various locations. for example, within a market, a crew may work three days per week at one quarry and the other two workdays at another quarry. this has allowed the company to responsibly manage headcount in periods of lower demand.
cement production is a capital-intensive operation with high fixed costs to run plants that operate continuously with the exception of maintenance shutdowns. kiln and finishing mill maintenance typically requires a plant to be shut down for a period of time as repairs are made. in 2023 and 2022, the cement operations incurred outage costs of $38.4 million and $33.3 million, respectively. the increase in outage costs in 2023 compared with 2022 is primarily attributable to first-time work on a clinker cooler and partial shell replacements in two kilns. the company adjusts production levels in anticipation of planned maintenance shutdowns.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the production of ready mixed concrete and asphalt requires the use of cement and liquid asphalt raw materials, respectively. therefore, fluctuations in availability and prices for these raw materials directly affect the company's operating results.
typically, diesel fuel represents the single-largest component of energy costs for the building materials business. the average cost per gallon was $3.25 and $4.01 in 2023 and 2022, respectively. changes in energy costs also affect the prices that the company pays for related supplies, including explosives, conveyor belting and tires. further, the company's contracts for shipping products on its rail and waterborne distribution network typically include provisions for escalations or reductions in the amounts paid by the company if the price of fuel moves outside a stated range.
building materials business' key considerations growth markets with limited supply of indigenous stone must be served via a long-haul distribution network the u.s. department of the interior identified possible sources of indigenous rock and documented its limited supply in certain areas of the united states, including the coastal areas from virginia to texas. further, certain interior united states markets may experience limited availability of locally sourced aggregates resulting from increasingly restrictive zoning, permitting and/or environmental laws and regulations. the company's long-haul distribution network is used to supplement, or in many cases, wholly supply, the local crushed stone needs of these areas and provides the company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers primarily in the southwest and southeast coastal markets.
the long-haul distribution network can also diversify market risk for locations that engage in long-haul transportation of aggregates products. this is particularly true where a producing quarry serves a local market and transports products via rail, water and/or truck to be sold in other markets. the risk of a downturn in one market may be somewhat mitigated by other markets served by the location.
product shipments are moved by rail, water and truck through the company's long-haul distribution network. the company's rail network primarily serves its texas, florida, north carolina, colorado and gulf coast markets, while the company's bahamas and nova scotia locations transport materials via oceangoing ships. the company's strategic focus includes expanding inland and offshore capacity and acquiring distribution yards and port locations to offload transported material. as of december 31, 2023, the company's distribution network consisted of 76 aggregates yards and 5 cement terminals.
the company's rail shipments result in continued reliance on railroad operations, including track congestion, crew and locomotive availability, the effects of adverse weather conditions and the ability to negotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts. further, changes in the operating strategy of rail transportation providers can create operational inefficiencies and increased costs from the company's rail network.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations a portion of railcars and all ships in the company's long-haul distribution network are under short- and long-term leases, some with purchase options, and contracts of affreightment. the limited availability of water and rail transportation providers, coupled with limited distribution sites, can adversely affect lease rates for such services and ultimately the freight rates.
the company has long-term agreements providing dedicated shipping capacity from its bahamas and nova scotia operations to its coastal ports that expire in 2026 and 2027, respectively. these contracts of affreightment are take-or-pay contracts with minimum and maximum shipping requirements. the minimum requirements were met in 2023. there can be no assurance that such contracts will be renewed upon expiration or that terms will continue without significant increases.
public infrastructure, historically, the company's largest end-use market, is funded through a combination of federal, state and local sources transportation investments generally boost the economy by creating jobs and enhancing mobility and access, which are priorities of many of the government's economic plans. public-sector construction related to transportation infrastructure is funded through a combination of federal, state and local sources. the federal highway bill, currently the iij act, provides annual funding for public-sector highway construction projects and includes spending authorizations, which represent the maximum financial obligation that will result from the immediate or future outlays of federal funds for highway and transit programs. the federal government's surface transportation programs are funded mostly through the receipts of highway user taxes placed in the highway trust fund, which is divided into the highway account and the mass transit account. revenues credited to the highway trust fund are primarily derived from a federal gas tax, a federal tax on certain other motor fuels and interest on the accounts' accumulated balances. of the currently imposed federal gas tax of $0.184 per gallon, which has been static since 1993, $0.15 is allocated to the highway account of the highway trust fund.
since most states are required to balance their budgets, reductions in revenues generally require a reduction in states' expenditures. however, the impact of state revenue reductions on highway investment will vary depending on whether the monies come from dedicated revenue sources, such as highway user fees, or whether portions are paid for with general funds.
in addition to federal appropriations, each state typically funds its infrastructure investment from specifically allocated amounts collected from various user fees, typically gasoline taxes and vehicle fees. states have assumed a significantly larger role in funding infrastructure investment, including initiating special-purpose taxes and raising state gas taxes. management believes that financing at the state and local levels, such as bond issuances, toll roads, vehicle miles traveled fees and tax initiatives, will continue to grow and have a fundamental role in advancing infrastructure projects. state infrastructure investment generally leads to increased growth opportunities for the company. the level of state public-works spending is varied across the nation and dependent upon individual state economies, and the degree to which the company could be affected by a reduction or slowdown in infrastructure spending varies by state. the state economies of the building materials business' ten largest revenue-generating states may disproportionately affect the company's financial performance.
governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest rate-sensitive than private-sector spending. obligations of federal funds are a leading indicator of highway construction activity in the united states. before a state or local department of transportation can solicit bids on an eligible construction project, it enters into an agreement with the federal highway administration to obligate the federal government to pay its portion of the project cost. federal obligations are subject to annual funding appropriations by congress.
the need for surface transportation improvements continues to significantly outpace the amount of available funding. a large number of roads, highways and bridges built following the establishment of the interstate highway system in 1956 now require major repair or reconstruction. according to the latest information available from the road information program (trip), a national transportation research group, vehicle travel on the nation's roads increased 18% from 2000 to 2022, while new lane road mileage increased only 9% over a similar period. trip also reports that 40% of the nation's major roads are in poor or mediocre condition, while 7% of the nation's bridges are in poor/structurally deficient condition. additionally, there is an estimated backlog of $123 billion of improvements to the nation's highway system that requires an increase in annual investment from $23 billion to $57 billion for the next 20 years to address these improvements and meet mobility and modernization needs. management believes infrastructure activity for 2024 and beyond should benefit from the iij act and additional state and local infrastructure initiatives.
in addition to highways and bridges, transportation infrastructure includes aviation, mass transit, ports and waterways. railroad construction continues to benefit from economic growth, which ultimately generates a need for additional maintenance and improvements.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations erratic weather can significantly impact operations production and shipment levels for the building materials business correlate with general construction activity, most of which occurs outdoors and, as a result, is affected by erratic weather, seasonal changes and other climate-related conditions. typically, due to a general slowdown in construction activity during winter months, the first and fourth quarters experience lower production and shipment activity. as such, temperatures in the months of march and november can meaningfully affect the company's first- and fourth-quarter results, respectively, where warm and/or moderate temperatures in march and november allow the construction season to start earlier and end later, respectively. additionally, extreme heat during summer months can impact construction activities, as outdoor work may be limited to protect the health and safety of construction workers.
excessive rainfall jeopardizes production efficiencies, shipments and profitability in all markets served by the company. in particular, the company's operations in the atlantic and gulf coast regions of the united states and the bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity from june through november, but most notably in august, september and october. the company's california operations are at risk for flooding, wildfire activity and water use restrictions in severe drought conditions. increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events have been linked to climate change, and further global warming may increase the risk of adverse weather conditions.
capital investment decisions driven by capital intensity of the building materials business and focus on land the company's organic capital program is designed to leverage construction market growth through investment in both permanent and portable facilities at the company's operations. over an economic cycle, the company typically invests organic capital at an annual level that approximates depreciation expense. at mid-cycle and through cyclical peaks, organic capital investment typically exceeds depreciation expense, as the company supports current capacity needs and future growth. conversely, at a cyclical trough, the company may reduce levels of capital investment. regardless of cycle, the company sets a priority of investing capital to ensure safe, environmentally sound and efficient operations, as well as to provide the highest quality of customer service and establish a foundation for future growth.
the company is diligent in its focus on land opportunities, including potential new sites (greensites) and existing site expansion. land purchases are usually opportunistic and can include contiguous property around existing quarry locations. such property can serve as buffer property or additional mineral reserves, assuming regulatory hurdles can be cleared and the underlying geology supports economical aggregates mining. in either instance, the acquisition of additional property around an existing quarry typically allows the expansion of the quarry footprint and an extension of quarry life.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations magnesia specialties business the magnesia specialties business manufactures magnesia-based chemicals products for industrial, agricultural and environmental applications at its manistee, michigan facility. the magnesia specialties business produces and sells dolomitic lime from its woodville, ohio facility. of 2023 total magnesia specialties revenues, 66% was attributable to chemicals products, 33% was attributable to lime and 1% was attributable to stone.
in 2023, 78% of lime shipments was sold to third-party customers, while the remaining 22% was used internally as a raw material for the manufacturing of chemicals products. dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are primarily used by the domestic steel industry and, overall, 38% of magnesia specialties' 2023 total revenues was related to products used in the steel industry. accordingly, a portion of the segment's revenues and profits is affected by production and inventory trends within the steel industry, which are guided by the rate of consumer consumption, the flow of offshore imports and other economic factors. the dolomitic lime business runs most profitably at 70% or greater steel capacity utilization. domestic steel production averaged 74% of capacity in 2023 and 75% in 2022. the chemical products business focuses on higher-margin specialty chemicals that can be produced at volumes that support efficient operations.
while total revenues of the magnesia specialties business were predominantly derived from domestic customers in 2023, financial results can be affected by foreign currency exchange rates, increasing transportation costs or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. to mitigate the short-term effect of currency exchange rates, foreign transactions are denominated in united states dollars.
a significant portion of the magnesia specialties business' costs is of a fixed or semi-fixed nature. the production process requires the use of natural gas, coal and petroleum coke; therefore, fluctuations in their pricing directly affect operating results. to help mitigate this risk, the company has fixed-price agreements for 81% of its 2024 energy needs for coal, petroleum coke and natural gas. for 2023, the segment's average cost per mmbtu (1,000,000 british thermal units) of natural gas decreased 19% versus 2022. given high fixed costs, low capacity utilization can negatively affect the segment's results of operations. management expects future organic profit growth to result from increased pricing, commercialization of new products, entry into new markets and optimization of overall product mix.

environmental regulation and litigation the expansion and growth of the aggregates industry is subject to increasing challenges from environmental and political advocates aiming to control the pace and direction of future development. certain environmental groups have published lists of targeted municipal areas, including areas within the company's marketplace, for environmental and suburban growth control. the effect of these initiatives on the company's growth is typically localized. further challenges are expected as the momentum of these initiatives ebb and flow. rail and other transportation alternatives are being heralded by these special-interest groups as solutions to mitigate road traffic congestion and overcrowding.
the company's operations are subject to and affected by federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety and other regulatory matters. certain of the company's operations may occasionally use substances classified as toxic or hazardous. the company regularly monitors and reviews its operations, procedures and policies for compliance with these laws and regulations. despite these compliance efforts, risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the company's businesses, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.
environmental operating permits are, or may be, required for certain of the company's operations; such permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation. new permits are generally required for opening new sites or for expansion at existing operations and can take several years to obtain. moreover, land use, rezoning and special or conditional use permits are increasingly difficult to obtain. once a permit is issued, the location is required to generally operate in accordance with the approved site plan.
the clean air act, originally passed in 1963 and periodically updated by amendments, is the united states' national air pollution control program that granted the united states environmental protection agency (usepa) authority to set limits on the level of various air pollutants. to be in compliance with national ambient air quality standards, a defined geographic area must be below established limits for six pollutants. environmental groups have been successful in lawsuits against the federal and certain state departments of transportation, delaying highway construction in municipal areas not in compliance with the clean air act. the usepa designates geographic areas as nonattainment areas when the level of air pollutants exceeds the national standard. nonattainment areas receive deadlines to reduce air pollutants by instituting various control strategies or otherwise face fines or control by the usepa. included as nonattainment areas are several major metropolitan areas in the company's markets, such as houston/brazoria/galveston, texas; dallas/fort worth, texas; bexar county in san antonio/new braunfels, texas; denver, colorado; boulder, colorado; fort collins/greeley/loveland, colorado; atlanta, georgia; baltimore, maryland;

large emitters (facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more per year) of greenhouse gases (ghg) must report ghg generation to comply with the usepa's mandatory greenhouse gases reporting rule (ghg rule). the company in 2023 filed annual reports in accordance with the ghg rule relating to operations at its two cement plants in texas, as well as its magnesia specialties facilities in woodville, ohio, and manistee, michigan, each of which emit certain ghg, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. if congress passes additional legislation limiting ghg emissions, these operations will likely be subject to such legislation. the company believes that any increased operating costs or taxes related to ghg emission limitations at its cement or woodville operations would be passed on to its customers. the manistee facility may have to absorb extra costs due to the regulation of ghg emissions in order to maintain competitive pricing in its markets. the company cannot reasonably predict how much those increased costs may be.
the company is engaged in certain legal and administrative proceedings incidental to its normal business activities. in the opinion of management, based upon currently available facts, the likelihood is remote that the ultimate outcome of any litigation or other proceedings, including those pertaining to environmental matters, relating to the company and its subsidiaries, will have a material adverse effect on the overall results of the company's operations, cash flows or financial position.

income tax expense variances in the estimated effective income tax rates, when compared with the statutory corporate income tax rate, are due primarily to the statutory depletion deduction for mineral reserves, the effect of state income taxes, stock compensation deductions, and the impact of foreign income or losses for which no tax expense or benefit is recognized. additionally, certain acquisition-related expenses have limited deductibility for income tax purposes.
the permanent benefit associated with the statutory depletion deduction for mineral reserves is typically the significant driver of the variance in the estimated effective income tax rate compared with the statutory rate. the statutory depletion deduction is calculated as a percentage of revenues subject to certain limitations. due to these limitations, changes in sales volumes and pretax earnings may not proportionately affect the statutory depletion deduction and the corresponding impact on the effective income tax rate. however, the impact of the depletion deduction on the estimated effective tax rate is inversely affected by increases or decreases in pretax earnings.
the company's estimated effective income tax rate for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 was 19.6% and 21.5%, respectively. the lower 2023 effective income tax rate versus 2022 was primarily driven by the impact of the divestiture of the colorado and central texas ready mixed concrete businesses in 2022.

form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other financial information critical accounting policies and estimates the company's audited consolidated financial statements include certain critical estimates regarding the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. these estimates require management's subjective and complex judgments. amounts reported in the company's consolidated financial statements could differ materially if management used different assumptions in making these estimates, resulting in actual results differing from those estimates. methodologies used and assumptions selected by management in making these estimates, as well as the related disclosures, have been reviewed by and discussed with the company's audit committee. management's determination of the critical nature of accounting estimates and judgments may change from time to time depending on facts and circumstances that management cannot currently predict.
impairment review of goodwill goodwill is required to be tested annually for impairment. an interim review is performed between annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate a potential impairment. the company performs its impairment evaluation as of october 1, which represents the annual evaluation date. the impairment review of goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because goodwill (excluding goodwill allocated to assets held for sale) represented 22% of the company's total assets at december 31, 2023; the review requires management to apply judgment and make key assumptions; and an impairment charge could be material to the company's financial condition and results of operations.
certain operating segments within the building materials business meet the aggregation criteria and are consolidated into reportable segments for financial reporting. the company's reporting units, which represent the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment, are based on the operating segments of the building materials business. goodwill is assigned to the respective reporting unit(s) based on the location of acquisitions at the time of consummation. if subsequent organizational changes result in operations being transferred to a different reporting unit, a proportionate amount of goodwill is transferred from the former to the new reporting unit. for divestitures, goodwill is allocated on a proportional basis based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit remaining.
the southwest division is the most significant reporting unit and includes $1.5 billion of the company's goodwill, excluding amounts classified as held for sale. at december 31, 2023, the company allocated $260.0 million of goodwill to assets held for sale for a pending divestiture in the southwest division. there is also $1.1 billion of goodwill in the west division reporting unit. there is no goodwill related to the magnesia specialties business.
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value, which represents a step-1 analysis. however, prior to step 1, the company may perform an optional qualitative assessment, or step 0. as part of the qualitative assessment, the company considers, among other things, the following events and circumstances: macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and other business or reporting unit-specific events. if the company concludes it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) that a reporting unit's fair value is higher than its carrying value, the company does not perform any further goodwill impairment testing for that reporting unit. otherwise, it proceeds to step 1 of its goodwill impairment analysis. if the reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further calculation is necessary. a reporting unit with a carrying value in excess of its fair value constitutes a step-1 failure and results in an impairment charge. when the company validates its conclusion by measuring fair value, it may resume performing a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit in any subsequent period. the company may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly with the quantitative calculation in step 1. the company performs a step-1 analysis for all its reporting units every three years.
for the 2023 annual impairment evaluation, the company performed a step-0 analysis for all reporting units and concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that each of the reporting units' fair value exceeded its carrying value.
any potential impairment charges from future evaluations represent a risk to the company.
pension benefit obligation and pension expense - selection of assumptions the company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all employees and a supplemental excess retirement plan (serp) for certain retirees (see note j to the consolidated financial statements). annually, as of december 31, management remeasures the defined benefit pension plans' projected benefit obligation based on the present value of the projected future benefit payments to all participants for services rendered to date, reflecting expected form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations future pay increases through the participants' expected retirement dates. a discount rate assumption is selected annually based on corporate bond rates as of the measurement date to calculate the present value of the projected benefit obligation.
annual pension expense, referred to as net periodic benefit cost within the consolidated financial statements, (inclusive of serp expense) consists of several components:
•service cost, which represents the present value of benefits attributed to services rendered in the current year, measured by expected future salary levels to assumed retirement dates;
•interest cost, which represents one year's additional interest on the projected benefit obligation;
•expected return on assets, which represents the expected investment return on pension plan assets; and
•amortization of prior service cost and actuarial gains and losses, which represents components that are recognized over time rather than immediately. prior service cost represents credit given to employees for years of service already accrued. at december 31, 2023, unrecognized prior service cost was $42.4 million. management currently expects to amortize $5.9 million of the unrecognized prior service cost in 2024. actuarial gains and losses arise from changes in assumptions regarding future events, a change in the benefit obligation resulting from experience different from assumed or when actual returns on pension assets differ from expected returns. at december 31, 2023, the unrecognized actuarial loss was $63.4 million. pension accounting rules currently allow companies to amortize the portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss that represents more than 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or pension plan assets, using the average remaining service life for the amortization period. the calculation is performed on a plan-by-plan basis. management currently expects to amortize $1.5 million of the unrecognized actuarial loss in 2024.
the aforementioned components are calculated annually to determine the annual pension expense.
management believes the selection of assumptions related to the annual pension expense and related projected benefit obligation is a critical accounting estimate due to the high degree of volatility in the expense and obligation dependent on selected assumptions. the key assumptions are as follows:
•the discount rate is used to present value the projected benefit obligation and represents the current rate at which the projected benefit obligations could be effectively settled.
•the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is used to estimate future asset returns and should reflect the average rate of long-term earnings on assets invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation.
•the mortality table and mortality improvement scale represent published statistics on the expected lives of people.
•the rate of increase in future compensation levels is used to project the pay-related pension benefit formula and should estimate actual future compensation levels.
management's selection of the discount rate is based on an analysis that estimates the current rate of return for high-quality, fixed-income investments with maturities matching the payment of pension benefits that could be purchased to settle the obligations. the company selected a hypothetical portfolio of moody's aa bonds, with maturities that match the benefit obligations, to determine the discount rate. at december 31, 2023, the company selected a discount rate assumption of 5.58%, a 30-basis-point decrease compared with the december 31, 2022 assumption. of the four key assumptions, the discount rate is generally the most volatile and sensitive estimate. accordingly, a change in this assumption can have a significant impact on the annual pension expense and the projected benefit obligation.
management's selection of the rate of increase in future compensation levels, which reflects cost of living adjustments and merit and promotion increases, is generally based on the company's historical increases in pensionable earnings, while giving consideration to any future expectations. a higher rate of increase results in higher pension expense and a higher projected benefit obligation. the assumed long-term rate of increase is 4.50%.
management's selection of the expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets is based on the current asset class mix of the company's pension plan assets, current capital market conditions and a stochastic forecast of future conditions. based on the currently projected returns on these assets and related expenses, the company selected an expected return on assets of 6.75%, the same as the prior-year rate.
the following table presents the expected return on pension assets as compared with the actual return on pension assets:
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
(in millions)   expected return on pension assets   actual return on pension assets
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on pension assets is included in actuarial gains and losses, which are amortized into annual pension expense as previously described.
at december 31, 2023 and 2022, the company estimated the remaining lives of participants in the pension plans using the society of actuaries' pri-2012 base mortality table. the no-collar table was used for salaried participants and the blue-collar table was used for hourly participants, both adjusted to reflect the historical experience of the company's participants and a geospatial mortality analysis. the company selected the mp-2020 scale for mortality improvement at december 31, 2023 and 2022.

average remaining service period for participants    9 years mortality tables:
mortality improvement scale                          mp-2020
using these assumptions, the company's pension benefit obligation as of december 31, 2023 was $969.2 million and 2024 pension expense is expected to be approximately $21.0 million based on current demographics and structure of the plans. changes in the underlying assumptions would have the following estimated impact on the obligation and expected expense:
•a 25-basis-point change in the discount rate would have changed the december 31, 2023 pension benefit obligation by approximately $29.4 million.
•a 25-basis-point change in the discount rate would change the 2024 expected expense by approximately $1.2 million.
•a 25-basis-point change in the expected long-term rate of return on assets would change the 2024 expected expense by approximately $2.9 million.
the company made pension plan and serp contributions of $31.8 million in 2023 and $352.1 million during the five-year period ended december 31, 2023. in total, the company's pension plans are overfunded (fair value of plan assets exceeds the projected benefit obligation) by $207.6 million at december 31, 2023. the company's projected benefit obligation was $969.2 million at december 31, 2023, an increase of $111.6 million, or 13%, versus the prior year, driven by the lower discount rate compared with the prior year. the company expects to make pension plan and serp contributions of $32.7 million in 2024, of which $25.0 million is voluntary.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations estimated effective income tax rate the company uses the liability method to determine its provision for income taxes. accordingly, the annual provision for income taxes reflects estimates of the current liability for income taxes, estimates of the tax effect of financial reporting versus tax basis differences using statutory income tax rates and management's judgment with respect to any valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and accruals for uncertain tax positions. the result is management's estimate of the annual effective tax rate (the etr).
income for tax purposes is determined through the application of the rules and regulations under the united states internal revenue code and the statutes of various foreign, state and local tax jurisdictions in which the company conducts business. changes in the statutory tax rates and/or tax laws in these jurisdictions can have a material impact on the etr. the effect of these changes, if material, is recognized when the change is enacted.
as prescribed by these tax regulations, as well as u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, the manner in which revenues and expenses are recognized for financial reporting and income tax purposes is not always the same. therefore, these differences between the company's pretax income for financial reporting purposes and the amount of taxable income for income tax purposes are treated as either temporary or permanent, depending on their nature.
temporary differences reflect revenues or expenses that are recognized in financial reporting in one period and taxable income in a different period. an example of a temporary difference is the use of the straight-line method of depreciation of machinery and equipment for financial reporting purposes and the use of an accelerated method for income tax purposes. temporary differences result in differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of assets or liabilities and give rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities (i.e., future tax deductions or future taxable income). therefore, when temporary differences occur, they are offset by a corresponding change in a deferred tax account. as such, total income tax expense as reported in the company's consolidated statements of earnings is not changed by temporary differences.
the company has deferred tax liabilities, primarily for right-of-use assets, property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles, employee pension and postretirement benefits and partnerships and joint ventures. the deferred tax liabilities attributable to property, plant and equipment relate to accelerated depreciation and depletion methods used for income tax purposes as compared with the straight-line and units-of-production methods used for financial reporting purposes. these temporary differences will reverse over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. the deferred tax liabilities attributable to goodwill arise as a result of amortizing goodwill for income tax purposes but not for financial reporting purposes. this temporary difference reverses when goodwill is written off for financial reporting purposes, either through divestitures or an impairment charge. the timing of such events cannot be estimated. the deferred tax liabilities attributable to employee pension and postretirement benefits relate to deductions as plans are funded for income tax purposes compared with deductions for financial reporting purposes based on accounting standards. the reversal of these differences depends on the timing of the company's contributions to the related benefit plans as compared to the annual expense for financial reporting purposes. the deferred tax liabilities attributable to partnerships and joint ventures relate to the difference between the tax basis of the investments in partnerships and joint ventures when compared to the basis for financial reporting purposes. the temporary difference reverses through differences recognized over the life of the investment or through divestiture.
the company has deferred tax assets, primarily for inventories, valuation reserves, stock-based compensation awards, unrecognized losses related to the funded status of the pension and postretirement benefit plans, lease liabilities, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. the deferred tax assets attributable to inventories and valuation reserves relate to the deduction of estimated cost reserves and various period expenses for financial reporting purposes that are deductible in a later period for income tax purposes. the reversal of these differences depends on facts and circumstances, including the timing of deduction for income tax purposes for reserves previously established and the establishment of additional reserves for financial reporting purposes. the deferred tax assets attributable to unvested stock-based compensation awards relate to differences in the timing of deductibility for financial reporting purposes versus income tax purposes. for financial reporting purposes, the fair value of the awards is deducted ratably over the requisite service period. for income tax purposes, no deduction is allowed until the award is vested or no longer subject to substantial risk of forfeiture. the company reflects all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in income tax expense as a discrete event in the period in which the award vests or settles, increasing volatility in the income tax rate from period to period.
property, plant and equipment net property, plant and equipment (excluding the amount allocated to assets held for sale) represented 41% of total assets at december 31, 2023.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations aggregates mineral reserves and mineral interests are components within the property, plant and equipment balance on the consolidated balance sheets. the company evaluates aggregates reserves, including those used in the cement manufacturing process, in several ways, depending on the geology at a particular location and whether the location is a greensite, an acquisition or an existing operation. greensites require an extensive drilling program before any significant investment is made in terms of time, site development or efforts to obtain appropriate zoning and permitting (see environmental regulation and litigation section). the depth of overburden and the quality and quantity of the aggregates reserves are significant factors in determining whether to pursue opening the site. further, the estimated average selling price for products in a market is also a significant factor in concluding that reserves are economically mineable. if the company's analysis based on these factors is satisfactory, the total aggregates reserves available are calculated and a determination is made whether to open the location. reserve evaluation at existing locations is typically performed to evaluate purchasing adjoining properties, for quality control, calculating overburden volumes and for mine planning. reserve evaluation of acquisitions may require a higher degree of sampling to verify the total reserves.
well-ordered subsurface sampling of the underlying deposit is basic to determining reserves at any location. this subsurface sampling usually involves one or more types of drilling, determined by the nature of the material to be sampled and the objective of the sampling. the company's objectives are to ensure that the underlying deposit meets aggregate specifications and that the total reserves on site are sufficient for mining and economically recoverable. locations underlain with hard rock deposits, such as granite and limestone, are drilled using the diamond core method, which provides the most useful and accurate samples of the deposit. selected core samples are tested for soundness, abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregate's use and standard to the aggregates industry. the number, depth and spacing of the holes are determined by the size of the site and the complexity of the site-specific geology. some geological factors that may affect the number and depth of holes include faults, folds, chemical irregularities, clay pockets, thickness of formations and weathering.
the quality of reserves within a deposit can vary. construction contracts, for the infrastructure market in particular, include specifications related to the aggregates material properties. if a limiting characteristic in the deposit is discovered, the aggregates material may not meet the required specifications. although it is possible that the aggregates material can still be used for non-specification uses, this can have an adverse impact on the company's ability to serve certain customers or the company's profitability. in addition, other factors can arise that influence the company's ability to develop reserves, including geological occurrences, mining practices, environmental requirements and zoning ordinances.
locations underlain with sand and gravel are typically drilled using auger or sonic methods, whereby a corkscrew or hollow-stem tooling brings up material from below the ground, which is then sampled. deposits in these locations are typically limited in thickness. additionally, the deposit's quality and sand-to-gravel ratio can vary both horizontally and vertically. the extent and type of drilling is determined by the characteristics and the continuity of the deposit.
in determining the amount of reserves, evaluations are completed by or under the supervision of qualified person(s) using industry best practices and internal controls defined by the company. the designations the company uses for reserve categories, and those recognized by the aggregate industry are summarized as follows:
mineral reserves - mineral reserves are an estimate of tonnage and grade or quality that, in the opinion of a qualified person, can be the basis of an economically viable project. more specifically, it is the economically mineable part of a mineral [deposit], which includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined or extracted. reserves are categorized as proven and probable and represent net tons after consideration of applicable losses incurred during mining and plant processing.
proven reserves - proven reserves are the portion of a mineral deposit for which quantity and quality are estimated on the basis of conclusive evidence from closely spaced drilling and sampling.
probable reserves - probable reserves are estimated on the basis of less geologic evidence but are considered adequate for determining the quantity and quality.
the company's proven and probable reserves reflect reasonable economic and operating constraints and also include reserves at the company's inactive and undeveloped sites, including some sites where permitting and zoning applications will not be filed until warranted by expected future growth. the company has historically been successful in obtaining and maintaining appropriate zoning and permitting (see environmental regulation and litigation section). the company bases estimates on the information known at the time of determination and regularly reevaluates reserves whenever new information indicates a material change in reserves at one of the company's sites.
form 10-k ♦ page part ii ♦ item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mineral reserves and mineral interests, when acquired in connection with a business combination, are valued using an excess earnings approach for the life of the proven and probable reserves.
the company uses proven and probable reserves as the denominator in its units-of-production calculation to record depletion expense for its mineral reserves and mineral interests. for 2023, depletion expense was $52.8 million.
the company begins capitalizing quarry development costs at a point when reserves are determined to be proven or probable, economically mineable and when demand supports investment in the market. capitalization of these costs ceases when production commences. capitalized quarry development costs are classified as land improvements.
new mining areas may be developed at existing quarries in order to access additional reserves. when this occurs, management reviews the facts and circumstances of each situation in making a determination as to the appropriateness of capitalizing or expensing the related pre-production development costs. if the additional mining location operates in a separate and distinct area of a quarry, the costs are capitalized as quarry development costs and depreciated over the life of the uncovered reserves. further, a separate asset retirement obligation is created for additional mining areas when the liability is incurred. once a new mining area enters the production phase, all post-production stripping costs are expensed as incurred as periodic inventory production costs.
useful lives of the assets can vary depending on factors, including production levels, geographic location, portability and maintenance practices. additionally, climate and inclement weather can reduce the useful life of an asset. historically, the company has not recognized significant losses on the disposal or retirement of fixed assets.

further, increased highway construction funding pressures resulting from either federal or state issues can affect profitability. if these negatively affect transportation budgets more than in the past, construction spending could be reduced. cement is subject to cyclical supply and demand and price fluctuations.
the company's principal business serves customers in construction markets. this concentration could increase the risk of potential losses on customer receivables; however, payment bonds normally posted on public projects, together with lien rights on private projects, mitigate the risk of uncollectible receivables. the level of demand in the company's end-use markets, production levels and the management of production costs will affect the operating leverage of the building materials business and, therefore, profitability. production costs in the building materials business are also sensitive to energy and raw material prices, both directly and indirectly. diesel fuel, natural gas, coal and other consumables change production costs directly through consumption or indirectly by increased energy-related input costs, such as steel, explosives, tires and conveyor belts. fluctuating diesel fuel pricing also affects transportation costs, primarily through fuel surcharges in the company's long-haul distribution network. the magnesia specialties business is sensitive to changes in domestic steel capacity utilization as well as the absolute price and fluctuation in the cost of natural gas.
transportation in the company's long-haul network, particularly the supply of railcars and locomotive power and condition of rail infrastructure to move trains, affects the company's efficient transportation of aggregates products in certain markets, most notably texas, colorado, florida, north carolina and the gulf coast. in addition, availability of railcars and locomotives affects the company's movement of essential dolomitic lime for magnesia chemicals to both the company's plant in manistee, michigan, and its customers. the availability of trucks, drivers and railcars to transport the company's product, particularly in markets experiencing high growth and increased demand, is also a risk and pressures the associated costs.
all of the company's businesses are also subject to weather-related risks that can significantly affect production schedules and profitability. the first and fourth quarters are most adversely affected by winter weather. hurricane and cyclone activity in the atlantic ocean, pacific ocean and gulf coast generally is most active during the second, third and fourth quarters.
risks also include shipment declines resulting from economic events beyond the company's control.
in addition to the foregoing, other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this annual report include but are not limited to those listed above in item 1, "business - competition," item 1a, "risk factors," and "note a: accounting policies" and "note n: commitments and contingencies" of the "notes to financial statements" of the audited consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k.
you should consider these forward-looking statements in light of risk factors discussed in the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2023 and other filings made with the sec. all of the company's forward-looking statements should be considered in light of these factors. in addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company considers immaterial could affect the accuracy of its forward-looking statements, or adversely affect or be material to the company. all forward-looking statements are made as of the date of filing or publication and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.

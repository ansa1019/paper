item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the results of operations and financial condition of broadridge during the fiscal years ended june 30, 2023 and 2022, and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein. certain information contained in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. statements that are not historical in nature and which may be identified by the use of words such as "expects," "assumes," "projects," "anticipates," "estimates," "we believe," "could be," "on track" and other words of similar meaning, are forward-looking statements. these statements are based on management's expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed. our actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially from the results discussed in this item 7 because of various factors, including those set forth elsewhere herein. see "forward-looking statements" and "risk factors" included in part 1 of this annual report on form 10-k.
the discussion summarizing the significant factors affecting the results of operations and financial condition of broadridge during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 can be found in part ii, "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year 2022 (the "2022 annual report"), which was filed with the securities and exchange commission on august 12, 2022.
description of the company and business segments broadridge, a delaware corporation and a part of the s&p 500Â® index, is a global financial technology leader providing investor communications and technology-driven solutions to banks, broker-dealers, asset and wealth managers, public companies, investors and mutual funds. our services include investor communications, securities processing, data and analytics, and customer communications solutions. with over 60 years of experience, including over 15 years as an independent public company, we provide integrated solutions and an important infrastructure that powers the financial services industry. our solutions enable better financial lives by powering investing, governance and communications and help reduce the need for our clients to make significant capital investments in operations infrastructure, thereby allowing them to increase their focus on core business activities. our businesses operate in two reportable segments: investor communication solutions and global technology and operations.
acquisitions assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded on the company's consolidated balance sheets as of the respective acquisition date based upon the estimated fair values at such date. the results of operations of the business acquired by the company are included in the company's consolidated statements of earnings since the respective date of acquisition. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill.
during the fiscal years ended june 30, 2023 and june 30, 2022, there were no material acquisitions.
basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") and in accordance with the sec requirements for annual reports on form 10-k. these financial statements present the consolidated position of the company and include the entities in which the company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the company has investments recorded under the equity method of accounting as well as certain marketable and non-marketable securities. intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. amounts presented may not sum due to rounding. certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation where applicable.
in presenting the consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. management continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. the estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. however, actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates made by management. in management's opinion, the consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported. the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods.
beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the company changed reporting for segment revenues, segment earnings (loss) before income taxes, and segment amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property to reflect the impact of actual foreign exchange rates applicable to the individual periods presented. the presentation of these metrics for the prior periods provided in this form 10-k has been changed to conform to the current period presentation. total consolidated revenues and earnings before income taxes were not impacted. please refer to note 3, "revenue recognition" and note 21, "financial data by segment" to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10-k.
seasonality processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors comprises a large portion of our investor communication solutions business. we process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our third and fourth fiscal quarters. the recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies. this has caused our revenues, operating income, net earnings, and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. the seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor's ability to compare our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows on a fiscal quarter-by-quarter basis.
critical accounting estimates we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. the estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. however, actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
goodwill. we review the carrying value of all our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values. we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. when determining fair value of a reporting unit, we utilize the income approach which considers a discounted future cash flow analysis using various assumptions, including projections of revenues based on assumed long-term growth rates, estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular reporting unit's weighted-average cost of capital. the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows based on forecasted earnings before interest and taxes, and the selection of the terminal value growth rate and discount rate assumptions. the weighted-average cost of capital takes into account the relative weight of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and long-term debt). our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of our routine, long-range planning process. changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. we had $3,461.6 million of goodwill as of june 30, 2023. given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value of one of our reporting units could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our earnings.
the company performs a sensitivity analysis under the goodwill impairment test assuming hypothetical reductions in the fair values of our reporting units. a 10% change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows, discount rates, or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would not result in an impairment of our goodwill.
income taxes. the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). the company is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the u.s. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. the company has estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $45.1 million as of june 30, 2023 of which $7.6 million are subject to expiration in the june 30, 2026 through june 30, 2042 period. the remaining $37.5 million of carryforwards has an indefinite utilization period. in addition, the company has estimated u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $35.3 million of which $15.5 million are subject to expiration in the june 30, 2024 through june 30, 2037 period with the balance of $19.8 million having an indefinite utilization period. u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards resulting from tax losses beginning with the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019 have an indefinite carryforward under the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"). the company did not generate federal net operating losses for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023.
valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings. the company has recorded valuation allowances of $10.3 million and $10.7 million at june 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income, carryforward periods, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies. projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned. the assumptions used to project future taxable income requires significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses.
share-based payments. accounting for stock-based compensation requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. the binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. the risk-free rate is derived from the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. the binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. determining these assumptions are subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2023 stock option grants would result in an approximate $3.1 million change in total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2023 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2023 stock option grants would result in an approximate $1.7 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2023 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2023 stock option grants would result in an approximate $0.2 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2023 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period. a hypothetical one-half percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2023 stock option grants would result in an approximate $1.4 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2023 grants, which would be amortized over the vesting period.
key performance indicators management focuses on a variety of key indicators to plan, measure and evaluate the company's business and financial performance. these performance indicators include revenue and recurring revenue as well as not generally accepted accounting principles measures ("non-gaap") of adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow, recurring revenue growth constant currency, and closed sales. in addition, management focuses on select operating metrics specific to broadridge of record growth and internal trade growth, as defined below.
refer to the section "explanation and reconciliation of the company's use of non-gaap financial measures" for a reconciliation of adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow, and recurring revenue growth constant currency to the most directly comparable gaap measures, and an explanation for why these non-gaap metrics provide useful information to investors and how management uses these non-gaap metrics for operational and financial decision-making. refer to the section "results of operations" for a description of closed sales and an explanation of why closed sales is a useful performance metric for management and investors.
revenues revenues are primarily generated from fees for processing and distributing investor communications and fees for technology-enabled services and solutions. the company monitors revenue in each of our two reportable segments as a key measure of success in addressing our clients' needs. revenues from fees are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity. the level of recurring and event-driven activity the company processes directly impacts distribution revenues. while event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. event-driven revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions the company processes. event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven revenues. distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, customer communications and fulfillment services as well as broadridge retirement and workplace administrative services.
â¢organic - we define organic revenue as the recurring revenue generated from net new business and internal growth.
â¢acquired - we define acquired revenue as the recurring revenue generated from acquired services in the first twelve months following the date of acquisition. this type of growth comes as a result of our strategy to purchase, integrate, and leverage the value of assets we acquire.
revenues and recurring revenue are useful metrics for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates the company's ongoing operational performance. see "results of operations" as well as note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies" and note 3, "revenue recognition" to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10-k.
record growth and internal trade growth the company uses select operating metrics specific to broadridge of record growth and internal trade growth in evaluating its business results and identifying trends affecting its business. record growth is comprised of stock record growth and interim record growth. stock record growth (also referred to as "srg" or "equity position growth") measures the estimated annual change in positions eligible for equity proxy materials. interim record growth (also referred to as "irg" or "mutual fund/etf position growth") measures the estimated change in mutual fund and exchange traded fund positions eligible for interim communications. these metrics are calculated from equity proxy and mutual fund/etf position data reported to broadridge for the same issuers or funds in both the current and prior year periods.
internal trade growth represents the estimated change in daily average trade volumes for broadridge securities processing clients whose contracts are linked to trade volumes and who were on broadridge's trading platforms in both the current and prior year periods. record growth and internal trade growth are useful non-financial metrics for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates broadridge's ongoing operational performance within its investor communication solutions and global technology and operations reportable segments, respectively.
the key performance indicators for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2023, and 2022, are as follows:
select operating metrics years ended june 30,
record growth equity positions (stock records)                            9    %                       18    %

results of operations the following discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments refer to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022. the analysis of consolidated statements of earnings should be read in conjunction with the analysis of reportable segments, which provides a more detailed discussion concerning certain components of the consolidated statements of earnings. discussions of analysis of consolidated statements of earnings and analysis of reportable segments for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2021 is disclosed in part ii, "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of the 2022 annual report.
"amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property" and "acquisition and integration costs" represent certain non-cash amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets and purchased intellectual property assets, as well as certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company's acquisition activities, respectively.
"investment gains" represent non-operating, non-cash gains on privately held investments.
"real estate realignment and covid-19 related expenses" are comprised of two major components: real estate realignment expenses, and covid-19 related expenses. real estate realignment expenses are expenses associated with the exit of certain of the company's leased facilities in response to the covid-19 pandemic, which consist of the impairment of certain right of use assets, leasehold improvements and equipment, as well as other related facility exit expenses directly resulting from, and attributable to, the exit of these leased facilities. covid-19 related expenses are direct and incremental expenses incurred by the company to protect the health and safety of broadridge associates during the covid-19 outbreak, including expenses associated with monitoring the temperatures for associates entering our facilities, enhancing the safety of our office environment in preparation for workers to return to company facilities on a more regular basis, ensuring proper social distancing in our production facilities, personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning measures in our facilities, and other safety related expenses.
"restructuring charges" represent severance costs associated with the company's initiative to streamline our management structure, reallocate work to lower cost locations, and reduce headcount in deprioritized areas.
"russia-related exit costs" are direct and incremental costs associated with the company's wind down of business activities in russia in response to russia's invasion of ukraine, including relocation-related expenses of impacted associates.
"net new business" refers to recurring revenue from closed sales for the initial twelve-month contract period after which the client goes live with the company's service(s), less recurring revenue from client losses.
"internal growth" is a component of recurring revenue and generally reflects year over year changes in existing services to our existing customers' multi-year contracts beyond the initial twelve-month period in which it was included in net new business.
"recurring revenue growth constant currency" refers to our recurring revenue growth presented on a constant currency basis to exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations.
the following definitions describe the company's revenues:
revenues in the investor communication solutions segment are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity, in addition to distribution revenues. the level of recurring and event-driven activity we process directly impacts revenues. while event-driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. the types of services we provide that comprise event-driven activity are:
â¢mutual fund proxy: the proxy and related services we provide to mutual funds when certain events occur requiring a shareholder vote including changes in directors, sub-advisors, fee structures, investment restrictions, and mergers of funds.
â¢mutual fund communications: mutual fund communications services consist primarily of the distribution on behalf of mutual funds of supplemental information required to be provided to the annual mutual fund prospectus as a result of certain triggering events such as a change in portfolio managers. in addition, mutual fund communications consist of notices and marketing materials such as newsletters.
â¢equity proxy contests and specials, corporate actions, and other: the proxy services we provide in connection with shareholder meetings driven by special events such as proxy contests, mergers and acquisitions, and tender/exchange offers.
event-driven revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process. event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven revenues. as such, the timing and level of event-driven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast.
generally, mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of event-driven activity. during fiscal year 2023, mutual fund proxy revenues were 51% lower than the prior fiscal year. during fiscal year 2022, mutual fund proxy revenues were 57% greater than the prior fiscal year. although it is difficult to forecast the levels of event-driven activity, we expect that the portion of revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future.
distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, customer communications and fulfillment services, as well as broadridge retirement and workplace administrative services.
distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postage-related expenses incurred in connection with our investor communication solutions segment, as well as broadridge retirement and workplace administrative services expenses. these costs are reflected in cost of revenues.
closed sales represent an estimate of the expected annual recurring revenue for new client contracts that were signed by broadridge in the current reporting period. closed sales does not include event-driven or distribution activity. we consider contract terms, expected client volumes or activity, knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our clients, among other factors, when determining the estimate. management uses closed sales to measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs, as an indicator of expected future revenues and as a performance metric in determining incentive compensation.
closed sales is not a measure of financial performance under gaap, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or other income statement data prepared in accordance with gaap. closed sales is a useful metric for investors in understanding how management measures and evaluates our ongoing operational performance.
the inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as actual achieved closed sales. larger closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months or longer to convert to revenues, particularly for the services provided by our global technology and operations segment. for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2023 and june 30, 2022, we reported closed sales net of a 5.0% allowance adjustment. consequently, our reported closed sales amounts will not be adjusted for actual revenues achieved because these adjustments are estimated in the period the sale is reported. we assess this allowance amount at the end of each fiscal year to establish the appropriate allowance for the subsequent year using the trailing five years actual data as the starting point, normalized for outlying factors, if any, to enhance the accuracy of the allowance.
for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2023 and 2022, closed sales were $245.8 million and $279.5 million, respectively. the fiscal years ended june 30, 2023 and 2022, are net of an allowance adjustment of $12.9 million and $14.8 million, respectively.
recent developments new sec rule on tailored shareholder reports on october 26, 2022, the sec adopted a rule modifying mutual fund and exchange-traded fund investor communications. the sec rule requires that shorter summary documents, referred to as tailored shareholder reports, be distributed in lieu of long-form annual and semi-annual fund reports or notices of the availability of such reports, which the sec had permitted under rule 30e-3. the rule went into effect on january 24, 2023 and includes an 18-month transition period for implementation by mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, with a final compliance date of july 24, 2024. we are reviewing the full impact of the new rule, however we currently estimate a reduction in our annual recurring revenues of approximately $30 million phasing in over fiscal years 2025 and 2026, assuming no offset from new services. see the risk factor titled "our clients are subject to complex laws and regulations, and new laws or regulations and/or changes to existing laws or regulations could impact our clients and, in turn, adversely impact our business or may reduce our profitability." in part i, item 1a. "risk factors" in this annual report.
conflict in ukraine we are monitoring the events related to russia's invasion of ukraine and have been actively managing any exposure we may have through a cross-functional taskforce that includes members of our senior management. we have historically had a limited presence in russia, and we have no presence in ukraine. we do not store any client data in russia. prior to the conflict, we had approximately 280 associates in st. petersburg, russia who provided software development and support services for several of our gto products, less than 2% of our total associates. as of june 30, 2023, we do not have any associates remaining in russia. we have historically provided services to a very small number of russian entities and subsidiaries of russian entities. the revenues from those services represented less than 0.1% of our total revenues in fiscal year 2022 and 2023 and our outstanding accounts receivable from these entities is de minimis. we are in the process of terminating and winding down these relationships and have closed our operations in russia. we have moved the services provided in russia to other locations in europe and asia. we are monitoring and believe we are in compliance with all global sanctions arising out of russia's invasion of ukraine. we have taken actions to enhance our information security defenses in response to the ukraine conflict. at present, we do not expect the ukraine conflict and the actions we are taking in response to have a material impact on our core operations or financial results.

â¢recurring revenues increased $264.0 million, or 7%, to $3,986.7 million. recurring revenue growth constant currency (non-gaap) was 9%, all organic, driven by net new business growth and internal growth in both ics and gto.
â¢event-driven revenues decreased $58.3 million, or 22%, primarily due to the decrease in volume of mutual fund proxy communications.
â¢distribution revenues increased $146.2 million, or 9%, driven by the impact of postage rate increases of $120.8 million and the impact of modestly higher mail volumes, primarily in customer communications solutions.
â¢cost of revenues - the increase of $158.6 million in cost of revenues primarily reflects the impact of higher postage and distribution expenses in our investor communication solutions segment of $169.4 million, offset by lower acquisition amortization of $35.8 million.
â¢selling, general and administrative expenses - the increase of $16.7 million in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflects higher compensation expenses of $21.8 million and higher technology related expenses of $4.3 million, offset by lower external labor costs.
interest expense, net. interest expense, net, was $135.5 million, an increase of $50.9 million from $84.7 million in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 primarily due to an increase in interest expense from higher borrowing costs.
other non-operating income (expenses), net. other non-operating expense, net for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 was $6.0 million, compared to $3.0 million of other non-operating expense, net for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022. the increased expense was primarily due to higher net gains on investments in the prior year period.
provision for income taxes.
â¢effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 - 20.7%.
â¢effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 - 19.8%.
the increase in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2022 was driven by the lower excess tax benefit related to equity compensation as compared to the prior year.
analysis of reportable segments broadridge has two reportable segments: (1) investor communication solutions and (2) global technology and operations.
the primary component of "other" are certain gains, losses, corporate overhead expenses and non-operating expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, such as interest expense.
certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. because the company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the company may elect to record certain segment-related operating and non-operating expense items in other rather than reflect such items in segment profit.

explanation and reconciliation of the company's use of non-gaap financial measures the company's results in this annual report on form 10-k are presented in accordance with u.s. gaap except where otherwise noted. in certain circumstances, non-gaap results have been presented. these non-gaap measures are adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow, and recurring revenue growth constant currency. these non-gaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the company's reported results.
the company believes our non-gaap financial measures help investors understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the company's business performance. management believes that non-gaap measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors' understanding of the company's operating results and trends by providing an additional basis for comparison. management uses these non-gaap financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. in addition, and as a consequence of the importance of these non-gaap financial measures in managing our business, the company's compensation committee of the board of directors incorporates non-gaap financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation.
adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share these non-gaap measures reflect operating income, operating income margin, net earnings, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items the exclusion of which management believes provides insight regarding our ongoing operating performance. depending on the period presented, these adjusted measures exclude the impact of certain of the following items: (i) amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property, (ii) acquisition and integration costs, (iii) restructuring charges, (iv) real estate realignment and covid-19 related expenses, (v) russia-related exit costs, and (vi) investment gain. amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property represents non-cash amortization expenses associated with the company's acquisition activities. acquisition and integration costs represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the company's acquisition activities. restructuring charges represent severance costs associated with the company's initiative to streamline our management structure, reallocate work to lower cost locations, and reduce headcount in deprioritized areas. real estate realignment and covid-19 related expenses are comprised of two major components: real estate realignment expenses, and covid-19 related expenses. real estate realignment expenses are expenses associated with the exit of certain of the company's leased facilities in response to the covid-19 pandemic, which consist of the impairment of certain right of use assets, leasehold improvements and equipment, as well as other related facility exit expenses directly resulting from, and attributable to, the exit of these leased facilities. covid-19 related expense are direct and incremental expenses incurred by the company to protect the health and safety of broadridge associates during the covid-19 outbreak, including expenses associated with monitoring the temperatures for associates entering our facilities, enhancing the safety of our office environment in preparation for workers to return to company facilities on a more regular basis, ensuring proper social distancing in our production facilities, personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning measures in our facilities, and other safety related expenses. russia-related exit costs are direct and incremental costs associated with the company's wind down of business activities in russia in response to russia's invasion of ukraine, including relocation-related expenses of impacted associates. investment gain represents a non-operating, non-cash gain on a privately held investment.
we exclude acquisition and integration costs, restructuring charges, real estate realignment and covid-19 related expenses, russia-related exit costs, and investment gain from our adjusted operating income (as applicable) and other adjusted earnings measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and enhances comparability across fiscal reporting periods, as these items are not reflective of our underlying operations or performance. we also exclude the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property, as these non-cash amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of individual acquisitions and do not factor into the company's capital allocation decisions, management compensation metrics or multi-year objectives. furthermore, management believes that this adjustment enables better comparison of our results as amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property will not recur in future periods once such intangible assets have been fully amortized. although we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property from our adjusted earnings measures, our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that these intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.
free cash flow in addition to the non-gaap financial measures discussed above, we provide free cash flow information because we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions, other investments, as well as debt servicing. free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure and is defined by the company as net cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures as well as software purchases and capitalized internal use software.
recurring revenue growth constant currency as a multi-national company, we are subject to variability of our reported u.s. dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. the exclusion of the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations from our recurring revenue growth, or what we refer to as amounts expressed "on a constant currency basis," is a non-gaap measure. we believe that excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations from our recurring revenue growth provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods.
changes in recurring revenue growth expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. to present this information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar are translated into u.s. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the comparative year, rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year.

in march 2021, the company entered into a term credit agreement (as amended on december 23, 2021 and may 23, 2023, "term credit agreement"), providing for term loan commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $2.55 billion, comprised of a $1.0 billion tranche ("tranche 1") and a $1.55 billion tranche ("tranche 2," together with tranche 1, the "fiscal 2021 term loans"). the tranche 1 loans were repaid in full in may 2021. the tranche 2 loans will mature in may 2024 on the third anniversary of the funding date. the proceeds of the fiscal 2021 term loans were used by the company to solely finance the itiviti acquisition and pay certain fees and expenses in connection therewith. interest on the outstanding portion of the fiscal 2021 term loans bears interest at adjusted term sofr plus 1.100% per annum (subject to step-ups to adjusted term sofr plus 1.350% or a step-down to sofr plus 0.850% based on ratings). on may 23, 2023, we amended the interest rate index from libor to adjusted sofr. all other terms remained unchanged.
the fiscal 2021 revolving credit facility, fiscal 2021 term loans, fiscal 2016 senior notes, fiscal 2020 senior notes and fiscal 2021 senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and are ranked equally in right of payment.

the increase in cash provided by operating activities of $379.9 million was primarily due to an increase in advance client billings as well as a decrease in client-related platform implementation and development, partially offset by higher cash used in working capital.
the decrease in cash used in investing activities of $30.0 million primarily reflects lower acquisition spend in the current fiscal year compared to the prior year period.
the increase in cash used in financing activities of $344.0 million primarily reflects higher repayments net of borrowing.
income taxes the company, headquartered in the u.s., is routinely examined by the irs and is also routinely examined by the tax authorities in the u.s. states and foreign countries in which it conducts business. the tax years under audit examination vary by tax jurisdiction. the company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations. to the extent the company determines it has potential tax assessments in particular tax jurisdictions, the company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments. once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available, when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired. the resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the financial condition of the company or on the company's consolidated statements of earnings for a particular future period.
employee benefit plans the company sponsors a supplemental officer retirement plan (the "sorp"), a supplemental executive retirement plan (the "serp"), an executive retiree health insurance plan, and certain non-us benefits-related plans. please refer to note 17, "employee benefit plans" to our consolidated financial statements under item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion on the company's employee benefit plans.

in addition, as of june 30, 2023, the company also has a future commitment to fund $0.6 million to one of the company's other investees.
other commercial agreements certain of the company's subsidiaries established unsecured, uncommitted lines of credit with banks. there were no outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit at june 30, 2023.
off-balance sheet arrangements it is not our business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. however, we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. we manage our exposure to these market risks through regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments.
in january 2022, we executed a series of cross-currency swap derivative contracts with an aggregate notional amount of eur 880 million which are designated as net investment hedges to hedge a portion of our net investment in our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro. the cross-currency swap derivative contracts are agreements to pay fixed-rate interest in euros and receive fixed-rate interest in u.s. dollars, thereby effectively converting a portion of our u.s. dollar denominated fixed-rate debt into euro denominated fixed-rate debt. the cross-currency swaps mature in may 2031 to coincide with the maturity of the fiscal 2021 senior notes. accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the qualifying net investment hedge instruments are recorded as foreign currency translation within other comprehensive income (loss), net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or complete liquidation of the underlying foreign subsidiary. at june 30, 2023, our position on the cross-currency swaps was an asset of $66.7 million, and is recorded as part of other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets with the offsetting amount recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. we have elected the spot method of accounting whereby the net interest savings from the cross-currency swaps is recognized as a reduction in interest expense in our consolidated statements of earnings.
in connection with the acquisition of itiviti in march 2021 the company entered into two derivative instruments designed to mitigate the company's exposure to the impact of (i) changes in foreign exchange rates on the acquisition of itiviti purchase consideration, and (ii) changes in interest rates on the fiscal 2021 senior notes.
in march 2021, the company executed a forward foreign exchange derivative instrument ("forward") with an aggregate notional amount of eur 1.955 billion. the forward acted as an economic hedge against the impact of changes in the euro on the company's purchase consideration for the acquisition of itiviti. the company recorded changes in fair value of the forward as part of other non-operating income (expenses), net in the consolidated statement of earnings. in may 2021, the company settled the forward derivative for a cumulative pre-tax gain of $66.7 million.
in may 2021, we settled a forward treasury lock agreement that was designated as a cash flow hedge, for a pre-tax loss of $11.0 million, after which the final settlement loss is being amortized into interest expense, net ratably over the ten year term of the fiscal 2021 senior notes. the expected amount of the existing loss that will be amortized into earnings before income taxes within the next twelve months is approximately $1.1 million.
in the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our products and services. we do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties, or collateral arrangements.

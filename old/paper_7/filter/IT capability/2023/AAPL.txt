critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") and the company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company's management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies" of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
uncertain tax positions the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. the evaluation of the company's uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of gaap and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. although management believes the company's reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the company's reserves. reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on the company's financial condition and operating results.
legal and other contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on the company's financial condition and operating results.

highlights net sales were approximately $17.7 billion in 2022, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year, driven by higher selling prices resulting from continued selling price initiatives. the company increased net sales despite softer demand conditions in europe due in part to geopolitical issues, pandemic-related demand disruptions in china and unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts due to the strong appreciation of the u.s. dollar versus many foreign currencies.
income before income taxes was $1,381 million in 2022, a decrease of $434 million compared to the prior year. this decrease was primarily due to raw material and other cost inflation, lower sales volumes, unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts, higher manufacturing costs related to supply and labor disruptions and impairment and other related charges, partially offset by increased selling prices.

performance coatings net sales increased due to the following:
● acquisition-related sales (+3%)
● unfavorable foreign currency translation (-5%)
● divestiture-related sales and the wind down of russia operations (-1%)
in 2022, all businesses within the performance coatings reportable business segment achieved higher selling prices consistent with our focus on mitigating raw material and other cost inflation. these price increases also helped to offset softer demand conditions in europe due in part to geopolitical issues, the impact of pandemic-related restrictions in china, softening do-it-yourself ("diy") demand and unfavorable foreign currency translation.
architectural coatings - emea net sales, excluding the impact of currency, acquisitions, divestitures and the wind down of russia operations ("organic sales") were flat compared to prior year as selling price increases were offset by lower sales volumes. sales were negatively impacted by geopolitical uncertainty, including the war in ukraine, lower demand for diy paint products and unfavorable foreign currency translation.
architectural coatings - americas and asia pacific organic sales increased a mid-single-digit percentage during the year primarily due to selling price increases that more than offset lower sales volumes. sales in the u.s. and canada were unfavorably impacted by raw material availability, which improved as the year progressed, and softening diy demand. in mexico, ppg comex architectural coatings organic sales increased compared to the prior year as concessionaire network demand continued to be strong throughout 2022 and further selling price increases were implemented.
automotive refinish coatings organic sales increased by a high-single-digit percentage due to selling price increases in all regions and volume growth in the u.s. stemming from higher miles driven, increased collision claims and more people returning to office work versus 2021. sales were negatively impacted by softer demand in europe and the impact of pandemic-related restrictions in china.
aerospace coatings organic sales increased by a high-teen-percentage due to increased selling prices and sales volumes in all regions. sales volumes increased in all regions compared to prior year, but still remain below pre-pandemic levels. net sales benefited from continued strong demand for military applications and for ppg's technology-advantaged products.
organic sales in the protective and marine coatings business were higher by a mid-single-digit percentage due to selling price increases in all regions. sales were negatively affected by pandemic-related restrictions in china.
segment income decreased $92 million year over year primarily due to raw material and logistics cost inflation, lower sales volumes and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by higher selling prices, savings from previously approved restructuring actions and acquisition-related earnings.
looking ahead in the first quarter 2023, demand conditions in europe and china are expected to remain similar to the fourth quarter 2022, including potential pandemic-related disruptions. raw material and transportation availability continue to improve, with the biggest challenges remaining in the aerospace coatings business. aggregate sales volumes are anticipated to be lower by a mid-single-digit percentage compared to the first quarter 2022 driven by the unfavorable impacts in europe and china and continued soft architectural coatings diy demand. the impact of divestiture-related sales and sales related to the russia business, which the company is in the process of winding down, are anticipated to reduce sales by about $40 million. the company will continue to focus on executing various existing cost-savings initiatives.

in 2022, all businesses within the industrial coatings reportable business segment achieved higher selling prices consistent with our focus on mitigating raw material and other cost inflation. these price increases also helped to offset softer demand conditions in europe due in part to geopolitical issues, the impact of pandemic-related restrictions in china and unfavorable foreign currency translation.
automotive oem coatings organic sales increased by more than 10% led by higher selling prices in all regions and higher sales volumes in the u.s. and latin america. sales were unfavorably impacted by industry-wide production disruptions due to semiconductor chip shortages, which continued in 2022 but improved as the year progressed. sales volumes were also impacted by lower automotive industry production due to the geopolitical uncertainty in europe and the impact of pandemic-related disruptions in china.
for the industrial coatings business, organic sales increased by a high-single-digit percentage year over year as strong selling price increases in all regions and solid volume growth in the u.s. and latin america were partially offset by reduced sales volumes in china and europe reflecting lower economic activity in those regions.
packaging coatings organic sales increased by a high-single-digit percentage year over year due to higher selling prices in all regions. sales volumes were strong in the u.s. but were negatively impacted by geopolitical uncertainty in europe and pandemic-related restrictions in china.
segment income decreased $37 million year over year primarily due to raw material and logistics cost inflation, lower sales volumes and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by higher selling prices and savings from previously approved restructuring actions.
looking ahead in the first quarter 2023, global industrial production is expected to remain at lower levels. in china, pandemic-related disruptions are expected to continue into the first quarter. aggregate sales volumes are anticipated to decline by a mid-single-digit percentage compared to the first quarter 2022. sales volumes are expected to be similar to the prior year quarter in the automotive oem coatings business but lower in the industrial coatings, packaging coatings, and specialty coatings and materials businesses. positive selling price is expected to continue, although some of the strong selling prices realized in 2022 will begin to reach their anniversary in the first quarter. year-over-year segment margins are expected to continue to improve on a sequential basis in the first quarter 2023. the company will continue to focus on executing against various existing cost-savings initiatives.
review and outlook ppg's net sales, excluding foreign currency translation impact, increased approximately 10% versus the prior year and were a record $17.7 billion. organic sales increased by about 8% driven by higher selling prices, partially offset by lower sales volumes. acquisition-related sales contributed 3% to net sales growth compared to prior year as the company benefited from four strategic acquisitions that were completed in 2021. foreign currency translation was unfavorable for the year and impacted net sales by about 5%. during 2022, severe cost inflation, supply disruptions, geopolitical issues in europe and continuing impacts from the pandemic significantly impacted net sales and earnings. there was partial recovery in the end-use markets that were impacted by mobility restrictions in 2020 and 2021, such as automotive oem, automotive refinish coatings and aerospace coatings, but all three remained below 2019 global demand levels. demand
2022 ppg annual report and form 10-k 20
was mixed by geographic region. in the u.s. and canada and latin america regions, demand was solid throughout the year in most businesses despite supply disruptions constraining sales more than other regions. demand was the softest in europe due in part to geopolitical issues, including the war in ukraine, with the largest impact on the architectural coatings business. in asia, demand was mixed, as activity in china was impacted by ongoing pandemic-related restrictions and associated disruptions, while demand conditions in the rest of asia were more stable. despite ongoing component shortages that constrained global automotive oem manufacturers' production, global builds increased by about 6% versus 2021 due to strong underlying demand in most regions and supply deficits that are expected to remain into 2023. raw material cost inflation trended higher for most of the year, finishing the fourth quarter about 35% above fourth quarter 2019 levels. in the fourth quarter 2022, raw material inflation began to moderate and is anticipated to ease further in 2023. some other key costs continued to increase in 2022, including logistics, employee wage and benefit costs, and energy costs. the company continued to collaborate with its customers to implement selling price increases to mitigate elevated input costs, resulting in an 11% increase in selling prices compared to 2021.
u.s. and canada in 2022, economic activity remained robust and continued to recover from the lower demand levels experienced in 2021 due to pandemic-related restrictions. for the full year, u.s. gross domestic product ("gdp") and industrial production increased by approximately 2% and 4%, respectively. demand in the residential and commercial construction markets was strong at the beginning of the year but softened as interest rates increased as the year progressed. new home starts decreased by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2022 versus a mid-teen percentage increase in 2021. residential remodeling was down by approximately 10% in 2022 versus 2021 as solid housing fundamentals were offset by the impact of higher interest rates. commercial construction was down approximately 10% compared to 2021. market demand for architectural paint continued to shift back to do-it-for-me ("difm") from the diy channel during the year as lower u.s. unemployment and increased mobility resulted in consumers choosing to hire professional paint contractors. earnings were aided by strong selling price increases, but negatively impacted by higher levels of inflation, including historically high raw material cost inflation and higher than normal salary and wage increases due to the high level of employment in the u.s. architectural coatings sales volumes in the u.s. and canada were negatively impacted by severe raw material shortages that prevented the company from meeting the demand for its architectural products, mostly impacting the higher demand periods of spring and summer.
automotive oem industry builds were up nearly 10% compared to 2021 as component shortages began to moderate and underlying demand for new automobiles was solid. the aerospace coatings business continued what is expected to be a multi-year recovery to return to 2019 activity levels. before the pandemic, the company's sales mix was approximately 70% commercial and 30% military. during the pandemic and through 2022, sales volumes for military applications remained solid, in part due to specification of ppg products with advantaged technology. the commercial segment remains down about 15%, as overall improved flying activity still remains below 2019 levels, mostly impacted by lower activity in china. with the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions in china, it is expected that global commercial aftermarket and new build demand will continue to improve in 2023. the automotive refinish coatings business experienced strong demand through the year as miles driven and collision claims trended closer to pre-pandemic levels. sales were constrained due to ongoing supply disruptions, which has led to lower industry inventory levels. the packaging coatings business was favorably impacted by new business wins at several new packaged beverage can customers and overall solid demand for the company's sustainable products. the traffic solutions business, which represents the ennis-flint acquisition completed in december 2020, made good progress realizing synergies and achieved a low-teen percentage growth in organic sales.
u.s. and canada organic sales increased by more than 10% compared to 2021 driven by higher selling prices in all businesses. solid year-over-year sales volume increases in the aerospace, automotive refinish, industrial, automotive oem and packaging coatings businesses were partially offset by lower year-over-year sales volumes in the architectural and protective and marine coatings businesses. aggregate regional sales volumes remain more than 10% lower than the fourth quarter 2019. the u.s. and canada remained ppg's largest region, with sales of $7.4 billion, representing approximately 42% of 2022 net sales.
europe, middle east and africa european demand for coatings softened in 2022, mostly impacted by geopolitical issues and high levels of inflation. supply chain disruptions lessened during 2022 but continued to impact certain end-use markets, most notably automotive oem. in the first quarter, activity in this region was negatively impacted by mobility restrictions associated with pandemic-related disruptions. while the impact of the pandemic eased throughout the year, consumer confidence worsened as the year progressed due to elevated costs and the war in ukraine, which significantly impacted demand for coating products. component shortages continued to constrain automotive oem sales volumes. automotive builds in 2022 were at similar levels as 2021. architectural coatings - emea organic sales were flat compared to the prior year as selling price increases were offset by lower sales volumes. net sales for architectural difm products improved as compared to the prior year. integration of the june 2021 acquisition of tikkurila continued with good progress toward realizing targeted

synergies. in addition, the integration efforts continued for the two automotive oem acquisitions made in 2021, wörwag and cetelon, with ppg continuing to realize acquisition-related synergies and leverage acquired product technologies to drive sales growth. net sales were aided by partial recovery in the aerospace and automotive refinish coatings businesses. demand was soft for architectural coatings, packaging coatings and general industrial coatings products.
emea net sales of $5.5 billion represented 31% of ppg's 2022 net sales, modestly higher than 2021. organic sales improved by a mid-single-digit percentage compared to 2021 led by higher selling prices and acquisition-related sales, which were partially offset by lower sales volumes. net sales, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, increased by a low-teen percentage. sales volumes in the region were down a mid-teen percentage compared to 2019.
net sales were $2.8 billion in the asia pacific region, led by china, which remained ppg's second largest country by revenue. net sales in 2022 decreased by 5% compared to 2021 as higher selling prices and solid sales volume growth in india were more than offset by lower sales volumes in china due to pandemic-related restrictions and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation. sales activity was most impacted in china during a period of heightened mandated shut-downs in the second quarter and during the fourth quarter as the country began to move away from its zero-covid policy. in china, demand for coatings products is expected to improve in 2023 driven by stronger domestic consumption and fewer mobility restrictions. in the region, sales volumes were most unfavorable in the protective and marine, industrial, automotive refinish and packaging coatings businesses. in 2022, there were periods of strong automotive retail sales activity, partially due to government stimulus and strong sales of electric vehicles in china. during 2022, sales volume growth was strongest in india as the easing of pandemic-related restrictions led to increased economic activity. sales volumes in the region were lower by about 10% compared to 2021 and were lower by a mid-teen-percentage compared to 2019.
net sales in latin america in 2022 were $2.0 billion, representing a 16% increase compared to 2021. overall, demand in the region increased year over year driven by improved economic activity in most end-use markets. organic sales were higher by a mid-teen-percentage compared to 2021 due to higher selling prices and sales volumes. the ppg comex business made strong contributions, which continued to outpace the industry. the business added more concessionaire locations during 2022, bringing the total to over 5,100 locations. additionally, both reportable segments delivered sales volume growth on a year-over-year basis. sales volumes in the region increased by a low-single-digit percentage compared to 2019.
outlook we expect softening global economic activity in 2023 that will likely be uneven by region and end-use. as 2023 progresses, we expect demand for architectural coatings products in the u.s. to be negatively impacted by higher interest rates, while we anticipate demand to gradually improve in china as it transitions away from zero-covid policies and supply chain disruptions continue to ease. in europe, we expect demand to remain soft due to ongoing geopolitical issues and inflation. in general, most end-use markets do not have significant excess inventories, and any demand improvement should lead to a faster ramp-up of sales volumes. continued recovery is expected in the automotive refinish, automotive oem and aerospace coatings businesses, which collectively accounted for about 40% of the company's pre-pandemic sales and where the company has broad, global businesses supported by advantaged technologies.
supply chain and pandemic-related disruptions experienced during the past three years are expected to ease as 2023 progresses, which should allow for ample supply of commodity-related raw materials in all regions. we also expect the company's ability to manufacture and deliver product to improve as the year progresses, leading to better manufacturing efficiencies.
we anticipate that ppg's growth in the u.s. and canada will be led by the aerospace coatings, automotive refinish coatings and traffic solutions businesses. automotive oem industry builds in the region are expected to increase slightly compared to 2022. architectural coatings demand is expected to moderate and may fall as the year progresses due to higher interest rates, lower single-family home construction and lower sales of existing homes. traffic solutions and protective coatings demand should be aided later in 2023 as infrastructure spending continues to gain momentum.
we expect european industry demand trends in 2023 to remain similar to those experienced in the second half of 2022. automotive oem builds are expected to increase modestly from historical lows, and aerospace demand is expected to continue to recover from its pandemic lows. overall demand is expected to be similar to 2022 but mixed by country in the architectural coatings business. the integration of tikkurila will continue, and synergies from recent acquisitions should aid earnings growth. unfavorable demand trends are expected to continue to impact the packaging, protective and marine, and industrial coatings businesses. we will continue to monitor the impacts of higher energy prices and challenges with respect to energy procurement in europe and adapt our footprint, as necessary, to best serve our
2022 ppg annual report and form 10-k 22
customers. raw material availability is expected to continue to improve as the year progresses. a new cost savings program was announced in the third quarter 2022, which has a higher concentration of initiatives focused on europe. we continue to monitor the economic environment in the u.k. as its exit from the european union progresses, including monitoring the impacts on consumer sentiment, logistics, labor availability and coatings demand. to date, the u.k.'s exit from the european union has not had a material impact on the company's operations.
in the asia pacific region, we expect economic activity to improve in china after the first quarter as supply chain activity and mobility levels move closer to 2019 levels. stimulus support is expected in the region to aid economic activity. economic output in india is expected to remain robust, and activity in southeast asia is expected to benefit from the reopening of china's borders. in china, we expect growth above the global average despite challenges in the real estate market and heightened risks as the chinese economy continues to rely more on domestic consumption. the growth of china's electric vehicle subsegment, including significant opportunities for export activity, should benefit the company's automotive oem business. marine coatings new-build demand is expected to be stable as order books for large vessels and container ships remain close to multi-year highs.
in latin america, we anticipate continued stable economic conditions in mexico, most of central america and south america compared to 2022. we expect continued strong demand in the ppg comex architectural coatings business.
significant other factors we made significant progress on the global restructuring programs that were announced in 2019, 2020 and 2021. the 2019 and 2020 programs have been substantially completed. in the third quarter 2022, the company approved a business restructuring plan which included actions to reduce its global cost structure in response to current economic conditions. total restructuring savings, including the impact of acquisition synergies, was approximately $65 million in 2022. total restructuring savings are expected to be at least $60 million in 2023. we will continue to monitor and aggressively manage the company's cost structure to ensure alignment with the overall demand environment.
raw materials are our most significant input cost. ppg experiences fluctuating energy and raw material costs driven by various factors, including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories, global industry activity levels, foreign currency exchange rates, and global supply and demand factors.
on an aggregate basis, average raw material costs were significantly higher in 2022 versus 2021. the increases in raw material costs were primarily driven by ongoing supply constraints, including various force majeure declarations, higher energy prices, production outages at many of our suppliers, energy surcharges in europe, labor availability challenges, transportation shortages and higher ocean freight costs. ppg currently expects raw material costs to be higher by a low-single-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter 2023; however, we expect the negative impact of raw material inflation to lessen as 2023 progresses.
we achieved selling price improvement across all businesses in 2022, reflecting the company's efforts to offset various inflationary pressures. the company will carefully monitor all costs during 2023 and assess the need for additional selling price increases.
in 2022, we experienced unfavorable foreign currency translation throughout the year, and we expect that foreign currency rates will continue to be volatile. however, the company generally purchases raw materials, incurs manufacturing costs and sells finished goods in the same currency, so we typically incur only modest foreign currency transaction-related impacts.
net periodic pension expense will be higher in 2023, primarily due to declines in the market value of pension investments during 2022, resulting in a lower asset base to generate returns on plan assets in 2023. the interest cost component of pension expense will also be higher due to an increase in discount rates.
over the past five years, the company used over $2 billion of cash to repurchase approximately 21 million shares of ppg stock, including using $190 million to repurchase shares of ppg stock during 2022. the company ended the year with approximately $1.1 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization. during 2022, the company deployed $114 million for acquisitions, $518 million for capital expenditures and $570 million for dividends. in 2022, ppg marked the 51st annual per share dividend increase and the 123rd successive year of annual dividend payments.
ppg ended 2022 with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. the company expects strong cash generation in 2023.

commitments and contingent liabilities, including environmental matters ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. refer to item 3. "legal proceedings" and note 15, "commitments and contingent liabilities" in item 8 of this form 10-k for a description of certain of these lawsuits.
as discussed in item 3 and note 15, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg, including asbestos-related claims, will not have a material effect on ppg's consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized.
as also discussed in note 15, ppg has significant reserves for environmental contingencies. refer to the environmental matters section of note 15 for details of these reserves. it is ppg's policy to accrue expenses for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted. in management's opinion, the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company's environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg's financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. management anticipates that the resolution of the company's environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time.

the $599 million decrease in cash from operating activities - continuing operations was primarily due to a larger increase in working capital in 2022 compared to the prior year, which reflects the impact of higher raw material costs on inventories and higher selling prices on trade receivables.
operating working capital operating working capital is a subset of total working capital and represents (1) receivables from customers, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, (2) inventories, and (3) trade liabilities. refer to note 3, "working capital detail" in item 8 of this form 10-k for further information related to the components of the company's operating working capital. we believe operating working capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses.

the company's commercial paper borrowings are classified as long-term debt based on ppg's intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis. net payments on commercial paper were $440 million for the year ended december 31, 2022. net proceeds from commercial paper were $190 million for the year ended december 31, 2021.
credit agreements and lines of credit in february 2021, ppg entered into a $2.0 billion term loan credit agreement (the "term loan credit agreement"). the term loan credit agreement provided the company with the ability to borrow up to an aggregate principal amount $2.0 billion on an unsecured basis prior to december 31, 2021 as further discussed in note 10, "borrowings and lines of credit" in item 8 of this form 10-k. in june 2021, ppg borrowed $700 million under the $2.0 billion term loan credit agreement. in december 2021, ppg borrowed an additional $700 million under the term loan credit agreement. in 2022, ppg repaid $300 million of the term loan credit agreement using cash on hand.
in august 2019, ppg amended and restated its five-year credit agreement (the "credit agreement") with several banks and financial institutions as further discussed in note 10, "borrowings and lines of credit" in item 8 of this form 10-k. the credit agreement amends and restates the company's existing five year credit agreement dated as of december 18, 2015. the credit agreement provides for a $2.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. the credit agreement will terminate on august 30, 2024. there were no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement as of december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021.
the term loan credit agreement and credit agreement require the company to maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization, as defined in the term loan credit agreement and credit agreement, of 60% or less; provided, that for any fiscal quarter in which the company has made an acquisition for consideration in excess of $1 billion and for the next five fiscal quarters thereafter, the ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization may not exceed 65% at any time. as of december 31, 2022, total indebtedness to total capitalization as defined under the credit agreement and the term loan was 49%.
in addition to the amounts available under lines of credit, the company maintains access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity.
refer to note 10, "borrowings and lines of credit" in item 8 of this form 10-k for information regarding notes entered into and repaid as well as details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, letters of credit and debt covenants.
2022 ppg annual report and form 10-k 26
cash requirements we continue to believe that our cash on hand and short-term investments, cash from operations and the company's access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital spending, acquisitions, dividend payments, debt service, share repurchases, contributions to pension plans, and ppg's significant cash requirements. the company's significant cash requirements include the following contractual obligations and commitments.
unconditional purchase commitments(3)             $262                   $100                    $106                        $43                        $13
(3)the unconditional purchase commitments are principally take-or-pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials, including industrial gases and electricity, consistent with customary industry practice.
the company's off-balance sheet arrangements include unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the "liquidity and capital resources" section in the cash requirements table as well as letters of credit as discussed in note 10, "borrowings and lines of credit" in item 8 of this form 10-k.
other liquidity matters at december 31, 2022, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits, was $162 million. the timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities. ppg does not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year. the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to if, or when, any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur.
critical accounting estimates management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented in item 8 of this form 10-k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. we believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and to accounting for pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies.
contingencies contingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss. the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to environmental remediation, to pending, impending or overtly threatened litigation against the company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years. for more information on these matters, see note 15, "commitments and contingent liabilities" and note 13, "income taxes" in item 8 of this form 10-k.
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works. to accomplish this, we make extensive use of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates. the company has established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually. refer to note 14, "employee benefit plans" in item 8 of this form 10-k for information on these plans and the assumptions used.
business combinations the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities impacts the determination of future operating results. in addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts, the company uses a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable
2022 ppg annual report and form 10-k 27
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment; third-party actuaries for the estimated obligations of defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations; and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal, environmental and other contingent liabilities.
the business and technical judgment of management was used in determining which acquired intangible assets have indefinite lives and in determining the useful lives of acquired finite-lived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets.
goodwill and intangible assets the company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test at least annually, or more frequently if an indication of impairment arises. the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount. in the quantitative test, fair values are estimated using a discounted cash flow model. key assumptions and estimates used in the discounted cash flow model include discount rates, tax rates, future revenues, operating cash flows and capital expenditures. for more information on these matters, see note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies" in item 8 of this form 10-k.
we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k related to these contingencies, pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates.
currency comparing spot exchange rates at december 31, 2022 and at december 31, 2021, the u.s. dollar strengthened against the currencies of many countries within the regions where ppg operates, most notably the chinese yuan, the euro, and the british pound. as a result, consolidated net assets at december 31, 2022 decreased by $266 million from december 31, 2021.
comparing average exchange rates during 2022 to those of 2021, the u.s. dollar strengthened against the currencies of many countries within the regions ppg operates, including most of the countries in the emea region. this had an unfavorable impact of approximately $86 million on full year 2022 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into u.s. dollars.
forward-looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. management's discussion and analysis and other sections of this annual report contain forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views with respect to future events and financial performance. you can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts. forward-looking statements are identified by the use of the words "aim," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "project," "outlook," "forecast" and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. you are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the sec. also, note the following cautionary statements.
many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's forward-looking statements. such factors include statements related to the expected effects on our business of covid-19, global economic conditions, geopolitical issues in europe, increasing price and product competition by our competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, energy, labor and logistics, the ability to achieve selling price increases, the ability to recover margins, customer inventory levels, ppg inventory levels, our ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, the timing of and the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives, the ability to identify additional cost savings opportunities, the timing and expected benefits of our acquisitions, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, the amount of future share repurchases, economic and political conditions in the markets we serve, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions, the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including asbestos litigation, and government investigations. however, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
consequently, while the list of factors presented here and in item 1a is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements.

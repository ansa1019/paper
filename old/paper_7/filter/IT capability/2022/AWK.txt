operational excellence the company's adjusted regulated o&m efficiency ratio was 33.7% for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to 34.1% for the year ended december 31, 2021. the ratio reflects an increase in operating revenues for the regulated businesses, after considering the adjustment for the amortization of the excess accumulated deferred income taxes ("eadit") shown in the table below, as well as the continued focus on operating costs.
the company's adjusted regulated o&m efficiency ratio is a non-gaap measure and is defined by the company as its operation and maintenance expenses from the regulated businesses, divided by the operating revenues from the regulated businesses, where both operation and maintenance expenses and operating revenues were adjusted to eliminate purchased water expense. operating revenues were further adjusted to exclude reductions for the amortization of the eadit. also excluded from operation and maintenance expenses is the allocable portion of non-o&m support services costs, mainly depreciation and general taxes, which is reflected in the regulated businesses segment as operation and maintenance expenses, but for consolidated financial reporting purposes, is categorized within other line items in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. the items discussed above were excluded from the o&m efficiency ratio calculation as they are not reflective of management's ability to increase the efficiency of the regulated businesses.
the company evaluates its operating performance using this ratio, and believes it is useful to investors because it directly measures improvement in the operating performance and efficiency of the regulated businesses. this information is derived from the company's consolidated financial information but is not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap. this information supplements and should be read in conjunction with the company's gaap disclosures, and should be considered as an addition to, and not a substitute for, any gaap measure. the company's adjusted regulated o&m efficiency ratio (i) is not an accounting measure that is based on gaap; (ii) is not based on a standard, objective industry definition or method of calculation; (iii) may not be comparable to other companies' operating measures; and (iv) should not be used in place of the gaap information provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
table of contents presented in the table below is the calculation of the company's adjusted regulated o&m efficiency ratio and a reconciliation that compares operation and maintenance expenses and operating revenues, each as determined in accordance with gaap, to those amounts utilized in the calculation of its adjusted o&m efficiency ratio:

liquidity and capital resources the company uses its capital resources, including cash, primarily to (i) fund operating and capital requirements, (ii) pay interest and meet debt maturities, (iii) pay dividends, (iv) fund acquisitions, (v) fund pension and postretirement benefit obligations, and (vi) to pay federal income taxes. the company invests a significant amount of cash on regulated capital projects where it expects to earn a long-term return on investment. additionally, the company operates in rate regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited, and where such recovery generally takes place over an extended period of time, and certain capital recovery is also subject to regulatory lag. see item 1-business-regulated businesses-regulation and rate making for additional information. the company expects to fund future maturities of long-term debt through a combination of external debt and, to the extent available, cash flows from operations. since the company expects its capital investments over the next few years to be greater than its cash flows from operating activities, the company currently plans to fund the excess of its capital investments over its cash flows from operating activities for the next five years through a combination of long-term debt and equity in addition to the remaining proceeds from the sale of hos. the remaining proceeds from the sale of hos include receipt of a seller promissory note, plus interest, and a contingent cash payment payable upon satisfaction of certain conditions on or before december 31, 2023. if necessary, the company may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity. in this event, the company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and fund its minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time.
the company regularly evaluates and monitors its cash requirements for capital investments, acquisitions, operations, commitments, debt maturities, interest and dividends. the company's business is capital intensive, with a majority of this capital funded by cash flows from operations. the company also obtains funds from external sources, primarily in the debt markets and through short-term commercial paper borrowings, and may also access the equity capital markets as needed or desired to support capital funding requirements. in order to meet short-term liquidity needs, american water capital corp. ("awcc"), the wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company, issues commercial paper that is supported by its revolving credit facility. the company's access to external financing on reasonable terms may depend on, as appropriate, any or all of the following: current business conditions, including that of the utility and water utility industry in general; conditions in the debt or equity capital markets; the company's credit ratings; and conditions in the national and international economic and geopolitical arenas. disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments. market disruptions may also limit the company's ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets.
table of contents if these unfavorable business, market, financial and other conditions deteriorate to the extent that the company is no longer able to access the commercial paper and/or capital markets on reasonable terms, awcc has access to an unsecured revolving credit facility. awcc's revolving credit facility is used principally to support its commercial paper program, to provide additional liquidity support, and to provide a sublimit for the issuance of up to $150 million in letters of credit. on october 26, 2022, awcc and certain lenders amended and restated the credit agreement with respect to the revolving credit facility to, among other things, increase the maximum commitments under the facility from $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion and to extend the expiration date of the facility from march 2025 to october 2027. subject to satisfying certain conditions, the credit agreement also permits awcc to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to an aggregate of $500 million and to request extensions of its expiration date for up to two one-year periods. also, effective october 26, 2022, the maximum aggregate principal amount of short-term borrowings authorized under awcc's commercial paper program was increased from $2.10 billion to $2.60 billion. as of december 31, 2022, awcc had no outstanding borrowings and $78 million of outstanding letters of credit under its revolving credit facility, with $1.50 billion available to fulfill its short-term liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit.
the company believes that its ability to access the debt and equity capital markets, the revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash to fund the company's short-term requirements. the company believes it has sufficient liquidity and the ability to manage its expenditures, should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets. however, there can be no assurance that the lenders will be able to meet existing commitments to awcc under the revolving credit facility, or that awcc will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on acceptable terms or at all.
cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and, due to the seasonality of demand, are generally greater during the warmer months. the company's future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by, among other things: customers' ability to pay for service in a timely manner, economic utility regulation, inflation, compliance with environmental, health and safety standards, production costs, maintenance costs, customer growth, declining customer usage of water, employee-related costs, including pension funding, weather and seasonality, taxes, and overall economic conditions.
operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in the company's rate regulated environments, changes in the economy, interest rates, the timing of tax payments, and the company's customers' ability to pay for service in a timely manner, among other items. the company can provide no assurance that its customers' historical payment pattern will continue in the future. the company's current liabilities may exceed current assets mainly from debt maturities due within one year and the use of short-term debt as a funding source, primarily to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, fund acquisitions and construction projects, as well as cash needs, which can fluctuate significantly due to the seasonality of the business and other factors. the company addresses cash timing differences primarily through its short-term liquidity funding mechanisms.
presented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the company's cash flows from operating activities:

(b)changes in working capital include changes to receivables and unbilled revenues, income tax receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, accrued taxes and other current assets and liabilities, net.
(c)the decrease in the 2022 deferred tax activity is primarily due to the settlement of the deferred tax liability related to new york american water, sold in january 2022.
table of contents in 2022, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $333 million. the changes were driven by $338 million of estimated tax payments primarily for taxable gains on the sales of the company's hos business and its new york regulated operations, as well as the contribution of $45 million to the american water charitable foundation. partially offsetting these changes was a decrease due to the gain recognized from the sale of hos in 2021.
the company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of $39 million in 2023. actual amounts contributed could change materially from this estimate as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns, among other factors.

in 2022, cash flows used in investing activities increased $591 million primarily due to increased payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions partially offset by proceeds of $608 million received from the sale of the company's new york operations. the company continues to invest across all infrastructure categories, mainly replacement and renewal of transmission and distribution and services, meter and fire hydrants infrastructure in the company's regulated businesses, as discussed below.
the company's infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs, where the company replaces mains, services, meters, hydrants and valves, as needed, and major capital investment projects, where the company constructs new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth and water quality regulations. the company's projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors.
presented in the table below is a summary of the company's capital expenditures by category:

in 2022, the company's capital expenditures increased $533 million due to an increase across most infrastructure categories.
the company also grows its business primarily through acquisitions of water and wastewater systems. these acquisitions are generally located in geographic proximity to the company's existing regulated businesses and support continued geographical diversification and growth of its operations. generally, acquisitions are funded initially with short-term debt, and later refinanced with long-term financing. during 2022, the company paid $315 million for the acquisition of 26 water and wastewater systems, representing in the aggregate approximately 70,000 customers.
as previously noted, over the next five years the company expects to invest between $14 billion to $15 billion, with $12.5 billion to $13 billion for infrastructure improvements in the regulated businesses, and the company expects to invest between $30 billion to $34 billion over the next 10 years. in 2023, the company expects to invest $2.9 billion, consisting of $2.5 billion for infrastructure improvements and $400 million for acquisitions in the regulated businesses.
table of contents cash flows from financing activities presented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the company's cash flows from financing activities:
for the years ended december 31,
net short-term borrowings (repayments) with maturities less than three months             591                           (198)                             (5)
other financing activities, net (a)                                                        69                              35                              22
net cash provided by (used in) financing activities                                    $1,000                          $(345)                          $1,120
(a)includes proceeds from issuances of common stock under various employee stock plans and the company's dividend reinvestment plan, net of taxes paid, advances and contributions in aid of construction, net of refunds, and debt issuance costs and make-whole premiums on early debt redemption.
in 2022, cash flows provided by financing activities increased $1,345 million, primarily due to an increase in commercial paper borrowings, the repayment in full at maturity of the $500 million term loan in 2021 and repayments of long-term debt due to the prepayment of $327 million in aggregate principal amount of awcc's outstanding senior notes in 2021, with no comparable repayments in 2022. these changes were partially offset by lower proceeds from long-term debt.
the company's financing activities are primarily focused on funding regulated infrastructure expenditures, regulated acquisitions and payment of dividends. these activities included the issuance of long-term and short-term debt, primarily through awcc. based on the needs of the regulated businesses and the company, awcc may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets and then, through intercompany loans, provide those borrowings to the regulated businesses and parent company. the regulated businesses and parent company are obligated to pay their portion of the respective principal and interest to awcc, in the amount necessary to enable awcc to meet its debt service obligations. parent company's borrowings are not a source of capital for the regulated businesses, therefore, parent company is not able to recover the interest charges on its debt through regulated water and wastewater rates. as of december 31, 2022, awcc has made long-term fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to the regulated businesses amounting to $7.6 billion. additionally, as of december 31, 2022, awcc has made long-term fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to parent company amounting to $3.6 billion.
on may 5, 2022, awcc issued $800 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.45% senior notes due 2032. at closing, awcc received, after deduction of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of approximately $792 million. awcc used the net proceeds of the offering: (i) to lend funds to parent company and its regulated subsidiaries; (ii) to repay awcc's commercial paper obligations; and (iii) for general corporate purposes.
one of the principal market risks to which the company is exposed is changes in interest rates. in order to manage the exposure, the company follows risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as treasury lock agreements. the company also reduces exposure to interest rates by managing commercial paper and debt maturities. the company does not enter into derivative contracts (through awcc) for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. the derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. the company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. the company minimizes the counterparty credit risk on these transactions by dealing only with leading, creditworthy financial institutions, having long-term credit ratings of "a" or better.
in april 2022, the company entered into several 10-year treasury lock agreements, with notional amounts totaling $400 million, and an average fixed interest rate of 2.89%. the company designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss. in may 2022, the company terminated the treasury lock agreements, realizing a net gain of approximately $4 million, to be amortized through interest, net over a 10-year period, in accordance with the tenor of the debt issuance on may 5, 2022.
table of contents in november and december 2022, the company entered into four 10-year treasury lock agreements, with notional amounts totaling $100 million, to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2023. these treasury lock agreements terminate in january 2024, and have an average fixed rate of 3.56%. in january 2023, the company entered into three additional 10-year treasury lock agreements, with notional amounts totaling $100 million, to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2023. these treasury lock agreements terminate in january 2024, and have an average fixed rate of 3.35%. the company designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss. upon termination, the cumulative gain or loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss will be amortized through interest, net over the term of the new debt.
no ineffectiveness was recognized on hedging instruments for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020.
in february 2021, parent company and awcc filed with the sec a universal shelf registration statement that enables the company to meet its capital needs through the offer and sale to the public from time to time of an unlimited amount of various types of securities, including american water common stock, preferred stock, and other equity and hybrid securities, and awcc debt securities, all subject to market conditions and demand, general economic conditions, and as applicable, rating status. the shelf registration statement will expire in february 2024. during 2022, 2021 and 2020, $800 million, $1.10 billion, and $1.00 billion, respectively, of debt securities were issued under this and predecessor registration statements.

from time to time and as market conditions warrant, the company may engage in long-term debt retirements through make-whole redemptions, tender offers, open market repurchases or other viable alternatives.
table of contents issuer and guarantor of senior notes the outstanding senior notes issued by awcc have been issued under two indentures, each by and between awcc and computershare trust company, n.a., as successor to wells fargo bank, national association, as trustee, providing for the rights and obligations of the parties thereto and the holders of the notes issued thereunder. the senior notes also have been issued with the benefit of a support agreement, as amended, between parent company and awcc, which serves as the functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of awcc's payment obligations under the senior notes. no other subsidiary of parent company provides guarantees for any of the outstanding senior notes. if awcc is unable to make timely payment of any interest, principal or premium, if any, on such senior notes, parent company will provide to awcc, at its request or the request of any holder of such senior notes, funds to make such payment in full. if awcc fails or refuses to take timely action to enforce certain rights under the support agreement or if awcc defaults in the timely payment of any amounts owed to any holder of such senior notes, when due, the support agreement provides that the holder may proceed directly against parent company to enforce such rights or to obtain payment of the defaulted amounts owed to that holder.
as a wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company, awcc has no significant assets other than obligations of parent company and certain of its subsidiaries in its regulated businesses segment to repay certain intercompany loans made to them by awcc. awcc's ability to make payments of amounts owed to holders of the senior notes will be dependent upon awcc's receipt of sufficient payments of amounts owed pursuant to the terms of such intercompany loans and from its ability to issue indebtedness or otherwise obtain loans in the future, the proceeds of which would be used to fund the repayment of the senior notes.
because parent company is a holding company and substantially all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiaries other than awcc, parent company's ability to fulfill its obligations under the support agreement will be dependent upon its receipt of sufficient cash dividends or distributions from its operating subsidiaries. see note 9-shareholders' equity-dividends and distributions, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the limitations on parent company and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions. furthermore, parent company's operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, other than awcc, have no obligation to make any payments on the senior notes or to make available or provide any funds for such payment, other than through their repayment obligations under intercompany loans, if any, with awcc. based on the foregoing, parent company's obligations under the support agreement will be effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, lease commitments and moneys borrowed or other indebtedness incurred or issued by parent company's subsidiaries other than awcc.
credit facilities and short-term debt interest rates on advances under the company's revolving credit facility are based on a credit spread to the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") rate (or applicable market replacement rate) or base rate, each determined in accordance with moody investors service's and s&p global ratings' then applicable credit rating on awcc's senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt. the facility is used principally to support awcc's commercial paper program and to provide up to $150 million in letters of credit. indebtedness under the facility and awcc's commercial paper are considered "debt" for purposes of a support agreement between parent company and awcc, which serves as a functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of awcc's payment obligations thereunder.
presented in the tables below are the aggregate credit facility commitments, commercial paper limit and letter of credit availability under the revolving credit facility, as well as the available capacity for each, as of december 31:

presented in the table below is the company's total available liquidity as of december 31, 2022 and 2021:
cash and cash equivalents       availability on revolving credit facility        total available liquidity
available liquidity as of december 31, 2022                        $85                                     $1,495                                $1,580
available liquidity as of december 31, 2021                        116                                      1,590                                 1,706
the weighted average interest rate on awcc's outstanding short-term borrowings was approximately 4.41% and 0.20%, for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
capital structure presented in the table below is the percentage of the company's capitalization represented by the components of its capital structure as of december 31:
total common shareholders' equity                                          38.3   %           39.9   %           37.1   %
long-term debt and redeemable preferred stock at redemption value          54.4   %           56.6   %           53.6   %
the changes in the capital structure mix between periods were mainly attributable to the impacts of the hos sale on december 9, 2021, and the repayment of short-term borrowings with proceeds from the sale, and the company's long-term debt offering that was completed on may 5, 2022.
debt covenants the company's debt agreements contain financial and non-financial covenants. to the extent that the company is not in compliance with these covenants, an event of default may occur under one or more debt agreements and the company, or its subsidiaries, may be restricted in its ability to pay dividends, issue new debt or access the revolving credit facility. the long-term debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things, prohibit or restrict the company from issuing debt secured by the company's assets, subject to certain exceptions. failure to comply with any of these covenants could accelerate repayment obligations.
covenants in certain long-term notes and the revolving credit facility require the company to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization (as defined in the relevant documents) of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. on december 31, 2022, the company's ratio was 0.62 to 1.00 and therefore the company was in compliance with the covenants.
table of contents security ratings presented in the table below are long-term and short-term credit ratings and rating outlooks as of february 15, 2023, as issued by moody's investors service on december 19, 2022, and s&p global ratings on february 6, 2023:
securities                    moody's investors service        s&amp;p global ratings rating outlook                stable                           stable senior unsecured debt         baa1                             a commercial paper              p-2                              a-1
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. security ratings are highly dependent upon the ability to generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to service debt and meet investment plans. the company can provide no assurances that its ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintain its existing ratings. none of the company's borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings, although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under its credit facility.
as part of its normal course of business, the company routinely enters into contracts for the purchase and sale of water, power and other fuel, chemicals and other services. these contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit the company and its counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. in accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if the company is downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include a demand that the company must provide collateral to secure its obligations. the company does not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and respective financing costs in those markets, may be directly affected by the company's securities ratings. the company primarily accesses the debt capital markets, including the commercial paper market, through awcc. however, the company has also issued debt through its regulated subsidiaries, primarily in the form of mortgage bonds and tax exempt securities or borrowings under state revolving funds, to lower the overall cost of debt.
dividends and regulatory restrictions for discussion of the company's dividends, dividend restrictions and dividend policy, see note 9-shareholders' equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
insurance coverage the company carries various property, casualty, cyber and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles and exclusions that it believes are consistent with industry standards. however, insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims. additionally, annual policy renewals can be impacted by claims experience which in turn can impact coverage terms and conditions on a going-forward basis. the company is self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. such losses could have a material adverse effect on the company's short-term and long-term financial condition and its results of operations and cash flows.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates, assumptions and judgments that could affect the company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. actual results could differ from these estimates, assumptions and judgments. management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. accordingly, changes in the estimates, assumptions and judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on the company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as reflected in the company's consolidated financial statements. management has reviewed the critical accounting polices described below with the company's audit, finance and risk committee, including the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in their application. additional discussion regarding these critical accounting policies and their application can be found in note 2-significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
table of contents regulation and regulatory accounting the company's regulated utilities are subject to regulation by pucs and, as such, the company follows the authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, which requires the company to reflect the effects of rate regulation in its consolidated financial statements. use of this authoritative guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria: (i) third-party regulation of rates; (ii) cost-based rates; and (iii) a reasonable assumption that rates will be set to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investment, or rate base. as of december 31, 2022, the company concluded that the operations of its utilities met the criteria.
application of this authoritative guidance has a further effect on the company's financial statements as it pertains to allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. the company makes significant assumptions and estimates to quantify amounts recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities. such judgments include, but are not limited to, assets and liabilities related to regulated acquisitions, pension and postretirement benefits, depreciation rates and taxes. due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenues, these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a non-regulated entity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. conversely, the principles require the creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers.
for each regulatory jurisdiction where the company conducts business, the company assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future settlement. this assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in regulatory environments, recent rate orders (including recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction) and the status of any pending or potential legislation. if subsequent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or probable future settlement, the company's consolidated statements of operations and financial position could be materially affected. in addition, if the company concludes in a future period that a separable portion of the business no longer meets the criteria, the company is required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business, which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in the consolidated financial statements. failure to meet the criteria of this authoritative guidance could materially impact the company's consolidated financial statements.
as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, the company's regulatory asset balance was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, and its regulatory liability balance was $1.6 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. see note 3-regulatory matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company's significant regulatory assets and liabilities.
accounting for income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances and the utilization of nol carryforwards.
in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the company accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach, including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. if it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements.
the company evaluates the probability of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and its intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. the company also assesses its ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. the company records valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when it concludes that it is more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.
under gaap, specifically asc 740, income taxes, the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. asc 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled. for the company's regulated entities, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or a regulatory liability and may be subject to refund to customers. for the company's unregulated operations, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as a non-cash re-measurement adjustment to earnings.
table of contents actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, the company's forecasted financial condition and results of operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies and recovery of taxes through the regulatory process for the regulated businesses, as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. the resulting tax balances as of december 31, 2022 and 2021 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance; however, the ultimate outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material. see note 14-income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes.
accounting for pension and postretirement benefits the company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared service operations. the company also maintains other postretirement benefit plans providing medical and life insurance to eligible retirees. see note 2-significant accounting policies and note 15-employee benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the description of and accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans.
the company's pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. material changes in the company's pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets. the assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy. these differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the company recognizes. the primary assumptions are:
•discount rate-the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future. the objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.
•expected return on plan assets ("eroa")-management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance, but primarily based upon the plans' mix of assets and expectations for the long-term returns on those asset classes. these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs the company records currently.
•rate of compensation increase-management projects employees' pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement.
•health care cost trend rate-management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care.
•mortality- management adopted the society of actuaries pri-2012 mortality base table, the most recent table developed from private pension plan experience, which provides rates of mortality in 2012 and adopted the new mp-2021 mortality improvement scale to gradually adjust future mortality rates downward due to increased longevity in each year after 2012.
the discount rate assumption, which is determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently, is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bond indices. the company uses an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans' expected cash flows by matching the plans' cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. for each plan, the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments. the weighted-average discount rate assumption for determining pension benefit obligations was 5.58%, 2.94% and 2.74% at december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. the weighted-average discount rate assumption for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 5.60%, 2.90% and 2.56% at december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
in selecting an eroa, the company considered tax implications, past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans. the weighted-average eroa assumption used in calculating pension cost was 6.50% for 2022, 6.50% for 2021, and 6.50% for 2020. the weighted-average eroa assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 3.60% for 2022, 3.67% for 2021 and 3.68% for 2020.

(a)refer to note 15-employee benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details on the allocations of assets and the trusts which fund the other postretirement benefit plans the investments of the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts include debt and equity securities held either directly or through mutual funds, commingled funds and limited partnerships. the trustee for the company's defined benefit pension and postretirement welfare plans uses an independent valuation firm to calculate the fair value of plan assets.
in selecting a rate of compensation increase, the company considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. the company's rate of compensation increase was 3.51% for 2022, 3.51% for 2021 and 3.51% for 2020.
in selecting health care cost trend rates, the company considers past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs. as of january 1, 2022, the company's health care cost trend rate assumption used to calculate the periodic benefit cost was 6.00% in 2022 gradually declining to 5.00% in 2026 and thereafter. as of december 31, 2022, the company projects that medical inflation will be 7.00% in 2023 gradually declining to 5.00% in 2031 and thereafter.
the company will use a weighted-average discount rate and eroa of 5.58% and 6.75%, respectively, for estimating its 2023 pension costs. additionally, the company will use a weighted-average discount rate and eroa of 5.60% and 5.00%, respectively, for estimating its 2023 other postretirement benefit costs. a decrease in the discount rate or the eroa would increase the company's pension expense. the company's 2022 pension and postretirement total net benefit credit was $47 million and the 2021 pension and postretirement total net benefit credit was $41 million. the company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of $39 million in 2023; however, the actual amounts contributed could change materially from this estimate. the assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim re-measurement of the plan obligations. the impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur, or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards.
benefit plan amendments in december 2022, the company amended the american water pension plan ("awpp"), a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, to restructure it as of december 31, 2022. the restructuring involved the spin-off of certain inactive participants from the existing awpp into a separate tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, the american water pension plan for certain inactive participants ("awpp inactive"). benefits offered to the plan participants remain unchanged. actuarial gains and losses associated with awpp inactive will be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants, which increases the amortization period from approximately 7 years to 18 years. the longer amortization period is expected to lower the company's pre-tax pension expense by approximately $5 million in 2023. the actuarial gains and losses associated with the awpp will continue to be amortized over the average remaining service period for active participants. the company remeasured the pension plan obligation and assets for each plan as of december 31, 2022.
table of contents upon evaluating prior plan changes, company funding and market performance, in december 2022, the company completed plan amendments to spin-off and merge a portion of the american water retiree welfare plan, with and into the company's medical plan for active employees ("active medical plan"), in order to repurpose the over-funded portion of the bargained retiree voluntary employees' beneficiary association ("bargained veba") trust. benefits offered to the plan participants remain unchanged. as a result of these changes, effective december 31, 2022, the company transferred investment assets from the bargained veba into the existing trust maintained for the benefit of active medical plan participants ("active veba"). the transfer of these bargained veba investment assets into the active veba permits access to approximately $194 million of assets for purposes of paying active union employee medical benefits. the company recorded the transfer of assets as a negative contribution and therefore did not record a gain or loss, as permitted by accounting guidance. see note 18-fair value of financial information in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information on accounting for the assets as investments in debt and equity securities as of december 31, 2022.
revenue recognition revenue from the company's regulated businesses is generated primarily from water and wastewater services delivered to customers. these contracts contain a single performance obligation, the delivery of water or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promises within the contracts and, therefore, is not distinct. revenues are recognized over time, as services are provided. there are generally no significant financing components or variable consideration. revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis, and unbilled amounts calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. the amounts that the company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer's actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer.
increases or decreases in the volumes delivered to customers and rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue. in addition, changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenue calculation. unbilled revenue for the company's regulated utilities as of december 31, 2022 and 2021 was $178 million and $162 million, respectively.
the company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking process.
revenue from the company's former hos business, which was sold in december 2021, was generated through various protection programs in which the company provided fixed fee services to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial customers for interior and exterior water and sewer lines, interior electric and gas lines, heating and cooling systems, water heaters, power surge protection and other related services. most of the contracts had a one-year term and each service was a separate performance obligation, satisfied over time, as the customers simultaneously received and consumed the benefits provided from the service. customers were obligated to pay for the protection programs ratably over 12 months or via a one-time, annual fee, with revenues recognized ratably over time for those services. advances from customers were deferred until the performance obligation was satisfied.
the company also has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the u.s. government on various military installations and facilities owned by municipal customers. billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably over the term of the contract, as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the company. additionally, these contracts allow the company to make capital improvements to underlying infrastructure, which are initiated through separate modifications or amendments to the original contract, whereby stand-alone, fixed pricing is separately stated for each improvement. the company has determined that these capital improvements are separate performance obligations, with revenue recognized over time based on performance completed at the end of each reporting period. losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the losses first become probable and estimable. revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenues, with billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met. changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined. unbilled revenue within other as of december 31, 2022 and 2021 was $97 million and $86 million, respectively.
table of contents accounting for contingencies the company records loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss or a range of losses can be reasonably estimated. the determination of a loss contingency is based on management's judgment and estimates about the likely outcome of the matter, which may include an analysis of different scenarios. liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change. in assessing whether a loss is reasonably possible, management considers many factors, which include, but are not limited to: the nature of the litigation, claim or assessment, review of applicable law, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors, and the experience gained from similar cases or situations. the company provides disclosures for material contingencies when management deems there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred. the company provides estimates of reasonably possible losses when such estimates may be reasonably determined, either as a single amount or within a reasonable range.
actual amounts realized upon settlement or other resolution of loss contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded on the consolidated financial statements. see note 16-commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding contingencies.

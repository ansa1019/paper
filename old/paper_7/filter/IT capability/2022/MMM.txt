item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is designed to provide a reader of 3m's financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. 3m's md&a is presented in eight sections:
•critical accounting estimates
•financial condition and liquidity
•financial instruments forward-looking statements in item 7 may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the section entitled "cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results" in item 1 and the risk factors provided in item 1a for discussion of these risks and uncertainties).
additional information about results of operations and financial condition for 2021 and 2020 can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" sections in 3m's current report on form 8-k dated april 26, 2022 (which updated 3m's 2021 annual report on form 10-k).
•changes in measure of segment operating performance used by 3m's chief operating decision maker-impacting 3m's disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income). see additional information in note 19. 3m's disclosed disaggregated revenue was also updated as a result of the changes in segment reporting. see additional information in note 2.
•changes to non-gaap measures - certain amounts adjusted for special items. refer to the certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-gaap measures) section below for additional information.
3m manages its operations in four operating business segments: safety and industrial; transportation and electronics; health care; and consumer. from a geographic perspective, any references to emea refer to europe, middle east and africa on a combined basis. references are made to organic sales change (which include both organic volume impacts and selling price impacts), which is defined as the change in net sales, absent the separate impacts on sales from foreign currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures. acquisition and divestiture sales change impacts, if any, are measured separately for the first twelve months post-transaction. 3m believes this information is useful to investors and management in understanding ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.
3m is impacted by the global pandemic and related effects associated with the coronavirus (covid-19). risk factors with respect to covid-19 can be found in item 1a "risk factors" in this document. given the diversity of 3m's businesses, some of the factors relative to covid-19 increase the demand for 3m products, while others decrease demand or make it more difficult for 3m to serve customers. certain resulting impacts are referenced in various discussions within this item 7. overall, the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on 3m's consolidated results of operations was primarily driven by factors related to changes in demand for products and disruption in global supply chains. 3m is not able to predict the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
in 2022, 3m's costs for significant litigation (see certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-gaap measures section below) totaled approximately $2.3 billion pre-tax and included, among things, pre-tax charges associated with steps toward resolving combat arms earplugs litigation and associated with additional commitments to address pfas-related matters at its zwijndrecht, belgium site (approximately $1.3 billion and $355 million, respectively, in 2022). these matters are further discussed in note 16. in 2022, 3m also completed the split-off of its food safety division business resulting in a pre-tax gain of $2.7 billion and committed to a plan to exit pfas manufacturing by the end of 2025 resulting in a 2022 pre-tax charge of $0.8 billion related to impairment as discussed in note 15. see certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-gaap measures) section below for additional discussion of these and other special items.
3m belgium has experienced interruptions to portions of the manufacturing at its site in zwijndrecht, belgium, as more fully discussed in note 16. as discussed in note 16, 3m belgium received agreement with authorities in june 2022 to begin the process toward restarting operations at the zwijndrecht facility. 3m belgium has provided information required by the flemish environmental authorities to receive agreement from the authorities to restart operations, and has done so for production or sampling purposes. belgian government authorities continue to maintain oversight of these operations and compliance with applicable requirements. in december 2022, 3m belgium received an official infraction report from the flemish environmental inspectorate and continues to work with the government authorities to comply with applicable legal requirements. see further discussion in note 16.
3m is also impacted by the russia-ukraine conflict. in light of a number of factors, 3m suspended operations of its subsidiaries in russia in march 2022, the net sales of which were less than one percent of 3m's consolidated net sales for 2021. further, in september 2022, management committed to a plan to exit and dispose of the related net assets through an intended sale of the subsidiaries. the associated charge in 2022 related to this action is further discussed in note 15. 3m also has other operations that source certain raw materials from suppliers in russia and have experienced related supply disruption due to the conflict. further supply disruption could lead to downstream customer impacts.
though 3m monitors relevant factors as well as options to mitigate potential impacts, it is not able to predict the extent to which these circumstances may have a material effect on 3m's consolidated results of operations or financial condition. relevant risk factors can be found in item 1a "risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k.

table of contents organic growth/productivity and other:
•remaining organic growth/productivity and other impacts resulted in a net year-on-year benefit $0.85 to earnings per share and 1.3 percent to operating margins which was impacted by the following:
◦benefits from strong pricing, spending discipline and 2021 restructuring actions
◦manufacturing headwinds from global supply chain challenges; geopolitical impacts due to the russia/ukraine conflict as well as ongoing covid-related challenges in china
◦second quarter of 2021 benefit of $91 million pre-tax ($0.12 per share after tax) from the impact of the favorable decision of the brazilian supreme court regarding the calculation of past social taxes
◦increased investments in growth, productivity and sustainability
•in 2021, organic volume growth and ongoing cost management increased operating income margins and earnings per diluted share year-on-year offset by manufacturing headwinds from global supply chain challenges and increased compensation/benefit costs. the following also impacted results or provide additional information:
•2021 benefit of $91 million pre-tax ($0.12 per share after tax) from a favorable brazilian supreme court decision that concluded on the impact of state value-added tax when determining brazil's federal sales-based social tax-essentially lowering the social tax that 3m should have paid in prior periods.
•3m continued prioritization of investments in growth and sustainability.
•2021 benefit from higher selling prices, restructuring actions taken in 2020 and positive/negative impact of year-over-year change in non-divestiture-related restructuring charges, net of adjustments, for respective periods. note 5 provides additional information relative to restructuring actions.
•in 2021, higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost increased expense year-on-year.
•in 2022, 3m continued to experience inflationary pressures with year-on-year increases in raw material and logistics costs driven by many geopolitical, logistics, and disruptive events that caused imbalance in the global supply chain.
acquisitions/divestitures:
•divestiture impacts in 2022 include lost income from divested businesses and remaining stranded costs (net of transition arrangement income). 3m completed the split-off of the food safety business in september 2022 (discussed in note 3). the impact also includes lost income from deconsolidation of the aearo entities in july 2022 (discussed in note 16).
•divestiture impacts in 2021 are primarily comprised of the lost income from the divestiture of the company's drug delivery business (sale completed in may 2020).
•foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased operating income by approximately $271 million and $103 million (or a decrease in pre-tax earnings of approximately $280 million and $119 million) year-on-year for 2022 and 2021, respectively. these estimates include: (a) the effects of year-on-year changes in exchange rates on translating current period functional currency profits into u.s. dollars and on current period non-functional currency denominated purchases or transfers of goods between 3m operations, and (b) year-on-year changes in transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.
•interest expense (net of interest income) decreased in 2022 compared to the same period year-on-year driven by debt maturities in the ordinary course and interest income on invested cash.
•certain items above reflect specific income tax rates associated therewith. overall, the effective tax rates for 2022, 2021, and 2020 were 9.6 percent, 17.8 percent, and 19.7 percent, respectively. these reflect a decrease of 8.2 percentage points from 2021 to 2022 and a decrease of 1.9 percentage points from 2020 to 2021. the primary factors that decreased the company's effective tax rate for 2022 were the tax efficient structure associated with the gain on split-off of the food safety business (see note 3). the primary factors that decreased the company's effective tax rate in 2021 were geographical income mix and favorable adjustments in 2021 related to impacts of u.s. international tax provisions.

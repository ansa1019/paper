item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. it should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10-k, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in forward-looking statements and item 1a, risk factors.
overview of business and strategy our core business is making and selling chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks, with additional businesses in adjacent, locally relevant categories including gum & candy, cheese & grocery and powdered beverages around the world.
we aim to be the global leader in snacking. our strategy is to drive long-term growth by focusing on four strategic priorities: accelerating consumer-centric growth, driving operational excellence, creating a winning growth culture and scaling sustainable snacking. we believe the successful implementation of our strategic priorities and leveraging of our attractive global footprint, strong core of iconic global and local brands, marketing, sales, distribution and cost excellence capabilities, and top talent with a growth mindset, will drive consistent top- and bottom-line growth, enabling us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders.
for more detailed information on our business and strategy, refer to item 1, business.
recent developments and significant items affecting comparability macroeconomic environment we continue to observe significant market uncertainty, increasing inflationary pressures, supply constraints, exchange rate volatility as well as ongoing effects from the covid-19 pandemic. throughout the pandemic, we experienced an overall increase in demand and revenue growth as consumers increased their food purchases for in-home consumption in some markets, while parts of our business were negatively affected by related lockdowns and restrictions. additionally, global supply chain, transportation and labor issues escalated and we experienced significantly higher operating costs, including higher overall raw material, transportation, labor and energy costs that have continued to rise.
our overall outlook for future snacks revenue growth remains strong; however, we anticipate ongoing volatility in response to covid-related risks and supply chain issues, including labor and transportation constraints. we will continue to proactively manage our business in response to the evolving global economic environment and related uncertainty and business risks while also prioritizing and supporting our employees and customers. we continue to take steps to mitigate impacts to our supply chain, operations, technology and assets.
war in ukraine in february 2022, russia began a military invasion of ukraine. for the safety of our employees, we stopped production and closed our facilities in ukraine; since then we have been gradually restoring operations, continuing to take steps to protect the safety of our employees and partially re-opening our two plants. we are providing all of our employees with compensation and with help in securing shelter in neighboring countries, where required and needed. we have also made cash and in-kind donations to several humanitarian aid organizations in the region.
in march 2022, our two ukrainian manufacturing facilities in trostyanets and vyshhorod were significantly damaged.
during the remainder of 2022, the war continued through parts of ukraine. we continue to make targeted repairs on both our plants. we relaunched our systems and implemented additional safety and security measures. in late june, we partially reopened the vyshhorod plant and restarted limited potato chip production and in late november, we reopened the trostyanets plant and restarted limited chocolate production. see note 1, summary of significant accounting policies - war in ukraine, to the condensed consolidated financial statements, and refer to items affecting comparability of financial results for additional information.
as a food company, we continue to work to support the continuity of food supply and provide packaged foods to consumers. we have suspended new capital investments and our advertising spending in russia, but as a food company with more than 2,500 employees in the country, we have not ceased operations given we believe we play a role in the continuity of the food supply. we are complying and will comply with applicable international sanctions table of contents and other measures that have been or may be imposed on russian entities. we continue to evaluate the situation in ukraine and russia and our ability to control our operating activities and businesses on an ongoing basis, and we continue to consolidate both our ukrainian and russian subsidiaries. prior to the onset of the war, ukraine generated 0.5% and russia generated 2.9% of 2021 consolidated net revenues and in 2022, ukraine generated 0.3% and russia generated 4.0% of consolidated net revenue. our russian business has grown as a result of the recent strengthening of the russian ruble versus the u.s. dollar, underlying trends of consumers toward snack and packaged food categories and increased price. the combination of pricing, volume growth, suspension of advertising and ruble strength has resulted in a significant increase in the profitability of the russian business and contributed to the growth of our consolidated performance. our decision to suspend new capital investments in russia has not had a material impact on our ability to meet demand within our russian business during 2022. we believe the war in ukraine has had a negative impact on our business throughout the rest of our europe operating segment, but the impact of this is difficult to quantify. we cannot predict if the recent strength in our russian business will continue in the future.
we provide more information on risks related to the war in ukraine in our financial outlook and commodity trends section, item 3, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, and under item 1a, risk factors.
acquisitions and divestitures during 2022, we completed the following acquisitions to strategically complement and expand our existing portfolio:
•ricolino, a confectionery business with products sold primarily in mexico
•clif bar & company ("clif bar"), a leading u.s. maker of nutritious energy bars with organic ingredients
•chipita global s.a. ("chipita"), a high-growth leader in the central and eastern european croissant and baked snacks category additionally in 2022, we announced our intention to divest our developed market gum and global halls candy businesses and in q4 2022, we announced an agreement to sell the developed market gum business with an anticipated closing of q4 2023, subject to relevant antitrust approvals and closing conditions.
refer to note 2, acquisitions and divestitures, and liquidity and capital resources for additional details.
equity method investment transactions jde peet's transactions in 2022, we sold approximately 18.6 million of our shares back to jde peet's, which reduced our ownership interest by approximately 3% to 19.8%. we recorded a loss of €8 million ($8 million). in 2021, we issued €300 million exchangeable bonds. if all bonds were redeemed in exchange for shares, this would represent approximately 8.5 million shares or approximately 9% of our equity interest in jde peet's. in 2020, we exchanged our 26.4% ownership interest in jde for a 26.5% equity interest in jde peet's, which was then taken public. during the initial public offering, we sold approximately 11.1 million shares, recording a pre-tax gain of $131 million and a $250 million tax expense and reducing our ownership interest to 22.9%.
for additional information, refer to note 7, equity method investments and note 10, financial instruments.
see note 1, summary of significant accounting policies - currency translation and highly inflationary accounting for additional details.
table of contents u.k. advertising and promotion ban in the united kingdom, a ban on specific types of tv and online advertising of food containing levels of fat, sugar or salt above specified thresholds is expected to go into effect in october 2025, and new measures restricting certain promotions are expected to go into effect in october 2023. restrictions on in-store placement of some of those products went into effect in october 2022. although we are unable to estimate precisely the impact of the restrictions, they did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements in 2022.
taxes we continue to monitor existing and potential future tax reform around the world. on august 16, 2022, the u.s. enacted the inflation reduction act of 2022, which, among other things, implements a 15% minimum tax on book income of certain large corporations, a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases and several tax incentives to promote clean energy. based on our initial analysis of the provisions, we expect to meet the criteria of a large corporation but we do not believe this legislation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. we will continue to evaluate it as additional guidance and clarification becomes available. we also continue to monitor countries' progress toward enactment of the organization of economic cooperation and development's model rules on a global minimum tax. during december 2022, the european union reached agreement on the introduction of a minimum tax directive requiring each member state to enact local legislation. additionally, south korea became the first country to enact minimum tax rules, which will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after january 1, 2024. these specific actions did not impact our consolidated financial statements in 2022 but future enacted legislation in this area could have a material effect on us, if enacted.
-net revenues increased in 2022, driven by higher net pricing, incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of chipita, clif bar and ricolino in 2022 and gourmet foods and grenade in 2021 and favorable volume/mix, partially offset by a significant impact from unfavorable currency translation, as the u.s. dollar strengthened relative to most currencies we operate in compared to exchange rates in the prior year and the impact of divestitures.
-net revenues increased in 2021, driven by favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, a significant impact from favorable currency translation, as most currencies we operate in strengthened against the u.s. dollar compared to exchange rates in the prior year, and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of gourmet foods, grenade and hu in 2021 and give & go in 2020.
•organic net revenue increased 12.3% to $32.2 billion in 2022 and increased 5.1% to $27.9 billion in 2021. organic net revenue increased in both 2022 and 2021 due to higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. organic net revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from acquisitions and divestitures. we use organic net revenue as it provides improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying operating results (see the definition of organic net revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within non-gaap financial measures appearing later in this section).
-diluted eps decreased in 2022 driven by lapping prior-year net gains on equity method transactions, unfavorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, the impact from the european commission legal matter, higher acquisition-related costs, incremental costs incurred due to the war in ukraine, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, higher intangible asset impairment charges, lower net earnings from divestitures, higher remeasurement loss of net monetary position and inventory step-up charges incurred in 2022, partially offset by an increase in adjusted eps, lower simplify to grow program costs, lower negative impacts from enacted tax law changes, lower equity method investee items, 2017 malware incident net recoveries and lower negative impact from pension participation changes.
-diluted eps increased in 2021 driven by an increase in adjusted eps, lapping prior-year costs associated with the jde peet's transaction, favorable year-over-year mark-to-market impacts from currency and commodity derivatives, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lapping the prior-
table of contents year loss on interest rate swaps, lower losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses, lower simplify to grow program costs and a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. these factors were partially offset by a lower gain on equity method investment transactions, higher initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, lower net earnings from divestitures, lapping the prior-year benefit from the resolution of tax matters and higher impact from pension participation changes.
-adjusted eps increased in 2022, driven by operating gains and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, higher interest expense and lower equity method investment earnings.
-adjusted eps increased in 2021, driven by operating gains, favorable currency translation, fewer shares outstanding, higher equity method investment earnings and lower interest expense, partially offset by higher taxes primarily due to a lower net benefit from non-recurring discrete tax items.
adjusted eps and adjusted eps on a constant currency basis are non-gaap financial measures. we use these measures as they provide improved year-over-year comparability of our underlying results (see the definition of adjusted eps and our reconciliation with diluted eps within non-gaap financial measures appearing later in this section).
financial outlook we seek to achieve profitable, long-term growth and manage our business to attain this goal using our key operating metrics: organic net revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted eps. we use these non-gaap financial metrics and related computations, particularly growth in profit dollars, to evaluate and manage our business and to plan and make near- and long-term operating and strategic decisions. as such, we believe these metrics are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap") financial results. we believe it is useful to provide investors with the same financial information that we use internally to make comparisons of our historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and evaluate our business. we believe our non-gaap financial measures should always be considered in relation to our gaap results. we have provided reconciliations between our gaap and non-gaap financial measures in non-gaap financial measures, which appears later in this section.
in addition to monitoring our key operating metrics, we monitor a number of developments and trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives:
demand - we monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products. core snacks categories continued to expand due to the continued growth of snacking as a consumer behavior around the world. as part of our strategic plan, we seek to drive category growth by leveraging our local and consumer-focused commercial approach, making investments in our brand and snacks portfolio, building strong routes to market in both emerging and developed markets and improving our availability across multiple channels. we believe these actions will help drive demand in our categories and strengthen our positions across markets.
long-term demographics and consumer trends - snack food consumption is highly correlated to gdp growth, urbanization of populations and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class, particularly in emerging markets. we believe that snacks continue to be a source of comfort as well as excitement and variety for consumers. social media increasingly helps consumers find food trends, inspiration and connection on their social media and other feeds. consumers are also interested in buying snacks conveniently, whether through same-day delivery apps, shipped sources or different retail settings. many consumers also continue to prioritize sustainability in their purchase decisions, valuing sustainably sourced ingredients, low carbon footprint preparation and lower waste packaging. we seek to continue to offer snacks that meet consumer needs and preferences and align with our strategic priorities.
pricing - our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions, such as increasing input and operating costs due to supply, transportation and labor constraints and higher cost trends. we adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including market factors, transportation, logistics and changes in our product input costs, and we have increased prices to control costs given recent significant cost inflation.
table of contents operating costs - our operating costs include raw materials, labor, selling, general and administrative expenses, taxes, currency impacts and financing costs. we manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives, sourcing and hedging programs, pricing actions, refinancing and tax planning. to remain competitive on our operating structure, we continue to work on programs to expand our profitability, such as our simplify to grow program, which is designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. we experienced significantly higher operating costs, including higher overall raw material, transportation, labor and fuel costs that have continued to rise.

net revenue increase of 9.7% was driven by our underlying organic net revenue growth of 12.3% and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation and the impact of divestitures. overall, we continued to see increased demand for our snack category products. organic net revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. higher net pricing in all regions was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2021 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2022. favorable volume/mix was driven by amea, latin america and north america, primarily due to strong volume gains across our snack category products, while volume/mix was essentially flat in europe. the november 1, 2022 acquisition of ricolino added incremental net revenues of $98 million (constant currency basis), the august 1, 2022 acquisition of clif bar added incremental net revenues of $361 million, the january 3, 2022 acquisition of chipita added incremental net revenues of $720 million (constant currency basis), the april 1, 2021 acquisition of gourmet food added incremental net revenues of $15 million (constant currency basis) and the march 25, 2021 acquisition of grenade added incremental net revenues of $22 million (constant currency basis). unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $1,905 million, primarily due to the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to most currencies, including the euro, british pound sterling, argentinean peso, turkish lira, australian dollar, indian rupee, polish zloty, chinese yuan and swedish krona, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, primarily the russian ruble, brazilian real and mexican peso. the impact of divestitures resulted in a year-over-year reduction in net revenues of $56 million. refer to note 2, acquisitions and divestitures, for more information.

during 2022, we realized higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix, which was largely offset by increased input costs. higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2021 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2022, was reflected in all regions. overall, volume/mix benefited from strong volume growth due to continued increased demand for our snack category products. favorable volume/mix was driven by amea and latin america, which was slightly offset by unfavorable volume/mix in north america and europe. the increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs as well as higher manufacturing costs. higher raw material costs were in part due to higher dairy, packaging, edible oils, energy, grains, sugar, nuts and other ingredients costs as well as unfavorable year-over-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower cocoa costs.
total selling, general and administrative expenses increased $1,121 million from 2021, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, the impact from the european commission legal matter, the impact of acquisitions, higher acquisition-related costs, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, higher remeasurement loss of net monetary position, higher divestiture-related costs, incremental costs due to the war in ukraine and lapping the prior-year favorable impact from the resolution of a tax matter, which were partially offset by a favorable currency impact related to expenses, lapping the prior-year unfavorable impact from pension participation changes, incremental expenses associated with the 2017 malware incident net recoveries and lower implementation costs incurred for the simplify to grow program. excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $474 million from 2021. the increase was driven primarily by higher overheads, in part due to increased investments in route-to-market capabilities, and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs.
unfavorable currency changes decreased operating income by $319 million primarily due to the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to most currencies, including the euro, british pound sterling, turkish lira, australian dollar, indian rupee, polish zloty, egyptian pound and chinese yuan, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, including the russian ruble and brazilian real.
operating income margin decreased from 16.2% in 2021 to 11.2% in 2022. the decrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by the year-over-year unfavorable change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and commodity hedging activities, the impact from the european commission legal matter, higher acquisition-related costs, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, lower adjusted operating income margin, incremental costs due to the war in ukraine, higher intangible asset impairment charges, higher remeasurement of net monetary position and inventory step-up charges incurred in 2022, partially offset by lower costs for the simplify to grow program, lapping the prior-year unfavorable impact from pension participation changes, lower divestiture-related costs and the impact of 2017 malware incident net recoveries. adjusted operating income margin decreased from 16.6% in 2021 to 16.0% in 2022. the decrease was driven primarily by higher raw material costs, unfavorable product mix and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by higher net pricing and overhead cost leverage.

net revenue increase of 8.0% was driven by our underlying organic net revenue growth of 5.1%, favorable currency, the impact of acquisitions and the partial year contributions of businesses divested in 2022 and a business divested on november 1, 2021 which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition. overall, we continued to see increased demand for our snack category products, though parts of our business were not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. in developed markets, increased food purchases for in-home consumption continued to drive net revenue growth, partially offset by declines in some markets as they lapped strong volume growth in 2020 resulting from increased consumer demand due to the pandemic. in emerging markets, we lapped the negative initial impacts we experienced from the pandemic in 2020, with strong revenue growth in 2021 across most of our key markets, though some markets remained challenged. in addition, sales of our gum and candy products grew as out-of-home consumption continued to recover, as did our world travel business as global travel improved, though still below pre-pandemic levels. favorable currency translation and incremental net revenues from acquisitions also added to revenue growth in 2021.
organic net revenue growth was driven by favorable volume/mix and higher net pricing. favorable volume/mix in europe, amea and latin america was primarily driven by strong volume gains as we lapped the significant negative impacts of the pandemic in many of our key markets. this was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in north america as the region lapped very strong prior-year volume growth from significant food purchases for in-home consumption due to the pandemic. higher net pricing in all regions was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2020 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2021. favorable currency impacts increased net revenues by $472 million, primarily due to the strength of several currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, including the euro, british pound sterling, chinese yuan, australian dollar, canadian dollar, south african rand and mexican peso, partially offset by the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to several currencies, including the argentinean peso, brazilian real and turkish lira. the april 1, 2021 acquisition of gourmet food added incremental net revenues of $47 million (constant currency basis), the march 25, 2021 acquisition of grenade added table of contents incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis), the january 4, 2021 acquisition of hu added incremental net revenues of $38 million and the april 1, 2020 acquisition of give & go added incremental net revenues of $106 million in 2021. the packaged seafood business, which was part of our april 1, 2021 acquisition of gourmet food but divested on november 1, 2021, added incremental net revenues of $35 million prior to its divestiture. in addition, businesses divested in 2022 and 2021 added incremental revenues of $46 million in 2021. refer to note 2, acquisitions and divestitures, for more information.

during 2021, we realized higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix, which was largely offset by increased input costs. higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2020 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2021, was reflected in all regions. favorable volume/mix was driven by europe, amea and latin america, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in north america. overall, volume/mix benefited from volume gains as we lapped the significant negative impacts of the pandemic in many of our key markets, while in north america, we lapped high volume growth in 2020 from significant food purchases for in-home consumption due to the pandemic. the increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and lower year-over-year incremental covid-19 related costs. higher raw material costs were in part due to higher foreign currency transaction costs on imported materials, as well as increased costs for edible oils, packaging, sugar, cocoa, grains, dairy and other ingredients.
total selling, general and administrative expenses increased $165 million from 2020, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, an unfavorable currency impact related to expenses, incremental expenses from acquisitions, the impact from pension participation changes, lower benefits from the resolution of tax matters and higher acquisition-related costs, which were partially offset by lower implementation costs incurred for the simplify to grow program, lapping prior-year costs associated with the jde peet's transaction and a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $134 million from 2020. the increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, partially offset by lower overhead spending including lower year-over-year incremental covid-19 related costs.
favorable currency changes increased operating income by $120 million, primarily due to the strength of several currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, including the british pound sterling, euro, chinese yuan. australian dollar and canadian dollar, partially offset by the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to several currencies, including the argentinean peso, brazilian real and turkish lira.
operating income margin increased from 14.5% in 2020 to 16.2% in 2021. the increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by the favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and commodity hedging activities, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lower simplify to grow program costs, a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments and lapping prior-year costs associated with the jde peet's transaction, partially offset by the impact from pension participation changes, higher divestiture-related costs and higher acquisition-related costs. adjusted operating income margin for 2021 was flat to 2020 at 16.6%. adjusted operating income margin was unchanged as higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs due to productivity and lower year-over-year incremental covid-19 costs, and lower selling, general and administrative costs were offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable product mix and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs.

net revenues increased $949 million (9.3%), due to favorable currency (3.7 pp), favorable volume/mix (3.6 pp), higher net pricing (1.4 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (0.6 pp). favorable currency impacts reflected the strength of most currencies in the region relative to the u.s. dollar, including the euro, british pound sterling, norwegian krone, swedish krona and czech koruna, partially offset by the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to a few currencies, including the turkish lira and russian ruble. favorable volume/mix was driven by strong volume growth as we experienced increased demand for most of our snack category products and our world travel business continued to recover as global travel improved though still remained below pre-pandemic levels. favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in chocolate, biscuits & baked snacks, cheese & grocery, and refreshment beverages, partially offset by declines in gum and candy. higher net pricing was reflected across all categories except cheese & grocery. the march 25, 2021 acquisition of grenade added incremental net revenues of $63 million (constant currency basis) in 2021.
segment operating income increased $317 million (17.9%), primarily due to favorable volume/mix, higher net pricing, lower simplify to grow program costs, lower manufacturing costs (productivity and lower incremental covid-19 related costs), favorable currency, lapping prior-year intangible asset impairment charges, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of an acquisition. these favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, the impact from pension participation changes and acquisition integration costs incurred in 2021.
2022 compared with 2021:
net revenues increased $1,378 million (16.6%), due to higher net pricing (11.5 pp), the impact of acquisitions (4.7 pp) and favorable volume/mix (0.8 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (0.4 pp). higher net pricing was reflected across all categories driven by pricing actions taken during 2022. the august 1, 2022 acquisition of clif bar added incremental net revenues of $361 million and the january 3, 2022 acquisition of chipita added incremental net revenues of $35 million in 2022. favorable volume/mix was driven by gains in candy, chocolate and gum, partially offset by a decline in biscuits & baked snacks which primarily reflected the impact of supply chain constraints on volume during the year. unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to the canadian dollar.
segment operating income increased $398 million (29.0%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower costs incurred for the simplify to grow program, lapping a prior-year intangible asset impairment charge and the impact of acquisitions. these favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material costs, higher manufacturing costs, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments (including lapping a prior year benefit from contingent consideration adjustments), higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, fixed asset impairment charges incurred in 2022, inventory step-up charges incurred in 2022, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses, unfavorable volume/mix and unfavorable currency.
2021 compared with 2020:
net revenues increased $145 million (1.8%), due to the impact of acquisitions (1.8 pp), higher net pricing (1.0 pp) and favorable currency (0.6 pp), partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix (1.6 pp). the april 1, 2020 acquisition of give & go added incremental net revenues of $106 million and the january 4, 2021 acquisition of hu added incremental net revenues of $38 million in 2021. higher net pricing was driven by biscuits & baked snacks, gum and candy, partially offset by lower net pricing in chocolate. favorable currency impact was due to the strength of the canadian dollar relative to the u.s. dollar. unfavorable volume mix reflected volume declines as the region lapped prior-year strong volume growth driven by significantly increased food purchases for in-home consumption due to the pandemic as well as impacts from labor disruptions and supply chain constraints in the second half of 2021. unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in biscuits & baked snacks, candy, chocolate and gum.
segment operating income decreased $216 million (13.6%), primarily due to unfavorable volume/mix, higher raw material costs, higher simplify to grow program costs and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs. these unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including lower covid-19 related costs), a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, lower intangible asset impairment charges, lower manufacturing costs (lower incremental covid-19 related costs and productivity) and favorable currency.
table of contents critical accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. we have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee. the following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates.
goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets:
we test goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on july 1. we assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units. we review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur. annually, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may elect to do quantitative testing instead. in our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit's estimated fair value with its carrying value. we estimate a reporting unit's fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. this year, for our europe and north america reporting units, we used a market-based, weighted-average cost of capital of 6.8% to discount the projected cash flows of those operations. for our latin america and amea reporting units, we used a risk-rated discount rate of 9.8%. estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions based on available information. given the uncertainty of the global economic environment, those estimates could be significantly different than future performance. if the carrying value of a reporting unit's net assets exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value.
in 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no impairments of goodwill. in connection with our 2022 annual impairment testing, each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value. while all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.
annually, we assess indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these assets. if significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset, we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value. we utilize estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand's global fair value. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value.
in 2022, we recorded $101 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to two biscuit brands in amea. the impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs. we use several accepted valuation methods, including relief from royalty, excess earnings and excess margin, that utilize estimates of future sales, earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand's global fair value. we also identified eight brands with $1.5 billion of aggregate book value as of december 31, 2022 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. we believe our current plans for each of these brands reduce the risk of impairment in future periods, but if the brand earnings expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change significantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. in 2021, we recorded a $32 million of intangible asset impairment charge related to one biscuit brand in north america. in 2020, we recorded $144 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to gum, chocolate, biscuits and candy brands, with $83 million in north america, $53 million in europe, $5 million in amea and $3 million in latin america.
refer to note 6, goodwill and intangible assets, for additional information.
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the acquisition or consolidation of a business are recorded at fair value, with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. we engage third-party valuation specialists to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. in determining fair value, we utilized various forms of the income approach, depending on the asset being valued. such valuations require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. management makes estimates of fair value based upon the best information available at the date of acquisition. these estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain. critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include, but are not limited to: expected future cash flows of the acquired business, discount and royalty rates and economic lives of customer relationships, trade names and fixed assets. unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or estimates.
further, certain of our acquisitions may include earn-out provisions or other forms of contingent consideration. as of the acquisition date, we record contingent consideration, as applicable, at the estimated fair value of expected future payments associated with the earn-out. any changes to the recorded fair value of contingent consideration will be recognized as expenses or earnings in the period in which they occur. such contingent consideration liabilities are based on best estimates of future expected payment obligations, which are subject to change due to many factors outside of our control. changes to the estimate of expected future contingent consideration payments may occur, from time to time, due to various reasons, including changing discount rates as well as actual results differing from estimates and adjustments to the revenue or earnings assumptions used as the basis for the liability based on historical experience.
we promote our products with trade and sales incentives as well as marketing and advertising programs. these programs include, but are not limited to, new product introduction fees, discounts, coupons, rebates and volume-based incentives as well as cooperative advertising, in-store displays and consumer marketing promotions. trade and sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period. we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates. for interim reporting purposes, advertising and consumer promotion expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume, based on estimated sales volume and estimated program spending. we do not defer costs on our year-end consolidated balance sheets and all marketing and advertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred.
employee benefit plans:
we sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout the world. these include primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits. for accounting purposes, we estimate the pension and postretirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates; expected returns on plan assets; expected compensation increases; employee-related factors such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; and health care cost trends. we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans.
as permitted by u.s. gaap, we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods. the cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.
since pension and postretirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses. for plans that have assets held in trust, the expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses. the assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in note 11, benefit plans, to the consolidated financial statements.
table of contents while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2022 assumptions for our u.s. and non-u.s. pension and postretirement health care plans, as a sensitivity measure, a fifty-basis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects, increase/(decrease), on our annual benefit plan costs:
postretirement health care costs see additional information on our employee benefit plans in note 11, benefit plans.
as a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. the provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions. our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings across tax jurisdictions, changes in tax laws and regulations, tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax positions. we recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution. we evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the amount recognized in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations. we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. however, final determination of historical tax liabilities, whether by settlement with tax authorities, judicial or administrative ruling or due to expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and historical income tax provisions. the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes, net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made.
see note 16, income taxes, for additional information on our effective tax rate, current and deferred taxes, valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits.
see note 14, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we believe that cash from operations, our revolving credit facilities, short-term borrowings and our authorized long-term financing will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and future payments of our contractual, tax and benefit plan obligations and payments for acquisitions, share repurchases and quarterly dividends. we expect to continue to utilize our commercial paper program and international credit lines as needed. we continually evaluate long-term debt issuances to meet our short- and longer-term funding requirements. we also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. our investments in jde peet's and kdp also provide us additional flexibility. overall, we do not expect negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity, and we continue to monitor our operations in europe and related effects from the war in ukraine. to date, we have been successful in generating cash and raising financing as needed. however, if a serious economic or credit market crisis ensues or other adverse developments arise, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.
our most significant ongoing short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations (including expenditures for raw materials, labor, manufacturing and distribution, trade and promotions, advertising and marketing, tax liabilities, benefit plan obligations and lease expenses) as well as periodic expenditures for acquisitions, shareholder returns (such as dividend payments and share repurchases), property, plant and equipment and any significant one-time non-operating items.
long-term cash requirements primarily relate to funding long-term debt repayments (refer to note 9, debt and borrowing arrangements), our u.s. tax reform transition tax liability and deferred taxes (refer to note 16, income taxes), our long-term benefit plan obligations (refer to note 11, benefit plans) and commodity-related purchase commitments and derivative contracts (refer to note 10, financial instruments).
we generally fund short- and long-term cash requirements with cash from operating activities as well as cash proceeds from short- and long-term debt financing (refer to debt below). we generally do not use equity to fund our ongoing obligations.
for a full discussion related to the financial condition for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2020, including a year-to-year comparison between 2021 and 2020, see part ii, item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2021.
we believe our ability to generate substantial cash from operating activities and readily access capital markets and secure financing at competitive rates are key strengths and give us significant flexibility to meet our short and long-term financial commitments. our cash flow activity over the last three years is noted below:
net cash provided by operating activities                   $3,908           $4,141                 $3,964
net cash (used in)/provided by investing activities         $(4,888)         $(26)                    $500
net cash used in financing activities                       $(456)           $(4,069)             $(2,215)
net cash provided by operating activities:
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2022 was primarily due to increased year-over-year working capital requirements, as the increase in accounts receivable and inventories was offset by increases in other liabilities. this is largely a result of business growth and acquisitions during the year.
net cash used in/provided by investing activities:
the increase in net cash used in investing activities was largely driven by higher cash payments for acquisitions, including $1.4 billion cash consideration paid for the chipita acquisition during january 2022, $2.6 billion cash consideration paid for the clif bar acquisition during august 2022 and $1.3 billion cash consideration paid for the ricolino acquisition in november 2022 relative to $833 million paid in the prior-year to acquire gourmet food, grenade and hu (refer to note 2, acquisitions and divestitures), as well as lower proceeds from sales of equity method investments than in the prior-year period (refer to note 7, equity method investments), partially offset by proceeds from the settlement and replacement of net investment hedge derivative contracts.
table of contents capital expenditures were $906 million in 2022, $965 million in 2021 and $863 million in 2020. we continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives. we expect 2023 capital expenditures to be up to $1.2 billion, including capital expenditures in connection with our simplify to grow program and for funding our strategic priorities. we expect to continue to fund these expenditures with cash from operations.
net cash used in financing activities:
the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower net debt repayments with higher proceeds from borrowings in 2022 as we refinanced debt during the first quarter of 2022 with lower interest rate debt and we lapped higher net long-term debt repayments in the prior-year.
we paid dividends of $1,985 million in 2022, $1,826 million in 2021 and $1,678 million in 2020. on july 26, 2022, the audit committee, with authorization delegated from our board of directors, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.385 per share of class a common stock, an increase of 10 percent, which would be $1.54 per common share on an annualized basis. the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.
for u.s. income tax purposes only, the company has determined that 100% of the distributions paid to its shareholders in 2022 are characterized as a qualified dividend paid from u.s. earnings and profits. see note 13, capital stock, to the consolidated financial statements and item 5, market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities - issuer purchases of equity securities, for information on our share repurchase program.
supply chain financing as part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our suppliers over the past several years to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers are from 30 to 180 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. we also facilitate voluntary supply chain financing ("scf") programs through several participating financial institutions. under these programs, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine invoices that they want to sell to participating financial institutions. our suppliers' voluntary inclusion of invoices in scf programs has no bearing on our payment terms or amounts due. our responsibility is limited to making payments based upon the agreed-upon contractual terms. no guarantees are provided by the company or any of our subsidiaries under the scf programs and we have no economic interest in the suppliers' decision to participate in the scf programs. amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the scf program are included in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets. we have confirmed with participating financial institutions that as of december 31, 2022, and december 31, 2021, $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable to suppliers that participate in the scf programs are outstanding.
as discussed in note 14, commitments and contingencies, we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. as part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. at december 31, 2022, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity.
the nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. due to seasonality, in the first and second quarters of the year, our working capital requirements grow, increasing the need for short-term financing. the second half of the year typically generates higher cash flows. as such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet short-term working capital or other financing needs.
table of contents refer to note 9, debt and borrowing arrangements, for a projection of long-term debt scheduled to mature (including current maturities and finance leases) in future periods. in the next 12 months, we expect to repay approximately $0.3 billion of maturing long-term debt. we fund ongoing debt maturities and other long-term obligations using cash on hand or we may refinance obligations with long-term debt or short-term financing (such as our commercial paper borrowings) depending on financing available, timing considerations, flexibility to raise funding and the cost of financing.
at its july 2022 meeting, the board of directors approved a new $2 billion long-term financing authorization that replaced the prior long-term financing authorization of $7 billion. as of december 31, 2022, $1.5 billion of the long-term financing authorization remained available.
our total debt was $22.9 billion at december 31, 2022 and $19.5 billion at december 31, 2021. our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.46 at december 31, 2022 and 0.41 at december 31, 2021. the weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 8.2 years at december 31, 2022 and 9.5 years at december 31, 2021. our average daily commercial borrowings were $1.6 billion in 2022, $0.5 billion in 2021 and $2.3 billion in 2020. we had commercial paper borrowings of $2.2 billion at december 31, 2022 and $0.2 billion at december 31, 2021. we expect to continue to use cash or commercial paper to finance various short-term financing needs. as of december 31, 2022, we continued to be in compliance with our debt covenants.
commodity trends we regularly monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. during 2022, the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher dairy, packaging, edible oils, energy, grains, sugar, nuts and other ingredient costs as well as unfavorable year-over-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower cocoa costs.
a number of external factors such as the current macroeconomic environment, including global inflation, effects of the war in ukraine, climate and weather conditions, commodity, transportation and labor market conditions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. we address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, such as dairy, where there is a limited ability to hedge, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. due to competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors, our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily.
as a result of international supply chain, transportation and labor market disruptions and generally higher commodity, transportation and labor costs, we expect price volatility and a higher aggregate cost environment to continue. while the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available.
table of contents non-gaap financial measures we use non-gaap financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. we use non-gaap financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. we have detailed the non-gaap adjustments that we make in our non-gaap definitions below. the adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition and divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. we believe the non-gaap measures should always be considered along with the related u.s. gaap financial measures. we have provided the reconciliations between the gaap and non-gaap financial measures below, and we also discuss our underlying gaap results throughout our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form 10-k.
our primary non-gaap financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year operating results. as new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. when our definitions change, we provide the updated definitions and present the related non-gaap historical results on a comparable basis (1).
•"organic net revenue" is defined as net revenues excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures (2) and currency rate fluctuations (3). we also evaluate organic net revenue growth from emerging markets and developed markets.
•our emerging markets include our latin america region in its entirety; the amea region, excluding australia, new zealand and japan; and the following countries from the europe region: russia, ukraine, türkiye, kazakhstan, georgia, poland, czech republic, slovak republic, hungary, bulgaria, romania, the baltics and the east adriatic countries.
•our developed markets include the entire north america region, the europe region excluding the countries included in the emerging markets definition, and australia, new zealand and japan from the amea region.
•"adjusted operating income" is defined as operating income excluding the impacts of the simplify to grow program (4); gains or losses (including non-cash impairment charges) on goodwill and intangible assets; divestiture (2) or acquisition gains or losses, divestiture-related costs (5), acquisition-related costs (6), and acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments (7); inventory step-up charges (8); the operating results of divestitures (2); remeasurement of net monetary position (9); mark-to-market impacts from commodity, forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivative contracts (10); impact from resolution of tax matters (11); 2017 malware incident net recoveries; incremental costs due to the war in ukraine (12); impact from the european commission legal matter (13); impact from pension participation changes (14); and costs associated with the jde peet's transaction. we also present "adjusted operating income margin," which is subject to the same adjustments as adjusted operating income. we also evaluate growth in our adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis (3).
•"adjusted eps" is defined as diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international from continuing operations excluding the impacts of the items listed in the adjusted operating income definition as well as losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses; gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans, net earnings from divestitures (2); initial impacts from enacted tax law changes (15); and gains or losses on equity method investment transactions. similarly, within adjusted eps, our equity method investment net earnings exclude our proportionate share of our investees' significant operating and non-operating items (16). we also evaluate growth in our adjusted eps on a constant currency basis (3).
(1)    when items no longer impact our current or future presentation of non-gaap operating results, we remove these items from our non-gaap definitions. in the first quarter of 2022, we added to the non-gaap definitions the exclusion of incremental costs due to the war in ukraine (refer to footnote (12) below), in the second quarter of 2022, we added to the non-gaap definitions the exclusion of costs incurred associated with our publicly-announced processes to sell businesses (refer to footnote (5) below) and in the third quarter of 2022, we added to the non-gaap definitions the exclusion of inventory step-up charges associated with acquisitions (refer to footnote (8) below). in the fourth quarter of 2022, we added to the non-gaap definitions the exclusion of the impact from the european commission legal matter (refer to footnote (13) below).
(2)    divestitures include completed sales of businesses (including the partial or full sale of an equity method investment) and exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement. as we record our share of kdp and jde peet's ongoing earnings on a one-quarter lag basis, any kdp or jde peet's ownership reductions are reflected as divestitures within our non-gaap results the following quarter. during the third quarter of 2021, we began to exclude the impact of certain adjustments made table of contents to our acquisition contingent consideration liabilities that were recorded at the date of acquisition. we made this adjustment to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. see note 2, acquisitions and divestitures, and note 7, equity method investments, for information on acquisitions and divestitures impacting the comparability of our results.
(5)    divestiture-related costs, which includes costs incurred in relation to the preparation and completion of our divestitures as defined in footnote (2), also includes costs incurred associated with our publicly-announced processes to sell businesses. we exclude these items to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.
(6)    acquisition-related costs, which includes transaction costs such as third party advisor, investment banking and legal fees, also includes one-time compensation expense related to the buyout of non-vested esop shares and realized gains or losses from hedging activities associated with acquisition funds. we exclude these items to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.
(7)    acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments include one-time costs related to the integration of acquisitions as well as any adjustments made to the fair market value of contingent compensation liabilities that have been previously booked for earn-outs related to acquisitions that do not relate to employee compensation expense. we exclude these items to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.
(8)    in the third quarter of 2022, we began to exclude the one-time inventory step-up charges associated with acquired companies related to the fair market valuation of the acquired inventory. we exclude this item to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.
(9)    in connection with our applying highly inflationary accounting (refer to note 1, summary of significant accounting policies), for argentina (beginning in the third quarter of 2018) and türkiye (beginning in the second quarter of 2022), we exclude the related remeasurement gains or losses related to remeasuring net monetary assets or liabilities denominated in the local currency to the u.s. dollar during the periods presented to be consistent with our prior accounting for these remeasurement gains/losses for venezuela when it was subject to highly inflationary accounting prior to deconsolidation in 2015.
(10)    we exclude unrealized gains and losses (mark-to-market impacts) from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivative from our non-gaap earnings measures. the mark-to-market impacts of commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives are excluded until such time that the related exposures impact our operating results. since we purchase commodity and forecasted currency transaction contracts to mitigate price volatility primarily for inventory requirements in future periods, we make this adjustment to remove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. we exclude equity method investment transaction derivative contract settlements as they represent protection of value for future divestitures.
(11)    see note 14, commitments and contingencies - tax matters, for additional information.
(12)    in february 2022, russia began a military invasion of ukraine and we stopped our production and closed our facilities in ukraine. we began to incur incremental costs directly related to the war including asset impairments, such as property and inventory losses, higher expected allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable and committed compensation. we have isolated and exclude these costs and related impacts from our operating results to facilitate evaluation and comparisons of our ongoing results. incremental costs related to increasing operations in other primarily european facilities are not included with these costs.
(13)    in the fourth quarter of 2022, we began to exclude the impact from the european commission legal matter. in november 2019, the european commission informed us that it initiated an investigation into our alleged infringement of european union competition law through certain practices allegedly restricting cross-border trade within the european economic area. on january 28, 2021, the european commission announced it had taken the next procedural step in its investigation and opened formal proceedings. we have been cooperating with the investigation and are currently engaged in discussions with the european commission in an effort to reach a negotiated, proportionate resolution to this matter. as of december 31. 2022, we recorded an estimate of the possible cost to resolve this matter. due to the unique nature of this matter, we believe it to be infrequent and unusual and therefore exclude it to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. refer to note 14, commitments and contingencies - tax matters, for additional information.
(14)    the impact from pension participation changes represents the charges incurred when employee groups are withdrawn from multiemployer pension plans and other changes in employee group pension plan participation. we exclude these charges from our non-gaap results because those amounts do not reflect our ongoing pension obligations. see note 11, benefit plans, for more information on the multiemployer pension plan withdrawal.
(15)    we have excluded the initial impacts from enacted tax law changes. initial impacts include items such as the remeasurement of deferred tax balances and the transition tax from the 2017 u.s. tax reform. previously, we only excluded the initial impacts from more material tax reforms, specifically the impacts of the 2019 swiss tax reform and 2017 u.s. tax reform. we exclude initial impacts from enacted tax law changes from our adjusted eps as they do not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under the enacted tax law changes. refer to note 16, income taxes, for more information.
(16)    we have excluded our proportionate share of our equity method investees' significant operating and non-operating items such as acquisition and divestiture related costs, restructuring program costs and initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, in order to provide investors with a comparable view of our performance across periods. although we have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with our ownership interests in our equity method investees and review the underlying operating results and significant operating and non-operating items each reporting period, we do not have direct control over their operations or resulting revenue and expenses. our use of equity method investment net earnings on an adjusted basis is not intended to imply that we have any such control. our gaap "diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international from continuing operations" includes all of the investees' significant operating and non-operating items.
we believe that the presentation of these non-gaap financial measures, when considered together with our u.s. gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding u.s. gaap financial measures, provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent table of contents these disclosures. because non-gaap financial measures vary among companies, the non-gaap financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. our use of these non-gaap financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any u.s. gaap financial measures. a limitation of these non-gaap financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our u.s. gaap reported results. the best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our non-gaap financial measures in combination with our u.s. gaap reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile u.s. gaap reported figures to the non-gaap financial measures in this form 10-k.
applying the definition of "organic net revenue", the adjustments made to "net revenues" (the most comparable u.s. gaap financial measure) were to exclude the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures. we believe that organic net revenue reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results. we also evaluate our organic net revenue growth from emerging markets and developed markets, and these underlying measures are also reconciled to u.s. gaap below.

applying the definition of "adjusted operating income", the adjustments made to "operating income" (the most comparable u.s. gaap financial measure) were to exclude the impacts of the simplify to grow program; intangible asset impairment charges; mark-to-market impacts from commodity, forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivative contracts; acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments; inventory step-up charges; acquisition related costs; divestiture-related costs; operating income from divestitures; net gain on an acquisition and divestitures; 2017 malware incident net recoveries; impact from the european commission legal matter; incremental costs due to the war in ukraine; costs associated with jde peet's transaction; the remeasurement of net monetary position; impact from pension participation changes; and impact from resolution of tax matters. we also evaluate adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis. we believe these measures provide improved comparability of underlying operating results.

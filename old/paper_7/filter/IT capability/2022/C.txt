management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary as described further throughout this executive summary, citi demonstrated continued progress across the franchise during 2022:
•citi's revenues increased 5% versus the prior year, including net gains on sales of citi's philippines and thailand consumer banking businesses versus a loss on sale of citi's australia consumer banking business in the prior year. excluding these divestiture-related impacts (see "2022 results summary" below), revenues increased 3%, driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by lower non-interest revenues.
•citi's expenses increased 6% versus the prior year, including divestiture-related impacts in both the current and prior years. excluding these divestiture-related impacts (see "2022 results summary" below), expenses increased 8%, driven by continued investments in citi's transformation, business-led investments and volume-related expenses, as well as other risk and control investments and inflation, all partially offset by productivity savings, the impact of foreign exchange translation and the expense reduction from the closure of five exit markets (see also "expenses" below).
•citi's cost of credit was $5.2 billion, versus $(3.8) billion in the prior year, largely reflecting a net build of $1.2 billion in the allowance for credit losses (acl) for loans and unfunded commitments, primarily due to consumer loan growth and a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions, compared to a net acl release of $8.8 billion in the prior year.
•citi returned $7.3 billion to common shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
•citi's common equity tier 1 (cet1) capital ratio increased to 13.0% as of december 31, 2022, compared to 12.2% as of december 31, 2021 (for additional information, see "capital resources" below). citi's required regulatory cet1 capital ratio was 12.0% as of january 1, 2023, under the basel iii standardized approach.
•citi made substantial progress on its consumer banking business divestitures in 2022, closing sales in five exit markets and working toward closing four additional sale transactions, as well as progressing with the ongoing wind-downs of the korea consumer banking business and russia consumer, local commercial and institutional businesses.
2022 results summary citigroup citigroup reported net income of $14.8 billion, or $7.00 per share, compared to net income of $22.0 billion, or $10.14 per share in the prior year. the decrease in net income was primarily driven by the higher cost of credit, resulting from loan growth in personal banking and wealth management (pbwm) and a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions, and the higher operating expenses, partially offset by the higher revenues. citigroup's effective tax rate was 19.4% in the current year versus 19.8% in the prior year. earnings per share (eps) decreased 31%, reflecting the decrease in net income, partially offset by a 4% decline in average diluted shares outstanding.
as discussed above, results for 2022 included divestiture-related impacts of approximately $(184) million in after-tax earnings, substantially all of which were recorded in legacy franchises (for additional information, see discussion below). collectively, divestiture-related impacts had a $0.09 negative impact on eps. this compares to divestiture-related negative impacts on eps of $0.80 in 2021. (as used throughout this form 10-k, citi's results of operations and financial condition excluding the divestiture-related impacts are non-gaap financial measures. citi believes the presentation of its results of operations and financial condition excluding the divestiture-related impacts described above provides a meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of its broader results and legacy franchises' results for investors, industry analysts and others.)
results for 2022 included pretax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $82 million (approximately $(184) million after-tax), substantially all of which were recorded in legacy franchises, primarily consisting of the following:
•approximately $(64) million incremental australia consumer business loss on sale recorded in revenues
•approximately $535 million goodwill impairment recorded in expenses due to re-segmentation and timing of divestitures
•approximately $161 million of aggregate divestiture-related costs results for 2021 included pretax divestiture-related impacts of $(1.9) billion (approximately $(1.6) billion after-tax) in legacy franchises, which primarily consisted of the following:
•approximately $1.1 billion related to charges incurred from the voluntary early retirement program (verp) in connection with the wind-down of the korea consumer banking business recorded in expenses
•contract modification costs related to the asia divestitures of $119 million citigroup revenues of $75.3 billion increased 5% versus the prior year. excluding the divestiture-related impacts, revenues were up 3%, as the impact of higher interest rates across businesses and strong loan growth in pbwm were partially offset by declines in banking in institutional clients group (icg) and asia investment product revenue in global wealth management (global wealth), as well as the reduction in revenues from the closure of five exit markets and ongoing wind-downs.
citigroup's end-of-period loans were $657 billion, down 2% versus the prior year, largely driven by legacy franchises and the impact of foreign exchange translation. the decline in legacy franchises primarily reflected the reclassification of loans to other assets to reflect held-for-sale (hfs) accounting, as a result of the signing of sale agreements for consumer banking businesses in asia consumer banking (asia consumer), as well as the impact of the ongoing korea and russia wind-downs.
citigroup's end-of-period deposits were $1.4 trillion, up 4% versus the prior year, largely driven by treasury and trade solutions in icg, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation.
expenses citigroup's operating expenses of $51.3 billion increased 6% in 2022. reported expenses included divestiture-related impacts of approximately $696 million in the current year and approximately $1.2 billion in the prior year, substantially all of which were recorded in legacy franchises. excluding these divestiture-related impacts, expenses increased 8% versus the prior year, largely driven by the following:
•approximately 2% by transformation investments, with about two-thirds related to the risk, controls, data and finance programs (approximately 25% of the program investments were related to technology).
•approximately 1% by business-led investments, as citi continues to hire commercial and investment bankers, as well as client advisors in global wealth, and continues to invest in client experience, front-office platforms and onboarding.
•approximately 3% by other risk and control investments and inflation, partially offset by a revlon-related wire transfer recovery, productivity savings, the impact of foreign exchange translation and the expense reduction from the exit markets.
citi expects to incur higher expenses in 2023, primarily driven by transformation-related investments, volume-related expenses and inflation-related impacts.
cost of credit citi's total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims was a cost of $5.2 billion, compared to a benefit of $3.8 billion in the prior year. results in 2022 included net credit losses of $3.8 billion versus $4.9 billion in the prior year. the higher cost of credit was driven by the net build of $1.2 billion in the acl for loans and unfunded commitments, compared to a net acl release of $8.8 billion in the prior year, partially offset by the lower net credit losses. the net acl build was primarily due to cards loan growth in pbwm and a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions. for additional information on citi's acl, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates-citi's allowance for credit losses (acl)" below.
net credit losses of $3.8 billion decreased 23% from the prior year, largely driven by lower consumer net credit losses. consumer net credit losses decreased 20% to $3.6 billion, reflecting low loss rates in the first half of 2022, followed by the ongoing normalization of losses toward pre-pandemic levels, particularly in retail services cards business in pbwm. corporate net credit losses decreased 54% to $178 million, largely driven by improvements in portfolio credit quality.
citi expects to incur higher net credit losses in 2023, primarily driven by continued normalization toward pre-pandemic levels, particularly in the cards business in pbwm.
for additional information on citi's consumer and corporate credit costs, see each respective business's results of operations and "credit risk" below.
capital citigroup's cet1 capital ratio was 13.0% as of december
31, 2022, compared to 12.2% as of december 31, 2021, based on the basel iii standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets (rwa). the increase was primarily driven by net income, impacts from the closing of the australia, philippines and other asia consumer banking business sales and business actions to reduce rwa, partially offset by the return of capital to common shareholders and interest rate impacts on citigroup's investment portfolio. the increase in citi's cet1 capital ratio was also partially offset by the impact of adopting the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (sa-ccr) on january 1, 2022.
citigroup's supplementary leverage ratio as of december 31, 2022 was 5.8%, compared to 5.7% as of december 31, 2021. the increase was driven by a decrease in total leverage exposure, partly offset by lower tier 1 capital. for additional information on citi's capital ratios and related components, see "capital resources" below.
citi has continued to pause common share repurchases in order to absorb any temporary capital impacts related to any potential signing of a sale agreement for its mexico consumer and small business and middle-market banking (mexico consumer/sbmm) business (for additional information, see "macroeconomic and other risks and uncertainties" and the capital return risk factor in "risk factors" below) and to continue to have ample capital to serve its clients.
institutional clients group icg net income of $10.7 billion decreased 25%, driven by a net acl release in the prior year, versus a net acl build in the current year, and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues. icg operating expenses of $26.3 billion increased 10%, primarily driven by continued investment in citi's transformation, business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by a revlon-related wire transfer recovery, the impact of foreign exchange translation and productivity savings.
icg revenues of $41.2 billion increased 3% (including losses on loan hedges), as revenue growth in services and markets was partially offset by lower revenues in banking. results included a gain on loan hedges of $307 million, compared with a loss on loan hedges of $140 million in the prior year.
services revenues of $16.0 billion increased 27%. treasury and trade solutions (tts) revenues of $12.2 billion increased 32%, driven by 46% growth in net interest income and 10% growth in non-interest revenue. the strong performance in tts was driven by the benefit of higher interest rates, as well as business actions, including balance sheet optimization and managing deposit pricing, deepening of relationships with existing clients and an increase in new clients across segments. securities services revenues of $3.9 billion increased 15%, as net interest income increased 59%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by a 1% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of lower global financial markets.
markets revenues of $19.1 billion increased 7% versus the prior year, largely driven by fixed income markets, partially offset by lower client activity levels in equity markets, as well as business actions to reduce rwa. fixed income markets revenues of $14.6 billion increased 13%, driven by strength in rates and currencies. equity markets revenues of $4.6 billion were down 9%, largely reflecting reduced client activity in equity derivatives versus the prior year.
banking revenues of $6.1 billion decreased 35%, including the gain on loan hedges in the current year and loss on loan hedges in the prior year. excluding the gain and loss on loan hedges, banking revenues of $5.8 billion decreased 39%, driven by lower revenues in investment banking and corporate lending. investment banking revenues of $3.1 billion decreased 53%, as heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity. excluding the gain and loss on loan hedges, corporate lending revenues decreased 8% versus the prior year, driven by the impact of foreign currency translation, higher cost of funds and higher hedging costs.
for additional information on the results of operations of icg in 2022, see "institutional clients group" below.
personal banking and wealth management pbwm net income of $3.3 billion decreased 57% versus the prior year, largely driven by a net acl release in the prior year versus a net acl build in the current year, as well as higher expenses. pbwm operating expenses of $16.3 billion increased 11%, primarily driven by continued investments in citi's transformation, other risk and control initiatives, volume-related expenses and business-led investments, partially offset by productivity savings.
pbwm revenues of $24.2 billion increased 4% versus the prior year, as net interest income growth, driven by strong loan growth across branded cards and retail services and higher interest rates, was partially offset by a decline in non-interest revenue, driven by lower investment product revenue in global wealth and higher partner payments in retail services.
u.s. personal banking revenues of $16.8 billion increased 7% versus the prior year. branded cards revenues of $8.9 billion increased 9%, driven by higher net interest income. in branded cards, new account acquisitions increased 11%, card spend volumes increased 16% and average loans increased 11%. retail services revenues of $5.5 billion increased 7%, driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by higher partner payments. retail banking revenues of $2.5 billion were largely unchanged versus the prior year, as higher interest income and modest deposit growth were offset by lower mortgage revenues due to fewer mortgage originations.
global wealth revenues of $7.4 billion decreased 2% versus the prior year, as investment product revenue headwinds, particularly in asia, more than offset net interest income growth from higher interest rates and higher loan and deposit volumes.

legacy franchises legacy franchises net loss of $12 million compared to net income of $1 million in the prior year, primarily driven by higher cost of credit, partially offset by lower expenses and higher revenues, primarily reflecting the philippines and thailand gains on sales in the current year and the australia loss on sale in the prior year. legacy franchises expenses of $7.8 billion decreased 6%, largely driven by the absence of the korea verp charge in the prior year and the benefit from closing the five exit markets, partially offset by the $535 million goodwill impairment, an approximate $70 million impairment of long-lived assets related to the russia consumer banking business and $156 million of other aggregate divestiture-related costs.
legacy franchises revenues of $8.5 billion increased 3% versus the prior year, primarily driven by the philippines and thailand gains on sale versus the australia loss on sale in the prior year. excluding these divestiture-related impacts, revenues decreased 15%, primarily driven by the reduction in revenues from the closings of the five exit markets, as well as the impact of the ongoing korea and russia wind-downs.
for additional information on the results of operations of legacy franchises in 2022, see "legacy franchises" below.
corporate/other corporate/other net income was $879 million, compared to a net loss of $8 million in the prior year, reflecting higher revenue and lower expenses, partially offset by lower income tax benefits, as well as the second quarter of 2022 release of a cta (cumulative translation adjustment) loss (net of hedges) from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (aoci) related to the substantial liquidation of a legacy u.k. consumer operation, recorded in discontinued operations. corporate/other operating expenses of $953 million decreased 31%, primarily driven by lower consulting expenses and the impact of certain legal settlements.
corporate/other revenues of $1.4 billion increased from $0.5 billion in the prior year, driven by higher net interest income, primarily from the investment portfolio, partially offset by lower non-interest revenue, primarily due to the absence of mark-to-market gains in the prior year as well as higher hedging costs.
for additional information on the results of operations of corporate/other in 2022, see "corporate/other" below.
macroeconomic and other risks and uncertainties various geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties continue to adversely impact economic conditions in the u.s. and globally. the u.s. and other countries have continued to experience significantly elevated levels of inflation, resulting in central banks implementing a series of interest rates increases, with additional increases expected in the near term. in addition to causing a humanitarian crisis, the war in ukraine continues to disrupt energy and food markets. an economic rebound in china remains uncertain, due to the ongoing impacts from covid-19, the amount of leverage in its economy and stress in the property sector. these and other factors have adversely affected financial markets, negatively impacted global economic growth rates, contributed to lower consumer confidence and increased the risk of recession in europe, the u.s. and other countries. these and other factors could adversely affect citi's customers, clients, businesses, funding costs, expenses and results during 2023.
in addition, citi could incur a significant loss on sale in 2023, due to cta losses (net of hedges) in aoci, goodwill write-offs and other aoci loss components, related to the potential signing of a sale agreement for any of its remaining consumer banking divestitures. the majority of these losses would be regulatory capital neutral at closing.
for a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks that will or could impact citi's businesses, results of operations, capital and other financial condition during 2023, see "2022 results summary" above and "risk factors," each respective business's results of operations and "managing global risk," including "managing global risk-other risks-country risk-russia," below.
citi's consent order compliance citi has embarked on a multiyear transformation, with the target outcome to change citi's business and operating models such that they simultaneously strengthen risk and controls and improve citi's value to customers, clients and shareholders.
this includes efforts to effectively implement the october 2020 federal reserve board (frb) and office of the comptroller of the currency (occ) consent orders issued to citigroup and citibank, respectively. in the second quarter of 2021, citi made an initial submission to the occ, and submitted its plans to address the consent orders to both regulators during the third quarter of 2021. citi continues to work constructively with the regulators and provides to both regulators on an ongoing basis additional information regarding its plans and progress. citi will continue to reflect their feedback in its project plans and execution efforts.
as discussed above, citi's efforts include continued investments in its transformation, including the remediation of its consent orders. citi's ceo has made the strengthening of citi's risk and control environment a strategic priority and has established a chief administrative officer organization to centralize program management. in addition, the citigroup and citibank boards of directors each formed a transformation oversight committee, an ad hoc committee of each board, to provide oversight of management's remediation efforts under the consent orders. the citi board of directors has determined that citi's plans are responsive to the company's objectives and that progress continues to be made on execution of the plans.
for additional information about the consent orders, see "risk factors-compliance risks" below and citi's current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on october 7, 2020.

(3)total stockholders' equity and the majority of long-term debt of citigroup are reflected on the citigroup parent company balance sheet (see notes 18 and 30). citigroup allocates stockholders' equity and long-term debt to its businesses through intersegment allocations as shown above.

(5)corporate/other equity represents noncontrolling interests.
institutional clients group institutional clients group (icg) includes services, markets and banking (for additional information on these businesses, see "citigroup operating segments" above). icg provides corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, cash management, trade finance and securities services. icg transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products.
icg's revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities. icg earns fee income for assisting clients with transactional services and clearing and providing brokerage and investment banking services and other such activities. such fees are recognized at the point in time when citigroup's performance under the terms of a contractual arrangement is completed, which is typically at the trade/execution date or closing of a transaction. revenue generated from these activities is recorded in commissions and fees and investment banking fees. revenue is also generated from assets under custody and administration, which is recognized as/when the associated promised service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the point in time the service is requested by the customer and provided by citi. revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in administration and other fiduciary fees. for additional information on these various types of revenues, see note 5.
in addition, as a market maker, icg facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. these price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in principal transactions. mark-to-market gains and losses on certain credit derivatives (used to economically hedge the corporate loan portfolio) are also recorded in principal transactions (for additional information on principal transactions revenue, see note 6). other primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (afs) debt securities, gains and losses on equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and losses. interest income earned on assets held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt, secured funding transactions and customers deposits, is recorded as net interest income.
the amount and types of markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence and other macroeconomic conditions. assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. however, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product inventory. for example, a decrease in market liquidity may increase bid/offer spreads, decrease client activity levels and widen credit spreads on product inventory positions. icg's management of the markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of the above factors at the trading desk as well as the country level.
in the markets businesses, client revenues are those revenues directly attributable to client transactions at the time of inception, including commissions, interest or fees earned. client revenues do not include the results of client facilitation activities (e.g., holding product inventory in anticipation of client demand) or the results of certain economic hedging activities.
icg's international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95 countries and jurisdictions. as previously disclosed, citi intends to end nearly all of the institutional banking services it offers in russia by the end of the first quarter of 2023. going forward, citi's only operations in russia will be those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations. at this time, the estimated cost to be incurred in relation to this action is approximately $80 million (excluding the impact from any portfolio sales), primarily through 2024. for additional information about citi's continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposure in russia, see "legacy franchises" and "managing global risk-other risks-country risk-russia" below.
at december 31, 2022, icg had $1.7 trillion in assets and $845 billion in deposits. securities services managed $22.2 trillion in assets under custody and administration at december 31, 2022, of which citi provided both custody and administrative services to certain clients related to $1.9 trillion of such assets. managed assets under trust were $4.0 trillion at december 31, 2022. for additional information on these operations, see "administration and other fiduciary fees" in note 5.

(1)    citi assesses its markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. for example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk managed by derivatives that are recorded in principal transactions revenue within non-interest revenue. for a description of the composition of these revenue line items, see notes 4, 5 and 6.
(2)    credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. gain (loss) on loan hedges include the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. the fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. citigroup's results of operations excluding the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges are non-gaap financial measures.
nm not meaningful the discussion of the results of operations for icg below excludes (where noted) the impact of any gain (loss) on hedges of accrual loans, which are non-gaap financial measures. for a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.
net income of $10.7 billion decreased 25%, primarily driven by substantially higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.
revenues increased 3% (including gain (loss) on loan hedges), primarily reflecting higher services and markets revenues, partially offset by lower banking revenues. services revenues were up 27%, driven by higher revenues in both tts and securities services. markets revenues were up 7%, primarily driven by higher fixed income markets revenues, partially offset by lower equity markets revenues and the impact of business actions taken to reduce rwa.
banking revenues were down 35% (39% excluding the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges), reflecting lower revenues in both investment banking and corporate lending.
citi expects that revenues in its markets and investment banking businesses will continue to reflect the overall market environment during 2023.
within services:
•tts revenues increased 32%, driven by 46% growth in net interest income and 10% growth in non-interest revenue, driven by deepening of existing client relations and gaining new clients across segments. the increase in net interest income was driven by both the cash and trade businesses, reflecting benefits from higher interest rates, balance sheet optimization, higher average deposits and higher average loans. average deposits grew 1%, as volume growth was partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. average loans grew 11%, primarily driven by the strength in trade flows in asia and latin america, partially offset by loan sales in north america. strong non-interest revenues growth across both cash and trade businesses reflected client engagement and growth from underlying drivers, including higher u.s. dollar clearing volumes (up 2%), cross-border flows (up 11%) and commercial card spend (up 49%).
•securities services revenues increased 15%, primarily driven by an increase in net interest income, reflecting higher interest rates across currencies as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation. non-interest revenues decreased 1%, due to the impact of foreign exchange translation and lower fees in the custody business tied to lower assets under custody and administration (decline of 7%), driven by declines in global financial markets. the decline in non-interest revenues was partially offset by continued elevated levels of corporate activity in issuer services and new client onboarding of $1.2 trillion in assets under custody and administration. average deposits declined 7%, due to clients seeking higher rate alternatives.
within markets:
•fixed income markets revenues increased 13%, driven by growth in rates and currencies across all regions, due to strong corporate and investor client engagement, partially offset by a decline in spread products, primarily driven by north america.
•rates and currencies revenues increased 34%, reflecting increased market volatility, driven by rising interest rates and quantitative tightening, as central banks responded to elevated levels of inflation. spread products and other fixed income revenues decreased 31%, due to continued lower client activity across spread products and a challenging credit market due to widening spreads for most of the year. the decline in spread products and other fixed income revenues was partially offset by strength in commodities, particularly with corporate clients, as the business assisted those clients in managing risk associated with the increased volatility.
•equity markets revenues decreased 9%, driven by equity derivatives, primarily reflecting lower activity by both corporate and institutional clients compared to a strong prior year. the lower revenues also reflected a decline in equity cash, driven by lower client activity.
within banking:
•investment banking revenues were down 53%, reflecting a significant decline in the overall market wallet and loss in wallet share, as heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity. advisory revenues decreased 24%, reflecting a decline in north america and emea, driven by the decline in the market wallet as well as loss in wallet share. equity and debt underwriting revenues decreased 73% and 56% respectively, reflecting a decline in north america, emea and asia and driven by the decline in the market wallet as well as wallet share loss. the decline in debt underwriting revenues also reflected markdowns on loan commitments and losses on loan sales.
•corporate lending revenues increased 8%, including the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges. excluding the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges, revenues decreased 8%, primarily driven by the impacts of foreign currency translation, higher cost of funds and higher hedging costs.
expenses were up 10%, primarily driven by continued investment in citi's transformation, business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by a revlon-related wire transfer recovery, the impact of foreign exchange translation and productivity savings.
provisions were $911 million, compared to a benefit of $2.5 billion in the prior year, driven by an acl build, partially offset by lower net credit losses.
net credit losses declined to $152 million, compared to $356 million in the prior year, driven by improvements in portfolio credit quality.
the acl build was $759 million, compared to a release of $2.8 billion in the prior year. the acl build was primarily driven by a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions. for additional information on citi's acl, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates" below.

net income was $3.3 billion, compared to $7.7 billion in the prior year, reflecting significantly higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.
revenues increased 4%, primarily due to higher net interest income, driven by strong loan growth in branded cards and retail services and higher interest rates. the increase was partially offset by lower non-interest revenue, reflecting lower investment product revenue in global wealth and higher partner payments in retail services resulting from higher revenues.
cards revenues increased 8%. branded cards revenues increased 9%, primarily driven by higher net interest income on higher loan balances. branded cards new account acquisitions increased 11% and card spend volume increased 16%. average loans increased 11%, reflecting the higher card spend volumes.
retail services revenues increased 7%, primarily driven by higher net interest income on higher loan balances and lower payment rates, partially offset by the increase in partner payments. the increase in partner payments reflected higher income sharing as a result of higher revenues (for additional information on partner payments, see note 5). retail services credit card spend volume increased 8% and average loans increased 6%, reflecting the higher card spend volumes.
retail banking revenues were largely unchanged, as the higher interest rates and modest deposit growth were offset by lower mortgage revenues due to fewer mortgage originations, driven by the higher interest rates. average deposits increased 3%, largely reflecting higher levels of consumer liquidity in the first half of 2022.
global wealth revenues decreased 2%, reflecting investment product revenue headwinds, particularly in asia, driven by overall market volatility, partially offset by net interest income growth, driven by higher interest rates and higher loan and deposit volumes. average loans increased 2% and average deposits increased 5%. client assets decreased 8%, primarily driven by declines in equity market valuations. global wealth advisors increased 4% during 2022. private bank revenues decreased 6%, citigold revenues decreased 1% and wealth at work revenues increased 6%.
expenses increased 11%, primarily driven by continued investments in citi's transformation, other risk and control initiatives, volume-related expenses and business-led investments, partially offset by productivity savings.
provisions were $3.8 billion, compared to a benefit of $1.2 billion in the prior year, largely driven by a net acl build. net credit losses decreased 1%, driven by historically low loss rates experienced in the first half of 2022, followed by the ongoing normalization of losses toward pre-pandemic levels, particularly in retail services (net credit losses up 7% to $1.3 billion). branded cards net credit losses declined 17% to $1.4 billion.
the net acl build was $0.7 billion, compared to a net release of $4.3 billion in the prior year, primarily driven by u.s. cards loan growth and a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions. for additional information on citi's acl, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates" below.

legacy franchises as of december 31, 2022, legacy franchises included (i) asia consumer banking (asia consumer), representing the consumer banking operations of the remaining eight asia and emea exit countries; (ii) mexico consumer banking (mexico consumer) and mexico small business and middle-market banking (mexico sbmm), collectively mexico consumer/sbmm, which citi also plans to exit; and (iii) legacy holdings assets (certain north america consumer mortgage loans and other legacy assets). asia consumer provides traditional retail banking and branded card products to retail and small business customers. mexico consumer/sbmm provides traditional retail banking and branded card products to consumers and small business customers and traditional middle-market banking products and services to commercial customers through citibanamex.
legacy franchises also included the following consumer banking businesses prior to their sale: australia, until its closing on june 1, 2022; the philippines, until its closing on august 1, 2022; thailand and malaysia, until their closings on november 1, 2022; and bahrain, until its closing on december 1, 2022. in addition, citi has entered into agreements to sell its consumer banking businesses in india, indonesia, taiwan and vietnam, and announced its wind-down of consumer banking operations in korea and china and consumer banking and local commercial banking operations in russia (see below). in december 2022, citi announced the pursuit of sales of portfolios within its china consumer banking business, subject to applicable regulations. see note 2 for additional information on legacy franchises' consumer banking business sales and wind-downs.
as previously disclosed, citi announced the wind-down of its consumer banking and local commercial banking operations in russia, including its active pursuit of sales of certain russia consumer banking portfolios. in connection with this wind-down plan, citi expects to incur approximately $110 million in costs (excluding the impact from any portfolio sales), primarily through 2024, largely driven by restructuring, vendor termination fees and other related charges. in december 2022, citi (i) sold a portfolio of ruble-denominated personal installment loans, totaling approximately $240 million in outstanding loan balances as of the fourth quarter of 2022 and (ii) entered into a referral agreement to settle a portfolio of ruble-denominated credit card loans, subject to customer consents; the outstanding card loans balance was approximately $219 million as of the fourth quarter of 2022. for additional information about citi's continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposure in russia, see "institutional clients group" above and "risk factors" and "managing global risk-other risks-country risk-russia" below.
at december 31, 2022, on a combined basis, legacy franchises had 1,438 retail branches, $23 billion in retail banking loans and $51 billion in deposits. in addition, the businesses had $8 billion in outstanding card loan balances, and mexico sbmm had $7 billion in outstanding corporate loan balances. these amounts exclude approximately $12 billion of loans ($9 billion of retail banking loans and $3 billion of credit card loan balances) and approximately $16 billion of deposits, all of which were reclassified to other assets and other liabilities held-for-sale (hfs) as a result of citi's agreements to sell its consumer banking businesses in india, indonesia, taiwan and vietnam. see note 2 for additional information.

net loss was $12 million, compared to net income of $1 million in the prior year, primarily driven by higher cost of credit, partially offset by lower expenses and higher revenues.
results for 2022 included divestiture-related impacts of approximately $87 million (approximately $(180) million after-tax), which primarily consisted of (i) an approximate $618 million philippines gain on sale recorded in revenues, (ii) an approximate $209 million thailand gain on sale recorded in revenues, (iii) an approximate $(64) million incremental australia consumer banking loss on sale recorded in revenues, (iv) an approximate $535 million goodwill impairment recorded in expenses and (v) an approximate $156 million of other aggregate divestiture-related costs.
results for 2021 included divestiture-related impacts of approximately $(1.9) billion (approximately $(1.6) billion after-tax), which primarily consisted of (i) an approximate $(694) million australia loss on sale recorded in revenues, (ii) an approximate $1.1 billion related to charges incurred from the voluntary early retirement program (verp) in connection with the wind-down of the korea consumer banking business recorded in expenses and (iii) contract modification costs related to the asia divestitures of approximately $119 million recorded in expenses.
revenues increased 3%, primarily driven by higher revenues in asia consumer and mexico consumer/sbmm, partially offset by lower legacy holdings assets revenues.
asia consumer revenues increased 12%, primarily driven by the philippines and thailand gains on sale, versus the australia loss on sale in the prior year, partially offset by the loss of revenues from the closing of the five exit markets and impacts of the ongoing korea and russia wind-downs.
mexico consumer/sbmm revenues increased 2%, as cards revenues in mexico consumer increased 7% and sbmm revenues increased 9%, primarily due to higher interest rates and higher deposit and loan growth. the increase in revenues was partially offset by a 1% decrease in retail banking revenues, primarily driven by lower fiduciary fees reflecting declines in equity market valuations.
legacy holdings assets revenues of $(90) million decreased from $195 million in the prior year, largely driven by a cta loss (net of hedges) recorded in aoci in the second quarter of 2022, related to the substantial liquidation of a legacy u.k. consumer operation (for additional information, see "corporate/other" below and note 2), as well as the continued wind-down of legacy holdings assets.
expenses decreased 6%, primarily driven by the absence of the $1.2 billion divestiture-related costs in the prior year, including the korea verp of approximately $1.1 billion and contract modification costs related to asia divestiture markets of approximately $119 million, and the benefit from the closing of the five exit markets. the decline was partially offset by an approximate $535 million goodwill impairment in the first quarter of 2022, an approximate $70 million impairment of long-lived assets related to the russia consumer banking business in the second quarter of 2022 and approximately $156 million of other aggregate divestiture-related costs.
provisions were $571 million, compared to a benefit of $62 million in the prior year, primarily driven by a lower net acl release, partially offset by lower net credit losses. net credit losses decreased 58%, primarily reflecting improved delinquencies in both asia consumer and mexico consumer and the reclassification of loans and net credit losses to reflect hfs accounting as a result of the signing of sale agreements for the aforementioned consumer banking businesses in asia consumer.
the net acl release was $136 million, compared to a net release of $1.6 billion in the prior year. the continued release primarily reflected further improvement in portfolio credit quality. for additional information on citi's acl, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates" below.

net income was $879 million, compared to a net loss of $8 million in the prior year, reflecting higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by lower income tax benefits and a second quarter of 2022 release of a cta loss (net of hedges) from aoci, recorded in discontinued operations, related to the substantial liquidation of a u.k. consumer legacy operation (for additional information, see "legacy franchises" above and note 2).
revenues were $1.4 billion, compared to $470 million in the prior year, driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by lower non-interest revenue. the higher net interest income was primarily due to the investment portfolio driven by higher balances, higher interest rates and lower mortgage-backed securities prepayments, partially offset by higher cost of funds related to higher institutional certificates of deposit. the lower non-interest revenue was primarily due to the absence of mark-to-market gains in the prior year as well as higher hedging costs.

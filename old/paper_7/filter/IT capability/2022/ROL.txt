the company rollins, inc. ("rollins," "we," "us," "our," or the "company"), is an international services company headquartered in atlanta, georgia that provides pest and termite control services to both residential and commercial customers through its wholly-owned subsidiaries and independent franchises in the united states, canada, australia, europe, and asia with international franchises in canada, central and south america, the caribbean, europe, the middle east, asia, africa, and australia. our pest and termite control services are performed pursuant to terms of contracts that specify the pricing arrangement with the customer. the company operates as one reportable segment and the results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single customer.
general operating comments we finished 2022 with record revenue of $2.7 billion. we have consistently grown revenue and 2022 represented another strong year for growth. we experienced strong growth across all major service lines driving 11% total growth in revenues. residential service revenue increased 10%, commercial revenue growth was also 10% and termite and ancillary revenue growth was 15%. income before income taxes increased 3.4% to $498.9 million compared to $482.5 million the prior year. net income increased 3.4% to $368.6 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.75 compared to $356.6 million, or $0.72 per diluted share for the prior year. operating cash flow remained strong in 2022 and finished at $465.9 million up from $401.8 million in 2021. we repaid debt by $100 million in 2022, we paid $119 million for 31 acquisitions in 2022 and a final payment on a 2021 acquisition, and continued to increase dividends to investors. the company paid dividends to investors of $0.43 per diluted share in 2022 as compared to $0.42 per diluted share for the prior year, resulting in a 2.4% increase in dividends per share.
while we continue to monitor macro-economic and other risks facing our business, we are starting 2023 with a strong foundation. demand remains strong in our business with revenue growth of 11% in january 2023. our balance sheet also provides us flexibility with debt remaining at very low levels to start the new year. we plan to evaluate opportunities to renegotiate our current credit facility that will be expiring in april 2024. our pipeline for acquisitions is strong and we remain very well positioned to drive growth across all of our service lines in 2023.
impact of the pandemic and other economic trends the global spread and unprecedented impact of covid-19 has continued to create uncertainty and economic disruption around the world during 2022. we have and will continue to monitor covid-19 and may again take actions that may alter our operations, including those that may be required by federal, state, or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees and customers. we do not know when, or if, it will become practical to eliminate all of these measures entirely as there is no guarantee that covid-19 will be fully contained.
in addition, continued disruption in economic markets due to high inflation, increases in interest rates, increased fuel costs, business interruptions due to natural disasters, employee shortages and supply chain issues, all pose challenges which may adversely affect our future performance. the company continues to carry out various strategies previously implemented to help mitigate the impact of these economic disruptors, including revamping its routing and scheduling process to decrease the number of miles per stop, advanced scheduling to compensate for employee and vehicle shortages, and maintaining higher purchasing levels to allow for sufficient inventory.
however, the company cannot reasonably estimate whether these strategies will help mitigate the impact of these economic disruptors in the future.
the company's condensed consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions made by management that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements. the company considered the impact of covid-19 and other economic trends on the assumptions and estimates used in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements. in the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the company's financial results for the year have been made. these adjustments are of a normal recurring nature but complicated by the continued uncertainty surrounding covid-19 and other economic trends. the severity, magnitude and duration of certain economic trends, as well as the economic consequences of covid-19, continue to be uncertain and are difficult to predict. therefore, our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to covid-19 and other economic trends and may change materially in future periods.
the extent to which covid-19, increasing interest rates, inflation and other economic trends will continue to impact the company's business, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain. therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the full future impacts of these matters at this time.

provision for income taxes                                                                   130,318                    125,920         4,398           3.5         4.8             5.2
revenues for the year ended december 31, 2022 were $2.7 billion, an increase of $271.5 million, or 11.2%, from 2021 revenues of $2.4 billion. comparing 2022 to 2021, residential pest control revenue increased 10%, commercial pest control revenue increased 10% and termite and ancillary services grew 15%. the company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 7% and 8% of total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2022 was $1.4 billion, an increase of $125.7 million, or 10.0%, compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. gross margin was 51.5% in 2022 compared to 52.0% in 2021. for the year, we saw higher expenses associated with casualty reserves and people cost, notably medical costs. excluding the increases we experienced in these areas, strategic pricing efforts helped offset inflationary pressures we experienced in fleet, material and other people associated costs. we remain focused on executing our pricing strategies and expect to pull forward our price increase again in 2023 and expect to raise prices for services in the first quarter.
sales, general and administrative for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, sales, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses increased $75.2 million, or 10.3%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2021. as a percentage of revenue, sg&a decreased to 29.8% from 30.0% in the prior year. despite investing in additional people, advertising and other customer facing activities to drive growth, we saw an
improvement in sg&a as a percentage of sales as we continue to manage our cost structure. although casualty reserves and people costs, notably medical costs, had an impact on sg&a, they had a lesser impact on sg&a than cost of services.
depreciation and amortization for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, depreciation and amortization increased $4.8 million, or 5.5%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2021. the increase was due to the additional amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions offset by a decrease in the depreciation of operating equipment and internal-use software.
operating income for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, operating income increased $45.8 million or 10.2% compared to the prior year. as a percentage of revenue, operating income decreased to 18.3% from 18.5% in the prior year. the increase in revenue was offset primarily by an increase in expense associated with the casualty reserve as well as medical costs for people. without these additional costs, pricing initiatives helped offset inflationary pressures we experienced in fleet, material and other people associated costs.
other income, net during the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, other income decreased $27.5 million primarily due to the company recognizing a $31.5 million gain in the prior year related to multiple sale-leaseback transactions where the company sold and leased back properties that it acquired in 2019 with the clark pest control acquisition.
income taxes the company's effective tax rate was 26.1% in both 2022 and 2021. the 2022 rate was favorably impacted by lower foreign income taxes and officer's compensation deductions, offset by an increase in state income taxes and lower restricted stock adjustments.
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash flow the company's $95.3 million of total cash at december 31, 2022 is held at various banking institutions. approximately $68.6 million is held in cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining $26.7 million is held in federal deposit insurance corporation ("fdic") insured non-interest-bearing accounts at various domestic banks which at times exceed federally insured amounts.
the company's international business is expanding, and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. the company has historically asserted that the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested. however, in the fourth quarter of 2022, the company has partially changed this assertion and expects to repatriate unremitted foreign earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. the company asserts that we continue to be permanently reinvested with respect to our investments in our foreign subsidiaries.
in april 2019, the company entered into a revolving credit agreement with truist bank n.a. (formerly suntrust bank n.a.) and bank of america, n.a. (the "2019 credit agreement") for an unsecured revolving commitment of up to $175.0 million, which includes a $75.0 million letter of credit subfacility and a $25.0 million swingline subfacility (the "revolving commitment"), and an unsecured variable rate $250.0 million term loan (the "term loan"). on january 27, 2022, the company entered into an amendment (the "amendment") to the credit agreement with truist bank and bank of america, n.a. whereby additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $252.0 million were advanced to the company. the amendment also replaced libor as the benchmark interest
rate for borrowings with the bloomberg short-term bank yield index rate ("bsby") and reset the amortization schedule for all term loans under the credit agreement.
as of december 31, 2022, the company had outstanding borrowings of $54.9 million under the term loan and there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving commitment. the aggregate effective interest rate on the debt outstanding as of december 31, 2022 was 5.123%. the effective interest rate is comprised of the bsby plus a margin of 75.0 basis points as determined by the company's leverage ratio calculation. as of december 31, 2021, the revolving commitment had outstanding borrowings of $107.0 million and the term loan had outstanding borrowings of $48.0 million.
the company maintains approximately $71.3 million in letters of credit as of december 31, 2022. these letters of credit are required by the company's insurance companies, due to the company's high deductible insurance program, to secure various workers' compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage and were increased from $37.2 million as of december 31, 2021. the company believes that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate potential future insurance claims.
in order to comply with applicable debt covenants, the company is required to maintain at all times a leverage ratio of not greater than 3.00:1.00. the leverage ratio is calculated as of the last day of the fiscal quarter most recently ended. the company remained in compliance with applicable debt covenants at december 31, 2022. we plan to evaluate opportunities to renegotiate our credit facility that will be expiring in april 2024.
the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2022 and 2021:
net cash provided by operating activities                  $465,930                          $401,805         64,125           16.0

effect of exchange rate on cash                                     (5,727)                   (5,857)            130            2.2
cash provided by operating activities cash from operating activities is the principal source of cash generation for our businesses. the most significant source of cash in our cash flow from operations is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from services sold. the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, and tax and regulatory authorities. the company's operations generated cash of $465.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared with cash provided by operating activities of $401.8 million in 2021. the $64.1 million increase was driven primarily by strong operating results and the timing of cash receipts from customers and cash payments to vendors, employees, and tax and regulatory authorities.
cash used in investing activities the company used $134.1 million of cash in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2022 and used $99.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the company invested approximately $30.6 million in capital expenditures during 2022 compared to $27.2 million during 2021. capital expenditures for the year consisted primarily of property purchases, equipment replacements and technology-related projects. cash paid for acquisitions totaled $119.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 as compared to $146.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the expenditures for the company's acquisitions were funded through existing cash balances and operating cash flows. the company remains very active in evaluating opportunities for acquisitions and expects to make additional acquisitions in 2023. the year ended december 31, 2021 included approximately $67 million in cash proceeds from the sale of assets related to the clark pest control property sale-leaseback transactions.
cash used in financing activities the company used $336.0 million of cash in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2022 and $290.2 million in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2021. the company made net debt repayments of $100.0 million during the year ended
in 2012, the company's board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 5 million shares of the company's common stock. after adjustments for stock splits, the total authorized shares under the share repurchase plan are 16.9 million shares. the company did not purchase shares on the open market during the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. there remain 11.4 million shares authorized to be repurchased under prior board approval and the repurchase plan does not expire. the company repurchased $7.1 million, $10.7 million, and $8.3 million of common stock for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, from employees for the payment of taxes on vesting restricted shares.
rollins maintains adequate liquidity and capital resources, without regard to its foreign deposits, that are directed to finance domestic operations and obligations and to fund expansion of its domestic business. the company believes its current cash and cash equivalents balances, future cash flows expected to be generated from operating activities, and available borrowings under its $175 million revolving credit facility and $300 million term loan facility will be sufficient to finance its current operations and obligations, and fund expansion of the business for the foreseeable future. we expect to maintain compliance with applicable debt covenants throughout 2023.
litigation for discussion on the company's legal contingencies, see note 13 - commitments and contingencies to the accompanying financial statements, and part i, item 3, legal proceedings.
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the impact that the company's contractual obligations as of december 31, 2022 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows:
acquisition holdbacks and earnouts                  13,496               10,988                2,508              -                   -
critical accounting estimates the company views critical accounting estimates to be those that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require management's most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. we believe our critical accounting estimate to be as follows:
accrued insurance-the company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers' compensation and auto liability. risks are managed through either high deductible insurance or, for clark pest control only, a non-affiliated group captive insurance member arrangement. the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. the group captive is subject to a third-party actuary retained by the captive manager, independent from the company. for the high deductible insurance program, the company contracts with an independent third-party actuary to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management's knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. management's judgment is inherently subjective as a number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. the company continues to be proactive in safety and risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce and prevent incidents and claims. initiatives that have been implemented include required pre-employment screening and ongoing
motor vehicle record review for all drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, pre-hire, random and post incident drug testing, driver training and post-injury nurse triage for work-related injuries. the accruals and reserves we hold are based on estimates that involve a degree of judgment and are inherently variable and could be overestimated or insufficient. if actual claims exceed our estimates, our operating results could be materially affected, and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited.
recent accounting guidance and other policies and estimates see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion.

we are a diversified healthcare services leader dedicated to advancing health outcomes for patients everywhere. our teams partner with biopharma companies, care providers, pharmacies, manufacturers, governments, and others to deliver insights, products, and services to help make quality care more accessible and affordable.
we report our financial results in four reportable segments: u.s. pharmaceutical, prescription technology solutions ("rxts"), medical-surgical solutions, and international. our organizational structure also includes corporate, which consists of income and expenses associated with administrative functions and projects as well as the results of certain investments. the factors for determining the reportable segments include the manner in which management evaluates the performance of the company combined with the nature of individual business activities. we evaluate the performance of our operating segments on a number of measures, including revenues and operating profit (loss) before interest expense and income taxes.
•u.s. pharmaceutical is a reportable segment that distributes branded, generic, specialty, biosimilar, and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs and other healthcare-related products. this segment also provides practice management, technology, clinical support, and business solutions to community-based oncology and other specialty practices. in addition, the segment sells financial, operational, and clinical solutions to pharmacies (retail, hospital, alternate site) and provides consulting, outsourcing, technological, and other services.
•prescription technology solutions is a reportable segment that combines automation and our ability to navigate the healthcare ecosystems to connect patients, pharmacies, providers, pharmacy benefit managers, health plans, and biopharma companies to address patients' medication access, affordability, and adherence challenges. rxts also offers prescription price transparency, benefit insight, dispensing support services, third-party logistics, and wholesale distribution support across various therapeutic categories and temperature ranges to biopharma customers throughout the product lifecycle.
•medical-surgical solutions is a reportable segment that provides medical-surgical supply distribution, logistics, and other services to healthcare providers in the united states ("u.s."), including physician offices, surgery centers, nursing homes, hospital reference labs, and home health care agencies. this segment offers national brand medical-surgical products as well as mckesson's own line of high-quality products through a network of distribution centers within the u.s.
•international is a reportable segment that includes our operations in europe and canada, bringing together non-u.s.-based drug distribution services, specialty pharmacy, retail, and infusion care services. during fiscal 2023, we completed transactions to sell certain of our businesses in the european union ("e.u.") and our retail and distribution businesses in the united kingdom ("u.k."), and during fiscal 2022, we completed the sale of our austrian business. these divestitures are further described in the "european divestiture activities" section below. our remaining operations in europe provide distribution and services to wholesale, institutional, and retail customers in norway where we own, partner, or franchise with retail pharmacies. our operations in canada deliver vital medicines, supplies and information technology solutions throughout canada and includes rexall health pharmacies.
business acquisitions and divestitures rx savings solutions, llc on november 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares of rx savings solutions, llc ("rxss"), a privately-owned company headquartered in overland park, kansas, to further connect our biopharma and payer services to patients. rxss is a prescription price transparency and benefit insight company that offers affordability and adherence solutions to health plans and employers. the purchase consideration included a payment of $600 million in cash made upon closing and a maximum of $275 million of contingent consideration based on rxss' operational and financial performance through calendar year 2025. the payment made upon closing was funded from cash on hand, and we recorded a liability of $92 million as of the acquisition date representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration. as of march 31, 2023, the current portion of $83 million is included within "other accrued liabilities" and the long-term portion of $9 million is included within "other non-current liabilities" in the company's consolidated balance sheet. the financial results of rxss are included in our rxts segment as of the acquisition date. the transaction was accounted for as a business combination.
scri oncology, llc on october 31, 2022, we completed a transaction with hca to form scri oncology, llc ("scri oncology"), an oncology research business, combining our u.s. oncology research ("usor") and hca's sarah cannon research institute ("scri") based in nashville, tennessee, to advance cancer care and increase access to oncology clinical research. upon consummation of the transaction, we own a 51% controlling interest in the combined business, and the financial results are consolidated and reported within our u.s. pharmaceutical segment as of the acquisition date. transaction consideration included the transfer of full ownership interest in usor to the combined business and $173 million of cash paid to hca, which was funded from cash on hand. the transaction was accounted for as a business combination.
european divestiture activities on october 31, 2022, we completed the previously announced transaction to sell certain of our businesses in the e.u. located in france, italy, ireland, portugal, belgium, and slovenia, along with our german headquarters and wound-care business, part of a shared services center in lithuania, and our ownership stake in a joint venture in the netherlands ("e.u. disposal group") to the phoenix group. as part of the transaction, we received cash proceeds of $892 million and divested net assets of $1.3 billion, including cash of $319 million, derecognized the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest held by minority shareholders of mckesson europe ag ("mckesson europe") of $382 million, and released $153 million of net accumulated other comprehensive loss. we recorded net gains of $66 million and net charges of $438 million for the years ended march 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in "selling, distribution, general, and administrative expenses" in the consolidated statements of operations to remeasure the assets and liabilities of our e.u. disposal group to fair value less costs to sell. the fiscal 2022 charges also included impairments of certain internal-use software that will not be utilized in the future, prior to adjusting the e.u. disposal group as a whole, and net losses of $151 million related to the accumulated other comprehensive loss balances associated with our e.u. disposal group, driven by declines in the euro.
on april 6, 2022, we completed the previously announced sale of our retail and distribution businesses in the u.k. ("u.k. disposal group") to aurelius elephant limited for a purchase price of £110 million (or, approximately $144 million), including certain adjustments. as part of the transaction, we divested net assets of $615 million and released $731 million of accumulated other comprehensive loss. during the year ended march 31, 2022, we recorded charges totaling $1.2 billion within "selling, distribution, general, and administrative expenses" in our consolidated statement of operations to remeasure the u.k. disposal group to fair value less costs to sell. the remeasurement adjustment included a $734 million loss related to the accumulated other comprehensive loss balances associated with the u.k. disposal group, driven by declines in the british pound sterling.
on january 31, 2022, we completed the sale of our austrian business to quadrifolia management gmbh in a management-led buyout for a purchase price of €244 million (or, approximately $276 million), including certain adjustments. during the year ended march 31, 2022, we recognized a loss of $32 million related to this divestiture which was recorded within "selling, distribution, general, and administrative expenses" in our consolidated statement of operations.
as of march 31, 2023, we had no assets or liabilities related to these completed european divestiture activities that met the classification of held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet. subsequent to the divestiture activities discussed above, the company's european operations primarily consist of its retail and distribution businesses in norway.
refer to financial note 2, "business acquisitions and divestitures," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for more information regarding these acquisition and divestiture transactions.
the following summary provides highlights and key factors that impacted our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity for the year ended march 31, 2023:
•for the year ended march 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, revenues increased by 5%, gross profit decreased by 6%, total operating expenses decreased by 28%, and other income, net increased by 92%. refer to the "overview of consolidated results" section below for an analysis of these changes;

•in october 2022, we received $129 million related to our share of an antitrust settlement. this amount was recorded as a gain within "cost of sales" in the consolidated statement of operations within our u.s. pharmaceutical segment;
•in october 2022, we received $126 million due to early termination of a tax receivable agreement ("tra") with change healthcare inc. ("change"). this amount was recorded as a gain within "other income, net" in the consolidated statement of operations within corporate;
•during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we terminated our $500 million notional forward starting fixed interest rate swaps and recognized a gain on the termination of $97 million within "other income, net" in the consolidated statement of operations within corporate;
•in july 2022, we exited one of our investments in equity securities for proceeds of $179 million and recognized a gain of $142 million within "other income, net" in the consolidated statement of operations within our u.s. pharmaceutical segment;
•on march 15, 2023, we retired our $360 million outstanding principal amount of 2.85% notes due 2023 (the "2.85% notes") upon maturity. these notes were repaid using cash on hand;
•on december 15, 2022, we retired our $400 million outstanding principal amount of 2.70% notes due 2022 (the "2.70% notes") upon maturity. these notes were repaid using cash on hand;
•on november 7, 2022, we entered into a syndicated $4.0 billion five-year senior unsecured credit facility (the "2022 credit facility") which matures in november 2027 and replaced our previous syndicated senior unsecured credit facility which was scheduled to mature in september 2024;
•concurrent with our entry into the 2022 credit facility, on november 7, 2022, we entered into a $500 million unsecured delayed draw term loan facility (the "2022 term loan credit facility"). we drew $500 million of cash on the term loan in december 2022 which was used for general corporate purposes and was repaid in february 2023 using proceeds from the 5.25% notes issuance described above;
•mckesson continued to play a leading role in the fight against the disease caused by the sars-cov-2 coronavirus ("covid-19"). in fiscal 2021, we began distributing certain covid-19 vaccines under the direction of the centers for disease control and prevention ("cdc"). since then, and through the end of fiscal 2023, we distributed over 480 million covid-19 vaccine doses to administration sites all across the u.s. and in support of the u.s. government's international donation mission. although contributions from sales of covid-19 tests and our covid-19 vaccine and related ancillary supply kit distribution programs were favorable to our results for the year ended march 31, 2023, they were less favorable compared to fiscal 2022 as the recovery from the pandemic continued. for a more in-depth discussion of how covid-19 impacted our business, operations, financial results, and outlook, refer to the covid-19 section of "trends and uncertainties" included below.
legislative developments on august 16, 2022, the u.s. government enacted the inflation reduction act of 2022 (the "ir act"). among other provisions, the ir act includes a 15% corporate minimum tax, a 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of an entity's own common stock after december 31, 2022, and various drug pricing reforms. based on our preliminary assessment, we do not currently expect the ir act to have a material impact on our results of operations, our financial position, or cash flows in the foreseeable future. we will continue to evaluate the full impact of these legislative changes as they are implemented.
the impact of inflationary and global events our business and our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity are impacted by broad economic conditions including rising interest rates, inflation, increased competition for talent, and disruption of the supply chain, as well as by political or civil unrest or military action. cost inflation generally affects us by increasing transportation, operational, and other administrative costs associated with our business operations which we might not be able to fully pass along to our customers. although it is difficult to predict the impact that these factors may have on our business in the future, they did not have a material impact on our results of operations, our financial condition, or liquidity for the year ended march 31, 2023.
covid-19 has continued to evolve since it was declared a global pandemic by the world health organization on march 11, 2020. we continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the ongoing impacts of covid-19, including the impacts from the continued pandemic recovery, on our business, operations, and financial results. the disclosures below include significant updates that occurred during fiscal 2023 and the financial impacts of covid-19 in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.
our role in the distribution of covid-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits as a diversified healthcare services leader, we have been well positioned to respond to the covid-19 pandemic in the u.s. and canada, and in europe prior to the divestiture of the e.u. and u.k. disposal groups. we work closely with national and local governments, agencies, and industry partners to ensure that available supplies, including personal protective equipment ("ppe"), and medicine reach our customers and their patients.
since december 2020, we have supported the u.s. government as a centralized distributor of covid-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies used to administer vaccines through a contract with the centers for disease control and prevention ("cdc") and, in july 2022, we renewed our relationship with the cdc under this agreement. the results of operations related to this program are reflected in our u.s. pharmaceutical segment. we also continue to operate under a contract to manage the assembly, storage, and distribution of ancillary supply kits needed to administer covid-19 vaccines as directed by the u.s. department of health and human services ("hhs"), the results of which are reflected in our medical-surgical solutions segment. our contracts with the cdc and hhs will continue into july 2023.
mckesson canada, and mckesson europe prior to the divestiture of the e.u. and u.k. disposal groups, support governments and public health entities through distributing covid-19 vaccines and administering them in pharmacies as well as distributing covid-19 tests and certain ppe.
trends in our business we observed growth in prescription volumes within our u.s. pharmaceutical segment and stability in patient visits in our primary care business within our medical-surgical solutions segment during the year ended march 31, 2023, compared to the prior year as the recovery from covid-19 continued. while the u.s. distribution of covid-19 vaccines and related ancillary kits combined with higher sales for covid-19 tests, corresponding to increased demand from the spike in positive covid-19 cases as a result of the delta and omicron variants favorably impacted our results during the year ended march 31, 2022, the contributions from covid-19 tests and our vaccine and related kitting distribution programs decreased year over year in fiscal 2023 primarily driven by lower demand as the pandemic recovery continued.
impact to our supply chain we continue to monitor and address the impacts on our supply chain which were initially related to the covid-19 pandemic. although the availability of various products is dependent on our suppliers, their locations, and the extent to which they continue to be impacted by the covid-19 pandemic, we proactively work with manufacturers, industry partners, and government agencies to meet the needs of our customers. overall, during fiscal 2023, we had an increase in supply chain costs primarily related to transportation and labor; however, this did not materially impact our results of operations for the year ended march 31, 2023. as potential shortages or disruptions of any products are identified, we address supply continuity, which includes securing additional products when available, sourcing back-up products when needed, and following allocation procedures to maintain and protect supply as much as possible. we utilize business continuity action planning to maintain and protect operations across all locations and facilities.
impact to our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity the distribution of covid-19 vaccines in our u.s. pharmaceutical segment decreased during fiscal 2023 when compared to the same prior year period. the contribution was less than 10% to segment operating profit for each of the years ended march 31, 2023 and 2022. the financial impacts from our covid-19 response efforts in the international segment during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 were not material to our consolidated or segment operating results.
for the year ended march 31, 2023, covid-19 tests and the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for covid-19 vaccines in our medical-surgical solutions segment contributed approximately $765 million and $216 million to segment revenues and segment operating profit, respectively. for the year ended march 31, 2022, the contribution was approximately $1.8 billion to segment revenues and, including total inventory charges as further described below, increased our segment operating profit by approximately $208 million.
these covid-19 related items had a net unfavorable impact on consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal 2023 compared to the same prior year period, primarily driven by lower demand for covid-19 tests as well as covid-19 vaccines and related ancillary supply kits.
during the year ended march 31, 2022 we recorded inventory charges totaling $164 million on certain ppe and other related products in our medical-surgical solutions segment. we have taken measures to mitigate risks for market price volatility and changes to anticipated customer demand that may require additional write-downs in future periods of other ppe and related product categories.
during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, we maintained appropriate labor and overall vendor supply levels and experienced no material impacts to our liquidity or net working capital due to the covid-19 pandemic.
opioid-related litigation and claims we are a defendant in many legal proceedings asserting claims related to the distribution of controlled substances (opioids) in federal and state courts throughout the u.s., and in puerto rico and canada. the plaintiffs in these actions have included state attorneys general, county and municipal governments, tribal nations, hospitals, health and welfare funds, third-party payors, and individuals.
the company and two other national pharmaceutical distributors (collectively "distributors") settled with 48 of 49 eligible states and their participating subdivisions, as well as the district of columbia and all eligible territories (collectively, "settling governmental entities") effective on april 2, 2022 (the "settlement"). under the settlement, the distributors will pay the settling governmental entities up to approximately $20.3 billion over 18 years, with up to approximately $7.8 billion to be paid by the company for its 38.1% portion. consent judgments have been entered in all participating states and territories, and approximately 2,300 cases have been dismissed pursuant to the settlement. a minimum of 85% of the settlement payments must be used by state and local governmental entities to remediate the opioid epidemic. most of the remaining percentage relates to plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and costs, and is payable over a shorter time period. under the settlement, the distributors will establish a clearinghouse to consolidate their controlled-substance distribution data, which will be available to the settling u.s. states to use as part of their anti-diversion efforts. the settlement provides that the distributors do not admit liability or wrongdoing and do not waive any defenses.
the settlement only addresses the claims of attorneys general of u.s. states and territories and political subdivisions in participating states and territories. governmental entities not participating in the settlement may continue to pursue their claims. the state of alabama chose not to participate in the settlement, and west virginia was not eligible to participate. we have reached separate agreements to settle the claims of these states and their participating subdivisions. the distributors also settled the claims of federally recognized native american tribes.
our total estimated liability for opioid-related claims was $7.2 billion as of march 31, 2023, of which $548 million was included in "other accrued liabilities" for the amount estimated to be paid prior to march 31, 2024, and the remaining liability was included in "long-term litigation liabilities" in our consolidated balance sheet.
although the vast majority of opioid claims have been brought by governmental entities in the u.s., the company is also a defendant in cases brought in the u.s. by private plaintiffs, such as hospitals, health and welfare funds, third-party payors, and individuals, as well as four cases brought in canada (three by governmental or tribal entities and one by an individual). these claims, and those of private individuals or entities generally, are not included in the settlement or in the charges recorded by the company, described above. the company believes it has valid legal defenses in these matters and intends to mount a vigorous defense.
because of the many uncertainties associated with ongoing opioid-related litigation matters, we are not able to reasonably estimate the upper or lower ends of the range of ultimate possible loss for all opioid-related litigation matters. in light of the uncertainty, the amount of any ultimate loss may differ materially from the amount accrued.
notwithstanding the settlement, we also continue to prepare for trial in pending matters. we believe that we have valid defenses to the claims pending against us and, absent an acceptable settlement, intend to vigorously defend against all such claims. an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, cash flows or liquidity, or results of operations. refer to financial note 17, "commitments and contingent liabilities," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for more information.
risks and forward-looking information key assumptions and estimates about future performance and values, including those used in our impairment assessments, can be affected by a variety of factors, including the impacts of socio-political events on industry and economic trends, as well as on our business strategy and internal forecasts. recent such events include the covid-19 pandemic and the war between russia and ukraine, and the associated economic impacts, which have disrupted aspects of the global economy over the last several years. we have experienced and may experience difficulties in sourcing products and changes in costs and pricing due to the effects of various socio-political events on supply chains. we periodically review our intangible and other long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. material changes to key assumptions and estimates could decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates that could potentially result in future impairment charges, or otherwise adversely impact our financial position, cash flows or liquidity, or results of operations. refer to item 1a - risk factors in part i of this annual report for a discussion of risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our projections.

revenues revenues increased for the year ended march 31, 2023 compared to the prior year largely due to market growth in our u.s. pharmaceutical segment. market growth includes growing drug utilization, price increases, and newly launched products, partially offset by price deflation associated with branded to generic drug conversion. this revenue growth was partially offset by lower revenues in our international segment driven by the completed divestitures of our u.k. and e.u. disposal groups and our austrian business, and unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations.
gross profit gross profit decreased for the year ended march 31, 2023 compared to the prior year primarily in our international segment driven by the completed divestitures of our u.k. and e.u. disposal groups, our austrian business, and unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, partially offset by growth of specialty pharmaceuticals and increased contributions from our generics programs in our u.s. pharmaceutical segment and an increase in gross profit in our medical-surgical solutions segment from prior year inventory charges on certain ppe and other related products and favorability in our core primary care business. gross profit in fiscal 2023 was also favorably impacted by increased volumes with new and existing customers in our rxts segment.
gross profit for the years ended march 31, 2023 and 2022 included net cash proceeds received of $129 million and $46 million, respectively, representing our share of antitrust legal settlements. gross profit for the year ended march 31, 2023 also included last-in, first-out ("lifo") inventory charges of $1 million and lifo credits of $23 million in 2022. the lifo charges in fiscal 2023 compared to lifo credits in fiscal 2022 are primarily due to higher brand inflation and lower generics deflation, offset by significantly higher off patent launch activity in fiscal 2023. refer to the "critical accounting policies and estimates" section included in this financial review for further information regarding use of the lifo method of accounting within our u.s. pharmaceutical business.
•claims and litigation charges, net: these charges and credits include adjustments for estimated probable settlements related to our controlled substance monitoring and reporting, and opioid-related claims, as well as any applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. legal fees to defend claims, which are expensed as incurred, are included within sdg&a.
•restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net: charges recorded under this component include those incurred for programs in which we change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted, as well as long-lived asset impairments.

total operating expenses and total operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased for the year ended march 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. total operating expenses for the years ended march 31, 2023 and 2022 were affected by the following significant items:
•sdg&a reflects lower operating expenses due to the completed divestitures of our u.k. and e.u. disposal groups in april 2022 and october 2022, respectively;
•sdg&a includes net credits of $66 million associated with the divestiture of our e.u. disposal group in october 2022;
•claims and litigation charges, net was not material. refer to the opioid-related litigation and claims section of the "trends and uncertainties" section above for further discussion;
•restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net primarily includes charges related to corporate expenses, net, as well as our rxts segment. refer to the "restructuring initiatives and long-lived asset impairments" section below as well as financial note 3, "restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for more information; and
•sdg&a includes charges totaling $1.2 billion to remeasure our u.k. disposal group to fair value less costs to sell. the remeasurement adjustment includes a $734 million loss related to the accumulated other comprehensive loss balances associated with the u.k. disposal group, driven by declines in the british pound sterling. of the total charges recorded during the period, $1.1 billion are included within our international segment and $42 million are included within corporate expenses, net;
•sdg&a includes charges of $438 million to remeasure assets and liabilities of our e.u. disposal group held for sale to fair value less costs to sell and to impair certain internal-use software that will not be utilized in the future. the remeasurement adjustment includes a $151 million loss related to the accumulated other comprehensive loss balances associated with the e.u. disposal group, driven by declines in the euro. of the total charges recorded during the period, $383 million are included within our international segment and $55 million are included within corporate expenses, net;
•sdg&a reflects a cost reduction of $142 million related to the cessation of depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets and operating lease right-of-use assets classified as held for sale for our european divestiture disposal groups;
•sdg&a includes opioid-related charges of $130 million, primarily litigation expenses;
•sdg&a includes a gain of $59 million related to the sale of our canadian health benefit claims management and plan administrative services business;
•claims and litigation charges, net includes a charge of $274 million related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims as previously discussed in the "trends and uncertainties" section above;
•restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net includes charges related to corporate expenses, net, as well as our international segment. refer to the "restructuring initiatives and long-lived asset impairments" and "segment operating profit (loss) and corporate expenses, net" sections below as well as financial note 3, "restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for more information; and
goodwill impairments we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and at an interim date if indicators of potential impairment exist. during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we voluntarily changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from october 1st to april 1st to align with the change in timing of our annual long-term planning process. this change was not material to our consolidated financial statements as it did not delay, accelerate, or avoid any potential goodwill impairment charge.
the annual impairment testing performed in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 did not indicate any impairment of goodwill. however, other risks, expenses, and future developments, such as additional government actions, increased regulatory uncertainty, and material changes in key market assumptions limit our ability to estimate projected cash flows, which could adversely affect the fair value of various reporting units in future periods, including our mckesson canada reporting unit within the international segment, where the risk of material goodwill impairment is higher than other reporting units. refer to "critical accounting policies and estimates" included in this financial review for further information. at march 31, 2023 and march 31, 2022, the balance of goodwill in our international segment primarily relates to our mckesson canada reporting unit.
restructuring initiatives and long-lived asset impairments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we approved a broad set of initiatives to drive operational efficiencies and increase cost optimization efforts, with the intent of simplifying our infrastructure and realizing long-term sustainable growth. these initiatives include headcount reductions and the exit or downsizing of certain facilities. we anticipate total charges of approximately $125 million across our rxts and u.s. pharmaceutical segments as well as corporate, consisting primarily of employee severance and other employee-related costs, facility and other exit-related costs, as well as long-lived asset impairments. we recorded charges of $60 million for the year ended march 31, 2023 related to this program, which reflects severance and other employee-related costs within our rxts segment as well as asset impairments and accelerated depreciation, including certain asset impairments primarily within our u.s. pharmaceutical segment and real estate charges within corporate. this restructuring program is anticipated to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2024.
during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we approved an initiative to increase operational efficiencies and flexibility by transitioning to a partial remote work model for certain employees. this initiative primarily included the rationalization of our office space in north america. where we ceased using office space, we exited the portion of the facility no longer used. we also retained and repurposed certain other office locations. we recorded charges of $124 million for the year ended march 31, 2022 primarily related to lease right-of-use and other long-lived asset impairments, lease exit costs, and accelerated depreciation and amortization. this initiative was substantially completed in fiscal 2022 after which immaterial charges will continue to be incurred through the termination date of certain leases.
in fiscal 2022, we recognized charges totaling $36 million to impair certain long-lived assets within our international segment related to our operations in denmark and our retail pharmacy businesses in canada.
•a gain of $142 million related to the exit of one of our investments in equity securities held within our u.s. pharmaceutical segment;
•a gain of $126 million due to the cash received for the early termination of the tra entered into as part of the formation of the joint venture with change, from which mckesson has now exited. this gain was recorded within corporate expenses, net;
•a gain of $97 million from the termination of certain forward starting fixed interest rate swaps within corporate expenses, net; and
these gains were partially offset by net losses of $36 million recognized for the year ended march 31, 2023 compared to net gains of $98 million recognized for the year ended march 31, 2022 from our equity investments held within corporate. these amounts primarily reflect mark-to-market net gains and impairments on certain of our investments in u.s. growth stage companies in the healthcare industry and realized net gains on the exit of some of these investments as further described in financial note 15, "fair value measurements," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. in future periods, fair value adjustments recognized in our operating results for these types of investments may be adversely impacted by market volatility. other income, net for the year ended march 31, 2022 also includes a gain of $42 million related to the sale of our 30% interest in our german pharmaceutical wholesale joint venture with walgreens boots alliance ("wba").
loss on debt extinguishment the loss on debt extinguishment recorded for the year ended march 31, 2022 of $191 million includes premiums of $182 million as well as the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and transaction fees incurred of $9 million, and was driven by our july 2021 tender offer to redeem a portion of our existing debt. refer to financial note 11, "debt and financing activities," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for more information.
interest expense interest expense increased in 2023 compared to the prior year primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of higher interest rates and changes in our derivative portfolio primarily as a result of our european divestiture activities. this was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense driven by lower existing debt due to our tender offer in late july 2021. interest expense may fluctuate based on timing, amounts, and interest rates of term debt repaid and new term debt issued, as well as amounts incurred associated with financing fees.
fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to non-cash charges related to remeasuring the value of our e.u. and u.k. disposal groups held for sale to fair value less costs to sell in fiscal 2022, changes in our business mix of earnings between various taxing jurisdictions, and discrete tax benefits recognized during 2023 and 2022. refer to financial note 6, "income taxes," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for more information.
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and evaluating income tax uncertainties. although our major taxing jurisdictions include the u.s. and canada, we are subject to income taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax liabilities reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. we believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily represents clarusone sourcing services llp, vantage oncology holdings, llc, and the accrual of the annual recurring compensation amount of €0.83 per mckesson europe share that mckesson was obligated to pay to the noncontrolling shareholders of mckesson europe under the december 2014 domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (the "domination agreement") through its divestiture in october 2022. for fiscal 2023, noncontrolling interests also includes the proportionate results of scri oncology from its acquisition date in october 2022. noncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put rights, that are not solely within our control are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests. refer to the "selected measures of liquidity and capital resources" section of this financial review and financial note 7, "redeemable noncontrolling interests and noncontrolling interests," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information on changes to our redeemable and noncontrolling interests that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and the first quarter of 2022.
u.s. pharmaceutical u.s. pharmaceutical revenues for the year ended march 31, 2023 increased $28.5 billion or 13% compared to the prior year. within the segment, sales to pharmacies and institutional healthcare providers increased $27.0 billion and sales to specialty practices and other increased $1.5 billion. overall, these increases were primarily due to market growth, including growth in specialty pharmaceuticals driven by higher volumes from retail national account customers, branded pharmaceutical price increases, and higher volumes from other existing customers. these increases were partially offset by branded to generic drug conversions and decreased distribution of covid-19 vaccines.
prescription technology solutions rxts revenues for the year ended march 31, 2023 increased $523 million or 14% compared to the prior year due to increased volume with new and existing customers primarily in our third-party logistics and wholesale distribution services as well as higher technology service revenues.
medical-surgical solutions medical-surgical solutions revenues for the year ended march 31, 2023 decreased $498 million or 4% compared to the prior year. within the segment, sales to primary care customers decreased $307 million driven by lower sales of covid-19 tests, partially offset by underlying core business growth including higher sales of flu test kits. sales to extended care customers increased $7 million. other sales declined $198 million driven by lower contribution from the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies used to administer covid-19 vaccines.
international international revenues for the year ended march 31, 2023 decreased $15.7 billion or 43% compared to the prior year which included $1.9 billion unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. within the segment, sales in europe declined by $14.8 billion largely due to the completed divestitures of our u.k. and e.u. disposal groups, and austrian business. this was partially offset by increased sales in canada of $1.0 billion largely driven by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes.

•charges of $130 million for the year ended march 31, 2022 of opioid-related costs, primarily litigation expenses; and
u.s. pharmaceutical operating profit increased for the year ended march 31, 2023 compared to the prior year primarily due to growth in specialty pharmaceuticals, increased contributions from our generics programs, a gain recognized from the exit of one of our investments in equity securities in july 2022, and higher cash proceeds received representing our share of antitrust legal settlements. this was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses to support higher volumes, and a decrease in the contribution from our covid-19 vaccine distribution program.
prescription technology solutions operating profit increased for the year ended march 31, 2023 compared to the prior year primarily driven by increased volumes with new and existing customers due to growth in our access, affordability, and adherence solutions.
medical-surgical solutions operating profit increased for the year ended march 31, 2023 compared to the prior year primarily due to favorability in our core primary care business, including favorable illness season testing and sourcing activities, and prior year inventory charges on certain ppe and other related products, partially offset by lower sales of covid-19 tests and a lower contribution from kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for covid-19 vaccines.
international operating profit for this segment for the year ended march 31, 2023 compared to an operating loss for the prior year was primarily a result of higher remeasurement charges recorded in the prior year related to our divestitures of the u.k. and e.u. disposal groups and our austrian business, as well as lower restructuring expenses for optimization programs in canada. this was partially offset by a gain recognized in the prior year from the sale of our canadian health benefit claims management and plan administrative services business.
•year-over-year favorability from lower fair value remeasurement adjustments of our e.u. and u.k. disposal groups compared to fiscal 2022;
•lower charges related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims;
•a gain related to the cash payment received for the early termination of our tra with change;
•a decrease in opioid-related costs, primarily litigation expenses;
•prior year restructuring charges for the transition to a partial remote work model for certain employees; and
these were partially offset by net losses from our equity investments compared to net gains in the prior year period.
foreign operations our foreign operations represented approximately 7% and 14% of our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. foreign operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. refer to item 1a - risk factors in part i of this annual report for a risk factor related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. we conduct our business worldwide in local currencies, including the canadian dollar and, more significantly prior to our european divestiture activities discussed above, euro and british pound sterling. as a result, the comparability of our results reported in u.s. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. in discussing our operating results, we may use the term "foreign currency exchange fluctuations," which refers to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to convert the local currency results of our operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is not the u.s. dollar. we present this information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. in computing the foreign currency exchange fluctuations, we translate our current year results of our operations in foreign countries recorded in local currencies into u.s. dollars by applying their respective average foreign currency exchange rates of the corresponding prior year periods, and we subsequently compare those results to the previously reported results of the comparable prior year periods reported in u.s. dollars.
in july 2021, we announced our intention to exit our businesses in europe. in fiscal 2023, we completed the previously announced sale of our e.u. and u.k. disposal groups and in fiscal 2022 we completed the previously announced sale of our austrian business. refer to financial note 2, "business acquisitions and divestitures," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for more information on these european divestitures.
additional information regarding our foreign operations is also included in financial note 20, "segments of business," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
business combinations refer to financial note 2, "business acquisitions and divestitures," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information.
fiscal 2024 outlook information regarding the company's fiscal 2024 outlook is contained in the release of our fourth quarter fiscal 2023 financial results included as an exhibit to our form 8-k furnished to the sec on may 8, 2023, which is not incorporated by reference into this annual report. that form 8-k should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in the "trends and uncertainties" section of this financial review, as well as the cautionary statements in item 1 - business - forward-looking statements, and item 1a - risk factors, in part i of this annual report.
critical accounting estimates we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters based upon past experience and management's judgment that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. other accounting policies are described in financial note 1, "significant accounting policies," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.
allowances for credit losses: our receivables primarily consist of short-term trade accounts receivable from customers that result from the sale of goods and services. we also provide customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. we also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. we estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts.
the company considers historical credit losses, the current economic environment, customer credit ratings, collections on past due amounts, legal disputes, and bankruptcies, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts to develop its allowance for credit losses. management reviews these factors quarterly to determine if any adjustments are needed to the allowance.
sales to the company's ten largest customers, including group purchasing organizations ("gpos"), accounted for approximately 68% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2023 and comprised approximately 42% of total trade accounts receivable at march 31, 2023. sales to our largest customer, cvs health corporation ("cvs"), accounted for approximately 27% of our total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2023 and comprised approximately 21% of total trade accounts receivable at march 31, 2023. as a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. we also have agreements with gpos, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. the accounts receivable balances are with individual members of the gpos, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. a material default in payment, a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers, or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.
reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business, and market trends. in addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. we believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2023 are appropriate and consistent in the context of historical methodologies employed, as well as assessment of trends currently available.
at march 31, 2023, trade and notes receivables were $17.5 billion prior to allowances of $114 million. our provision for bad debts was $45 million, $29 million, and $4 million in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022, and fiscal 2021, respectively. at march 31, 2023 and 2022, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively. an increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the fiscal 2023 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately $17 million. the selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst-case scenarios. additional information concerning our allowances for credit losses may be found in schedule ii included in this annual report.
inventories: inventories consist of merchandise held for resale. we report inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value, except for inventories determined using the lifo method which are valued at the lower of lifo cost or market. lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold and the inventory cost under lifo approximates market. the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the lifo method. the majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign and certain domestic locations is based on the first-in, first-out ("fifo") method and weighted-average purchase prices. rebates, cash discounts, and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold.
in determining whether an inventory valuation allowance is required, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations, and forecasted sales. shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products, or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. we write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews. these factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results.
at march 31, 2023 and 2022, total inventories, net were $19.7 billion and $18.7 billion, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. the lifo method was used to value approximately 64% and 63% of our inventories at march 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. if we had used the moving average method of inventory valuation, inventories would have been approximately $384 million and $383 million higher than the amounts reported at march 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. these amounts are equivalent to our lifo reserves. a lifo charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. a lifo credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. we recognized a lifo charge of $1 million in fiscal 2023 and lifo credits of $23 million and $38 million in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively, all within "cost of sales" in our consolidated statements of operations. the lifo charge in fiscal 2023 compared to lifo credits in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 are primarily due to higher brand inflation and lower generics deflation, offset by significantly higher off patent launch activity in fiscal 2023. our lifo valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products.
business combinations: we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business, including contingent consideration, as well as any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business, are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date that we obtain control of the acquired business. any purchase consideration in excess of the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred.
several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. for intangible assets, we typically use a variation of the income approach, whereby a forecast of future cash flows attributable to the asset is discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income approach include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows, and the assessment of the asset's expected useful life. refer to financial note 2, "business acquisitions and divestitures," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding our acquisitions.
certain business combinations involve the potential for future payments of consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones or other agreed-upon events. the liability for the contingent consideration is measured at its fair value as of the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. these inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected operational and financial information, the probability of achievement of performance milestones or other agreed-upon events, and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to calculate the present value of the probability-weighted projected financial information. contingent liabilities are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the liability is resolved with changes in fair value being recognized within "selling, distribution, general, and administrative expenses" in the consolidated statements of operations. changes in any of the inputs may result in a significant adjustment to the fair value.
goodwill as a result of acquiring businesses, we have $9.9 billion and $9.5 billion of goodwill at march 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $2.3 billion and $2.1 billion of intangible assets, net at march 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we voluntarily changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from october 1st to april 1st to align with a change in the timing of our annual long-term planning process. this change was not material to our consolidated financial statements as it did not delay, accelerate, or avoid any potential goodwill impairment charge.
we perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the first fiscal quarter and more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. indicators that are considered include significant declines in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the company's stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time.
goodwill impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as an operating segment or a component, one level below our operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit.
we apply the goodwill impairment test by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded equal to the amount of excess carrying value above the estimated fair value, if any, but not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
to estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent within the reporting unit. in addition, we compare the aggregate of the reporting units' fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the reasonableness of our concluded fair values.
estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. the valuations are based on information available as of the impairment testing date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. any material changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, negative changes in government reimbursement rates, deterioration in the u.s. and global financial markets, an increase in interest rates, or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry, or other unanticipated events and circumstances may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. under the market approach, significant estimates and assumptions also include the selection of appropriate guideline public companies and the determination of appropriate valuation multiples to apply to the reporting unit. under the income approach, significant estimates and assumptions also include the determination of discount rates. the discount rates represent the weighted-average cost of capital measuring the reporting unit's cost of debt and equity financing, which are weighted by the percentage of debt and percentage of equity in a company's target capital structure. included in the estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital is the assumption of an unsystematic risk premium to address incremental uncertainty related to the reporting units' future cash flow projections.
the annual impairment testing performed for fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022, and fiscal 2021 did not indicate any impairment of goodwill. the segment change in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 prompted changes in multiple reporting units across the company and as a result, goodwill included in impacted reporting units was reallocated using a relative fair value approach and assessed for impairment both before and after the reallocation. we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $69 million in fiscal 2021 as the estimated fair value of the europe retail pharmacy reporting unit was lower than its reassigned carrying value based on changes in the composition of the europe retail pharmacy reporting unit within the international segment. at march 31, 2023 and 2022, the balance of goodwill in the international segment primarily relates to our mckesson canada reporting unit.
the estimated fair value of our mckesson canada reporting unit in our international segment exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by approximately 30% in fiscal 2023. the goodwill balance of this reporting unit was $1.4 billion at march 31, 2023, or approximately 14% of the consolidated goodwill balance. a decline in estimated future cash flows in excess of approximately 22% for mckesson canada or an increase in the discount rate in excess of approximately 2% could result in an indication of goodwill impairment for this reporting unit in future reporting periods under the income approach. other risks, expenses, and future developments, such as additional government actions, increased regulatory uncertainty, and material changes in key market assumptions may require us to further revise the projected cash flows, which could adversely affect the fair value of our other reporting units in future periods. refer to financial note 10, "goodwill and intangible assets, net," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information.
long-lived assets currently, all of our intangible and other long-lived assets are amortized or depreciated based on the pattern of their economic consumption or a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to 25 years. we review intangible and other long-lived assets for impairment at an asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. determination of recoverability of intangible and other long-lived assets is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset group over its fair value. assumptions and estimates about future values and the remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. they can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.
our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in further impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. refer to financial note 3, "restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information on our long-lived asset impairments.
long-lived assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are not depreciated or amortized. fair value is determined based on the total consideration expected to be received by the company. the fair value of a disposal group, less any costs to sell, is assessed each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and any remeasurement to the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell is reported as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group. when the net realizable value of a disposal group increases during a period, a gain can be recognized to the extent that it does not increase the value of the disposal group beyond its original carrying value when the disposal group was reclassified as held for sale.
restructuring charges: we have certain restructuring reserves which require significant estimates related to the timing and amount of future employee severance and other exit-related costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place. we generally recognize employee severance costs when payments are probable and amounts are estimable. costs related to contracts without future benefit or contract termination are recognized at the earlier of the contract termination or the cease-use dates. other exit-related costs are recognized as incurred. in connection with these restructuring actions, we also assess the recoverability of long-lived assets used in the business, and as a result, we may recognize accelerated depreciation and amortization reflecting shortened useful lives of the underlying assets.
income taxes: our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties, including those used to conclude on the tax-free nature of the separation of the change healthcare jv and the unrecognized tax position related to opioid-related litigation and claims, and may differ from the actual amounts of tax benefit recognized. we review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. in estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state, and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. should tax laws change, our tax expense and cash flows could be materially impacted.
in addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex new tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations.
we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the u.s. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized. refer to financial note 6, "income taxes," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information on income tax matters.
loss contingencies: we are subject to various claims, including claims with customers and vendors, pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. however, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict, and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. when a material loss is reasonably possible or probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. legal fees are recognized as incurred when the legal services are provided.
we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of the loss can be made. as discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on future negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system, and other interested parties.
in conjunction with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, we considered matters related to ongoing controlled substances claims to which we are a party. at march 31, 2023, our estimated accrued liability for the opioid-related claims of governmental entities was $7.2 billion. because of the many uncertainties associated with the remaining opioid-related litigation matters, we are not able to reasonably estimate the upper or lower ends of the range of ultimate possible losses for all opioid-related litigation matters. we are not able to predict the outcome in these matters, and an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows or liquidity. refer to the "opioid-related litigation and claims" section of the "trends and uncertainties" section of this financial review and financial note 17, "commitments and contingent liabilities," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information.
financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources we expect our available cash generated from operations and our short-term investment portfolio, together with our existing sources of liquidity through access to the debt market generally and from our credit facilities and commercial paper program, will be sufficient to fund our short-term and long-term capital expenditures, working capital, and other cash requirements. we remain well-capitalized with access to liquidity from our $4.0 billion 2022 credit facility. at march 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all debt covenants, and believe we have the ability to continue to meet our debt covenants in the future.

(1)the fiscal 2023 change reflects a reversal of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash previously classified within assets held for sale at march 31, 2022 as part of the u.k. disposal group and is offset by cash outflows primarily related to the settlement of liabilities which is reflected in operating activities. refer to financial note 2, "business acquisitions and divestitures," to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further information.
operating activities operating activities provided cash of $5.2 billion and $4.4 billion for the years ended march 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers, inventory receipts, and payments to vendors. additionally, working capital is primarily a function of sales and purchase volumes, inventory requirements, and vendor payment terms.
operating activities for the year ended march 31, 2023 were affected by net income of $3.7 billion adjusted for non-cash items, and an increase in drafts and accounts payable of $3.8 billion offset by increases in inventories and receivables of $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, were primarily driven by higher revenues and timing. our litigation liabilities decreased by $1.1 billion due to payments made during fiscal 2023 associated with the settlement and separate settlement agreements of opioid-related claims of participating states, subdivisions, and native american tribes. other non-cash items within operating activities for the year ended march 31, 2023 includes stock-based compensation of $162 million.
operating activities for the year ended march 31, 2022 were affected by net income adjusted for non-cash items, including the losses on our european businesses held for sale and our classifications of receivables, drafts and accounts payables, and inventories as held for sale. refer to financial note 2, "business acquisitions and divestitures," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further information. excluding the aforementioned classifications, operating activities for the year ended march 31, 2022 were affected by increases in inventory of $1.2 billion and drafts and accounts payable of $2.8 billion due to timing of purchases, and an increase in receivables of $1.8 billion resulting from timing of collections and higher revenues. other non-cash items within operating activities for the year ended march 31, 2022 includes an adjustment to net income of $191 million related to loss on debt extinguishment, non-cash inventory charges totaling $164 million on certain ppe and other related products in our medical-surgical solutions segment, and stock-based compensation of $161 million.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $542 million and $89 million for the years ended march 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. investing activities for the year ended march 31, 2023 includes $867 million of net cash payments for acquisitions, including $600 million for our acquisition of rxss and $173 million for our formation of scri oncology with hca. investing activities for the year ended march 31, 2023 also includes $390 million and $168 million in capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment and capitalized software, respectively, and reflects proceeds from sales of businesses and investments of $1.1 billion, including cash proceeds, net of cash divested, of $573 million from the completed divestiture of our e.u. disposal group, $202 million of net cash from the completed divestiture of our u.k. disposal group, and $179 million of cash from the exit of one of our investments in equity securities in july 2022.
investing activities for the year ended march 31, 2022 includes $388 million and $147 million in capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment and capitalized software, respectively. investing activities for the year ended march 31, 2022 also includes net cash proceeds of $578 million from sales of businesses and investments, primarily driven by our european divestiture activities described above, including the disposal of our austria business, and the sale of certain of our equity investments.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $4.4 billion and $6.3 billion for the years ended march 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. financing activities for the year ended march 31, 2023 includes $3.6 billion of cash paid for share repurchases and $292 million of cash paid for dividends. financing activities also includes cash receipts of $8.5 billion and payments of $8.5 billion for short-term borrowings of commercial paper in fiscal 2023. in november 2022, we entered into the 2022 term loan credit facility which provided an unsecured term loan facility of up to $500 million, which we drew upon in full in december 2022 and which we subsequently repaid in february 2023. the proceeds of this loan were used for general corporate purposes. in february 2023, we completed a public offering of the 5.25% notes with net proceeds of $497 million, which were used to repay existing debt. in december 2022, we retired our $400 million outstanding principal amount of the 2.70% notes and on march 15, 2023, we retired our $360 million outstanding principal amount of the 2.85% notes, both upon maturity using cash on hand. cash used for other financing activities generally includes shares surrendered for tax withholding and payments to noncontrolling interests.
financing activities for the year ended march 31, 2022 includes cash receipts of $11.2 billion and payments of $11.2 billion from short-term borrowings of commercial paper. financing activities for the year ended march 31, 2022 includes a cash tender offer of $1.1 billion to redeem certain notes with a principal amount of $922 million and the redemption of our 0.63% euro-denominated notes with a principal amount of €600 million (or, approximately $709 million) prior to the maturity date of august 17, 2021 using cash on hand. this resulted in total repayments of long-term debt during the year ended march 31, 2022 of $1.8 billion, including $184 million of cash paid for premiums and transaction fees. this was partially offset by the issuance of long-term debt in august 2021 pursuant to a public offering of 1.30% notes due 2026 for net proceeds of $498 million, which was utilized for general corporate purposes. financing activities for the year ended march 31, 2022 also includes $3.5 billion of cash paid for share repurchases and $277 million of cash paid for dividends. additionally, financing activities for the year ended march 31, 2022 includes payments of $1.0 billion to purchase shares of mckesson europe through exercises of a put right option by noncontrolling shareholders. cash used for other financing activities for the year ended march 31, 2022 includes payments to noncontrolling interests, and funds temporarily held on behalf of unaffiliated medical practice groups.
share repurchase plans the board has authorized the repurchase of mckesson's common stock from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase ("asr") programs, or by combinations of such methods, any of which may use pre-arranged trading plans that are designed to meet the requirements of rule 10b5-1(c) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. the timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, tax implications, restrictions under our debt obligations, and other market and economic conditions. during the last two years, our share repurchases were transacted through both open market transactions and asr programs with third-party financial institutions. the asr programs discussed below were designed to comply with rule 10b5-1(c).
information regarding the share repurchase activity over the last two fiscal years was as follows:
(1)this table does not include the value of equity awards surrendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations or forfeitures of equity awards.
(3)in february 2022, we entered into an asr program with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.5 billion of the company's common stock. the total number of shares repurchased under this asr program was 5.1 million shares at an average price per share of $295.16. we received 4.8 million shares as the initial share settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 based on an initial share purchase price, and in may 2022, we received an additional 0.3 million shares upon the completion of this asr program.
(4)of the total dollar value, $27 million was accrued within "other accrued liabilities" in our consolidated balance sheet as of march 31, 2023 for share repurchases that were executed in late march 2023 and settled in early april 2023.
we believe that our future operating cash flow, financial assets, and current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. however, there can be no assurance that an increase in volatility or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.
selected measures of liquidity and capital resources march 31,
working capital                                      (3,665)                             (2,235)
debt to capital ratio (2)                              120.5      %                        114.5           %
(2)this ratio describes the relationship and changes within our capital resources, and is computed as the sum of total debt divided by the sum of total debt and mckesson stockholders' deficit, which excludes noncontrolling interests and accumulated other comprehensive loss.
cash equivalents, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are carried at fair value. cash equivalents are primarily invested in aaa-rated u.s. government money market funds, short-term deposits with financial institutions, and short-term commercial papers issued by non-financial institutions. deposits with financial institutions are primarily denominated in u.s. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including canadian dollars, euro, and british pounds sterling. deposits could exceed the amounts insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation in the u.s. and similar deposit insurance programs in other jurisdictions. we mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds.
our cash and cash equivalents balance as of march 31, 2023 and 2022 included approximately $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the u.s., respectively. our primary intent is to utilize this cash for foreign operations for an indefinite period of time. although the vast majority of cash held outside the u.s. is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes. we may remit foreign earnings to the u.s. to the extent it is tax efficient to do so. we do not expect the tax impact from remitting these earnings to be material. following enactment of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act, the repatriation of cash to the u.s. is generally no longer taxable for federal income tax purposes.
working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and inventories, net of drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, and other accrued liabilities. working capital also includes net assets and liabilities classified as held for sale which have decreased in fiscal 2023 as a result of the divestiture of our e.u. and u.k. disposal groups. our businesses require substantial investments in working capital that are susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements.
consolidated working capital decreased at march 31, 2023 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in drafts and accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents, inventory and receivables, driven by higher revenues and timing.
our debt to capital ratio increased for the year ended march 31, 2023 primarily due to share repurchases and net repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by net income attributable to mckesson for the year.
in july 2022, we raised our quarterly dividend from $0.47 to $0.54 per common share for dividends declared on or after such date by the board. dividends were $2.09 per share in fiscal 2023 and $1.83 per share in fiscal 2022. we anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. however, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the board and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors. in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, we paid total cash dividends of $292 million and $277 million, respectively.
the put right expired on june 15, 2021, at which point the remaining shares owned by the minority shareholders, valued at $287 million, were transferred from redeemable noncontrolling interests to noncontrolling interests and as a result, we no longer have redeemable noncontrolling interests presented in our consolidated balance sheets at march 31, 2023 or 2022. our noncontrolling interest in mckesson europe was included in the sale of our e.u. disposal group in october 2022, as discussed in more detail in financial note 2, "business acquisitions and divestitures."
additionally, prior to the sale of our e.u. disposal group in october 2022, we were obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation of €0.83 per mckesson europe share (the "compensation amount") to the noncontrolling shareholders of mckesson europe under the domination agreement. the compensation amount was recognized ratably during the applicable annual period through the october 31, 2022 divestiture. the domination agreement did not expire, but it may be terminated at the end of any fiscal year by giving at least six months' advance notice.
refer to financial note 7, "redeemable noncontrolling interests and noncontrolling interests," to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding redeemable noncontrolling interests.

(5)primarily relates to the expected purchase of goods and services, including inventory and capital commitments, from vendors in the normal course of business.
(6)includes agreements under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of our customers' inventory and our customers' debt in the event these customers are unable to meet their obligations to those financial institutions. refer to financial note 16, "financial guarantees and warranties," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for more information.
at march 31, 2023, the company had accrued liabilities of $7.2 billion related to the settlement of opioid-related litigation claims with u.s. governmental entities, including native american tribes, as described in the "trends and uncertainties" section of this financial review and financial note 17, "commitments and contingent liabilities," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. the majority of this amount relates to a global settlement payable in annual installments through 2038 pursuant to the schedule set forth in the agreement. as of march 31, 2023, $548 million is estimated to be paid within the next twelve months.
at march 31, 2023, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, excluding associated interest and penalties, was approximately $974 million. the ultimate amount and timing of any related future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty. refer to financial note 6, "income taxes," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information on income tax matters.
at march 31, 2023, our banks and insurance companies have issued $206 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds. these were issued on our behalf and are mostly related to our customer contracts and to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations, pension obligations in europe, and our workers' compensation and automotive liability programs.
credit resources we fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term borrowings from our commercial paper issuances. funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements, including any future payments that may be made related to our total estimated litigation liability of $7.2 billion as of march 31, 2023 payable under the terms of various settlement agreements for opioid-related claims, are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources, and other capital market transactions. long-term debt markets and commercial paper markets, our primary sources of capital after cash flow from operations, are open and accessible to us should we decide to access those markets. detailed information regarding our debt and financing activities is included in financial note 11, "debt and financing activities," to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.

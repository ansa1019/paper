item 7.       management's discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)
the following management's discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of newmont corporation, a delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries (collectively, "newmont," the "company," "our" and "we"). we use certain non-gaap financial measures in our md&a. for a detailed description of each of the non-gaap measures used in this md&a, please refer to the discussion under non-gaap financial measures. this item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report.
the following md&a generally discusses our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for 2022 and 2021 and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. discussions of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for 2020 and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 are included in item 7, management's discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations, in the company's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2021, filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 24, 2022.
overview newmont is the world's leading gold company and is the only gold company included in the s&p 500 index and the fortune 500 list of companies. we have been included in the dow jones sustainability index-world since 2007 and have adopted the world gold council's conflict-free gold policy. since 2015, newmont has been ranked as the mining and metal sector's top gold miner by the s&p global corporate sustainability assessment. newmont has been ranked the top miner in 3bl media's 100 best corporate citizens list which ranks the 1,000 largest publicly traded u.s. companies on esg transparency and performance since 2020. we are primarily engaged in the exploration for and acquisition of gold properties, some of which may contain copper, silver, lead, zinc or other metals. we have significant operations and/or assets in the u.s., canada, mexico, dominican republic, peru, suriname, argentina, chile, australia and ghana. our goal is to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining.
refer to the consolidated financial results, results of consolidated operations, liquidity and capital resources and non-gaap financial measures for information about the continued impacts from the covid-19 pandemic, the russian invasion of ukraine, and the resulting significant inflation experienced globally, as well as the effects of certain counter measures taken by central banks, on the company. also refer to discussion of risk and uncertainties within note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, relating to inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, with particular consideration on the outlook for increased costs specific to labor, materials, consumables and fuel and energy on operations, as well as impacts on the timing and cost of capital expenditures and the risk of potential impairment to certain assets.
in the third quarter of 2022, as a result of these challenging market conditions, record inflation rates, the rising prices for commodities and raw materials, prolonged supply chain disruptions, competitive labor markets and consideration of capital allocation, the company announced the delay of the full-funds investment decision for the yanacocha sulfides project in peru. with the delay of the yanacocha sulfides project, management will focus its efforts on optimizing its allocation of funds to current operations and other capital commitments, while also assessing execution options and project plans options, up to and including transitioning yanacocha operations into full closure. refer to note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion in the first quarter of 2022, the company completed the acquisition of buenaventura's 43.65% noncontrolling interest in minera yanacocha s.r.l. ("yanacocha") (the "yanacocha transaction") and sold its 46.94% ownership interest in minera la zanja s.r.l. ("la zanja"). the company acquired the remaining 5% interest previously held by sumitomo in the second quarter of 2022. at december 31, 2022, the company holds 100% ownership interest in yanacocha. refer to note 1 of the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding these transactions.
for information on asset sales impacting comparability of below results, refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
the decrease in net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to newmont stockholders during the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, is primarily due to higher impairment charges resulting from impairment of goodwill at cerro negro and porcupine and impairment of long-lived assets at cc&v, higher costs applicable to sales predominately resulting from cost inflation impacts and $70 related to the profit-sharing agreement entered into by the company in 2022 at peñasquito (the "peñasquito profit-sharing agreement") related to 2021 site performance, and lower sales volumes for all metals except copper, partially offset by lower reclamation and remediation, lower income tax expense, and the loss on assets held for sale in 2021 related to the conga mill assets. for additional information, refer to the notes of the consolidated financial statements.
the details and analyses of our sales for all periods presented are set forth below. refer to note 4 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
for discussion regarding drivers impacting sales volumes by site, refer to results of consolidated operations below.
the details of our costs applicable to sales are set forth below. refer to note 3 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the increase in costs applicable to sales during the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, is primarily due to (i) impacts from cost inflation due to higher input commodity prices, notably fuel and energy costs, and increased labor costs (ii) higher inventory adjustments primarily at ngm, yanacocha, cc&v, and akyem (iii) the peñasquito profit-sharing agreement and (iv) lower by-product credits, partially offset by lower sales volumes.
for discussion regarding other significant drivers impacting costs applicable to sales by site, refer to results of consolidated operations below.
the details of our depreciation and amortization are set forth below. refer to note 3 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the decrease in depreciation and amortization during the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, is primarily due to the ramp down of mining at ngm for long canyon and lower production volumes at peñasquito and éléonore as a result of lower ore grade mined and at ngm as a result of lower leach pad production and ore grade mined, partially offset by higher production at ahafo, akyem, and boddington as a result of higher ore grade milled.
for discussion regarding other significant drivers impacting depreciation and amortization by site, refer to results of consolidated operations below.
advanced projects, research and development expense was $229, $154 and $122 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. advanced projects, research and development expense increased in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to payments made as part of the strategic alliance with caterpillar inc. ("cat") relating to the company's climate change initiatives and project spend relating to certain development projects at cerro negro in south america and galore creek in corporate and other. advanced projects, research and development expense includes development project management costs, feasibility studies and other project expenses that do not qualify for capitalization.
interest expense, net was $227, $274 and $308 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. capitalized interest totaled $69, $38, and $24 in each year, respectively. interest expense, net decreased in 2022, compared to 2021, as a result of the repayment of debt in 2021 and 2022 and higher capitalization of interest.
income and mining tax expense (benefit) was $455, $1,098, and $704 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. the effective tax rate is driven by a number of factors and the comparability of our income tax expense for the reported periods will be primarily affected by (i) variations in our income before income taxes; (ii) geographic distribution of that income; (iii) impacts of the changes in tax law; (iv) valuation allowances on tax assets; (v) percentage depletion; (vi) fluctuation in the value of the united states dollar and foreign currencies; and (vii) the impact of specific transactions and assessments including a significant impairment of goodwill during 2022. as a result, the effective tax rate will fluctuate, sometimes significantly, year to year. this trend is expected to continue in future periods. refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes.

(3)includes tax benefit of $(125) and $-, respectively related to a tax settlement.
(5)includes $16 of withholding tax.
in august 2022, the u.s. government enacted the inflation reduction act of 2022 (the "ira") into law. the ira introduced an excise tax on stock repurchases of 1% and a corporate alternative minimum tax (the "corporate amt") of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income ("afsi") of corporations with average afsi exceeding $1 billion over a three-year period. the ira is effective for fiscal periods beginning 2023. while waiting on pending department of treasury regulatory guidance, we are continuing to monitor developments. based upon information known to date, no material impacts are expected to the consolidated financial statements, disclosures, or cash flows. refer to note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for further information.

foreign currency exchange rates our foreign operations sell their gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc production based on usd metal prices. therefore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates do not have a material impact on our revenue. despite selling gold and silver in london, we have no exposure to the euro or the british pound.
foreign currency exchange rates can increase or decrease profits to the extent costs are paid in foreign currencies, including the australian dollar, the mexican peso, the canadian dollar, the argentine peso, the peruvian sol, the surinamese dollar and the ghanaian cedi. in 2022, approximately 49% of costs applicable to sales were paid in currencies other than the u.s. dollar as follows:
our cerro negro mine, located in argentina, is a usd functional currency entity. argentina has a hyperinflationary economy with a cumulative inflation rate of over 216% for the last three years. in recent years, argentina's central bank enacted a number of foreign currency controls in an effort to stabilize the local currency, including requiring the company to convert usd proceeds from metal sales to local currency within 60 days from shipment date or five business days from receipt of cash, whichever happens first, as well as restricting payments to foreign-related entities denominated in foreign currency, such as dividends or distributions to the parent and related companies and royalties and other payments to foreign beneficiaries. these restrictions directly impact cerro negro's ability to pay principal portions of intercompany debt to the company. we continue to monitor the foreign currency exposure risk and the limitations of repatriating cash to the u.s. currently, these currency controls are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.
our merian mine, located in the country of suriname, is a usd functional currency entity. suriname has experienced significant inflation over the last three years and has a highly inflationary economy. in 2021, the central bank took steps to stabilize the local currency, while the government introduced new legislation to narrow the gap between government revenues and spending. the measures to increase government revenue mainly consist of tax increases; however, newmont and the republic of suriname have a mineral agreement in place that supersedes such measures. the central bank of suriname adopted a controlled floating rate system, which resulted in a concurrent devaluation of the surinamese dollar. the majority of merian's activity has historically been denominated in usd; as a result, the devaluation of the surinamese dollar has resulted in an immaterial impact on our financial statements. therefore, future devaluation of the surinamese dollar is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity overview we have a disciplined cash allocation strategy of maintaining financial flexibility to execute our capital priorities and generate long-term value for our shareholders. consistent with that strategy, we aim to self-fund development projects and make strategic partnerships focused on profitable growth, while reducing our debt and returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.
the continued impacts from the covid-19 pandemic, the russian invasion of ukraine, and the resulting significant inflation experienced globally, as well as the effects of certain countermeasures taken by central banks, have been and are expected to continue to adversely affect the company. depending on the duration and extent of the impact of these events, commodity prices and the prices for gold and other metals could continue to experience volatility; transportation industry disruptions could continue, including limitations on shipping produced metals; our supply chain could continue to experience disruption; cost inflation rates could further increase; or we could incur credit related losses of certain financial assets, which could materially impact the company's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. as of december 31, 2022, we believe our available liquidity allows us to manage the short- and, possibly, long-term material adverse impacts of these events on our business. refer to note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on risks and uncertainties.
at december 31, 2022, the company had $2,877 in cash and cash equivalents. the majority of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in a variety of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. during the third quarter of 2022, the company began investing in time deposits with a maturity of more than three months but less than one year, and at december 31, 2022 the company had $829 of these time deposits, which are included in time deposits and other investments. our cash and cash equivalents and time deposits are highly liquid and low-risk investments that are able to fund our operations as necessary. we may have investments in prime money market funds that are classified as cash and cash equivalents; however, we continually monitor the need for reclassification under the sec requirements for money market funds, and the potential that the shares of such funds could have a net asset value less than their par value. we believe that our liquidity and capital resources are adequate to fund our operations and corporate activities.
at december 31, 2022, $907 of cash and cash equivalents was held in foreign subsidiaries and is primarily held in u.s. dollar denominated accounts with the remainder in foreign currencies readily convertible to usd. cash and cash equivalents denominated in argentine peso are subject to regulatory restrictions. refer to foreign currency exchange rates above for further information. at december 31, 2022, $658 in consolidated cash and cash equivalents was held at certain foreign subsidiaries that, if repatriated, may be subject to withholding taxes. we expect that there would be no additional tax burden upon repatriation after considering the cash cost associated with any potential withholding taxes.
we believe our existing consolidated cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, available capacity on our revolving credit facility, and cash generated from continuing operations will be adequate to satisfy working capital needs, fund future growth, meet debt obligations and meet other liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. at december 31, 2022, our borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility was $3,000, and we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. we continue to remain compliant with covenants and do not currently anticipate any events or circumstances that would impact our ability to access funds available on this facility. refer to note 20 of the consolidated financial statements for further information on our debt.
our financial position was as follows:
time deposits (1)                                               829                       -

(2)net debt is a non-gaap financial measure used by management to evaluate financial flexibility and strength of the company's balance sheet. refer to non-gaap financial measures below.
cash flows net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of continuing operations was $3,198 in 2022, a decrease in cash provided of $1,068 from the year ended december 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in operating cash expenditures resulting from the impacts of cost inflation due to higher input commodity prices, notably fuel and energy costs, and increased labor costs; lower sales volumes, and payments related to: (i) increased reclamation and remediation obligations, (ii) the peñasquito profit-sharing agreement, (iii) previously accrued employee severance resulting from a recent employment model change in ghana, and (iv) our strategic alliance with cat.
net cash provided by (used in) investing activities of continuing operations was $(2,983) in 2022, an increase in cash used of $1,115 from the year ended december 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in the purchase of time deposits and higher capital expenditures in 2022, partially offset by the acquisition of gt gold in 2021.
net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(2,356) in 2022, a decrease in cash used of $602 from the year ended december 31, 2021, primarily due to higher stock repurchases in 2021 and higher net repayments of debt in 2021, partially offset by the acquisition of non-controlling interest in yanacocha in 2022.
capital resources in february 2023, the board declared a dividend of $0.40 per share, determined under the dividend framework. this framework is non-binding and is periodically reviewed and reassessed by the board of directors. the declaration and payment of future dividends remains at the full discretion of the board and will depend on the company's financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the board.
capital expenditures cash generated from operations is used to execute our capital priorities, which include sustaining and developing our global portfolio of long-lived assets. our near-term development capital projects include tanami expansion 2 and ahafo north, which are being funded from existing liquidity and will continue to be funded from future operating cash flows. capital costs are estimated to be between $1,200 and $1,300 for tanami expansion 2 and between $950 and $1,050 for ahafo north, with the first full year of commercial production expected to be 2026 for both projects.
we consider sustaining capital as those capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. capital expenditures to develop new operations or related to projects at existing operations, where these projects will enhance production or reserves, are considered non-sustaining or development capital. the company's decision to reprioritize, sell or abandon a development project, which may include returning mining concessions to host governments, could result in a future impairment charge.
the company continues to evaluate strategic priorities and deployment of capital to projects in the pipeline to ensure we execute on our capital priorities and provide long-term value to shareholders. included in the company's continuous evaluation is consideration of current market opportunities or pressures. in response to the current challenging market conditions, which include inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, in the third quarter of 2022 the company announced the delay of the full-funds investment decision for the yanacocha sulfides project in peru. refer to note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for further information.
in 2020, we announced climate targets to reduce ghg emissions and plans to invest in climate change initiatives in support of this goal, which may be capital in nature. as part of these initiatives, in november 2021, newmont announced a strategic alliance with cat with the aim to develop and implement a comprehensive all-electric autonomous mining system to achieve zero emissions mining. to support this alliance, newmont pledged a preliminary investment of $100, of which $39 has been paid as of december 31, 2022 and is recognized in advanced projects, research and development within our consolidated statements of operations, to cat in connection with automation and electrification goals for surface and underground mining infrastructures and haulage fleets. the remaining pledged amount is anticipated to be paid as certain milestones are reached through 2025.
other investments supporting our climate change initiatives are expected to include emissions reduction projects and renewable energy opportunities as we seek to achieve these climate targets. for risks related to climate-related capital expenditures, refer to part i, item 1a risk factors.

environmental our mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. we have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. we perform a comprehensive review of our reclamation and remediation liabilities annually and review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. notably, newmont is committed to the implementation of gistm and all tailing storage facilities are expected to be in conformance with the gistm by 2025. compliance with gistm remains on-going and has and may continue to result in further increases to our estimated sustaining costs and closure costs for existing operations and non-operating sites. additionally, laws, regulations and permit requirements focused on water management and discharge requirements for operations and water treatment in connection with closure are becoming increasingly stringent. compliance with water management and discharge quality remains dynamic and has and may continue to result in further increases to our estimated closure costs.
at december 31, 2022 and 2021, $6,731 and $5,768, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently or recently producing or development stage mineral properties, of which $482 and $213, respectively, were classified as current liabilities.
in addition, we are involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining activities. based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $373 and $344 were accrued for such obligations at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of which $44 and $60, respectively, were classified as current liabilities. we spent $56, $43 and $25 during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, for environmental obligations related to the former mining activities.
reclamation and remediation adjustments during 2022 primarily related to (i) increased water management costs at portions of our yanacocha and porcupine site operations that are no longer in production and with no expected substantive future economic value (i.e., non-operating) (ii) increased costs due to closure plan design changes at our porcupine site operations (iii) higher waste disposal costs and project execution delays at the midnite mine and dawn mill sites and (iv) higher estimated closure costs due to cost inflation. reclamation and remediation adjustments during 2021 primarily related to (i) increased water treatment costs at non-
operating portions of our yanacocha site operation and (ii) higher estimated closure costs at various other non-operating sites arising from recent tailings management review and monitoring requirements set forth by gistm.
during the year ended 2022, 2021, and 2020, capital expenditures were approximately $29, $13, and $23, respectively, to comply with environmental regulations.

free cash flow management uses free cash flow as a non-gaap measure to analyze cash flows generated from operations. free cash flow is net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of discontinued operations less additions to property, plant and mine development as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows. the company believes free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing the company's performance with its competitors. although free cash flow and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies, the company's calculation of free cash flow is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies.
the presentation of non-gaap free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company's performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity as those terms are defined by gaap, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. the company's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. therefore, the company believes it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to the company's consolidated statements of cash flows.
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-gaap financial measure, to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, which the company believes to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash provided by (used in) investing activities and net cash provided by (used in) financing activities.

net debt management uses net debt to measure the company's liquidity and financial position. net debt is calculated as debt and lease and other financing obligations less cash and cash equivalents and time deposits included in time deposits and other investments, as presented on the consolidated balance sheets. cash and cash equivalents and time deposits are subtracted from debt and lease and other financing obligations as these are highly liquid, low-risk investments and could be used to reduce the company's debt obligations. the company believes the use of net debt allows investors and others to evaluate financial flexibility and strength of the company's balance sheet. net debt is intended to provide additional information only and does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of liquidity prepared in accordance with gaap. other companies may calculate this measure differently.

costs applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce costs applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce are non-gaap financial measures. these measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales of gold and other metals by gold ounces or gold equivalent ounces sold, respectively. these measures are calculated for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. we believe that these measures provide additional information to management, investors and others that aids in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and provides investors visibility into the direct and indirect costs related to production, excluding depreciation and amortization, on a per ounce/gold equivalent ounce basis. costs applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap. the measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap. other companies may calculate these measures differently.

all-in sustaining costs current gaap measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain production. therefore, newmont calculates all-in sustaining costs ("aisc") based on the definition published by the world gold council. the world gold council is a market development organization for the gold industry comprised of and funded by gold mining companies around the world and a regulatory organization.
aisc is a metric that expands on gaap measures, such as cost of goods sold, and non-gaap measures, such as costs applicable to sales per ounce, to provide visibility into the economics of our mining operations related to expenditures, operating performance and the ability to generate cash flow from our continuing operations. we believe that aisc is a non-gaap measure that provides additional information to management, investors and others that aids in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and provides investors visibility by better defining the total costs associated with production.
aisc amounts are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap. the measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap. other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks such as in ifrs, or by reflecting the benefit from selling non-gold metals as a reduction to aisc. differences may also arise related to definitional differences of sustaining versus development (i.e. non-sustaining) activities based upon each company's internal policies.
costs applicable to sales. includes all direct and indirect costs related to current production incurred to execute the current mine plan. we exclude certain exceptional or unusual amounts from cas, such as significant revisions to recovery amounts. cas includes by-product credits from certain metals obtained during the process of extracting and processing the primary ore-body. cas is accounted for on an accrual basis and excludes depreciation and amortization and reclamation and remediation, which is consistent with our presentation of cas on the consolidated statements of operations. in determining aisc, only the cas associated with producing and selling an ounce of gold is included in the measure. therefore, the amount of gold cas included in aisc is derived from the cas presented in the company's consolidated statements of operations less the amount of cas attributable to the production of other metals. the other metals' cas at those mine sites is disclosed in note 3 of the consolidated financial statements. the allocation of cas between gold and other metals is based upon the relative sales value of gold and other metals produced during the period.
reclamation costs. includes accretion expense related to reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the related arc for the company's operating properties. accretion related to the reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the arc assets for reclamation does not reflect annual cash outflows but are calculated in accordance with gaap. the accretion and amortization reflect the periodic costs of reclamation associated with current production and are therefore included in the measure. the allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of cas between gold and other metals.
advanced projects, research and development and exploration. includes incurred expenses related to projects that are designed to sustain current production and exploration. we note that as current resources are depleted, exploration and advanced projects are necessary for us to replace the depleting reserves or enhance the recovery and processing of the current reserves to sustain production at existing operations. as these costs relate to sustaining our production, and are considered a continuing cost of a mining company, these costs are included in the aisc measure. these costs are derived from the advanced projects, research and development and exploration amounts presented in the consolidated statements of operations less incurred expenses related to the development of new operations, or related to major projects at existing operations where these projects will materially benefit the operation in the future. the allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of cas between gold and other metals. we also allocate these costs incurred at the other north america, other australia and corporate and other locations using the proportion of cas between gold and other metals.
general and administrative. includes costs related to administrative tasks not directly related to current production, but rather related to supporting our corporate structure and fulfilling our obligations to operate as a public company. including these expenses in the aisc metric provides visibility of the impact that general and administrative activities have on current operations and profitability on a per ounce basis. we allocate these costs to gold and other metals at the other north america, other australia and corporate and other locations using the proportion of cas between gold and other metals.
other expense, net. for other expense, net we include care and maintenance costs relating to direct operating costs incurred at the mine sites during the period that these sites were temporarily placed into care and maintenance in response to the covid-19 pandemic and exclude certain exceptional or unusual expenses, such as restructuring, as these are not indicative to sustaining our current operations. furthermore, this adjustment to other expense, net is also consistent with the nature of the adjustments made to net income (loss) attributable to newmont stockholders as disclosed in the company's non-gaap financial measure adjusted net income (loss). the allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of cas between gold and other metals.
sustaining capital and finance lease payments. we determined sustaining capital and finance lease payments as those capital expenditures and finance lease payments that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. we determined development (i.e. non-sustaining) capital expenditures and finance lease payments to be those payments used to develop new operations or related to projects at existing operations where those projects will materially benefit the operation and are excluded from the calculation of aisc. the classification of sustaining and development capital projects and finance leases is based on a systematic review of our project portfolio in light of the nature of each project. sustaining capital and finance lease payments are relevant to the aisc metric as these are needed to maintain the company's current operations and provide improved transparency related to our ability to finance these expenditures from current operations. the allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of cas between gold and other metals. we also allocate these costs incurred at the other north america, other australia and corporate and other locations using the proportion of cas between gold and other metals.

critical accounting estimates our discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our consolidated financial statements. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. we have identified the accounting estimates listed below as critical to understanding and evaluating the financial results reported in our consolidated financial statements. these accounting estimates require the application of significant management judgment and are critical due to the significant level of estimation uncertainty regarding the assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. we base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and various other sources that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. we review the underlying factors used in our estimates regularly, including reviewing the significant accounting policies impacting the estimates, to ensure compliance with gaap. however, due to the uncertainty inherent in our estimates, actual results may materially differ from the estimates we calculate due to changes in circumstances, global economics and politics, and general business conditions. a summary of our significant accounting policies is detailed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
depreciation and amortization expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to amortize such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment and their components. facilities and equipment acquired as a part of a finance lease, build-to-suit or other financing arrangement are recorded based on the contractual lease terms. the facilities and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the lesser of the lease terms or the estimated productive lives of such facilities. these lives do not exceed the estimated mine life based on proven and probable reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine.
costs incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as incurred where it has been determined that the property can be economically developed based on the existence of proven and probable reserves. at our surface mines, these costs include costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. at our underground mines, these costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and infrastructure development. all such costs are amortized using the uop method over the estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces or pounds to be produced from proven and probable reserves.
major mine development costs incurred after the commencement of production that are capitalized are amortized using the uop method based on estimated recoverable ounces or pounds to be produced from proven and probable reserves. to the extent that such costs benefit the entire ore body, they are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of the entire ore body. costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that block or area are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of that specific ore block or area.
capitalized asset retirement costs incurred are amortized according to how the related assets are being depreciated. open pit and underground mining costs are amortized using the uop method based on recoverable ounces by source. other costs, including leaching facilities, tailing facilities, and mills and other infrastructure costs, are amortized using the straight-line method over the same estimated future lives of the associated assets.
the calculation of the uop rate of amortization, and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations, could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable reserves. this would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining reserves. these changes could include: (i) an expansion of proven and probable reserves through exploration activities; (ii) differences between estimated and actual costs of production, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of reserves. if reserves decreased significantly, amortization charged to operations would increase; conversely, if reserves increased significantly, amortization charged to operations would decrease. such changes in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the life of the proven and probable reserves.
carrying value of stockpiles stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. mine sequencing may result in mining material at a faster rate than can be processed. we generally process the highest ore grade material first to maximize metal production; however, a blend of ore stockpiles may be processed to balance hardness and/or metallurgy in order to maximize throughput and recovery. processing of lower grade stockpiled ore may continue after mining operations are completed. sulfide copper ores are subject to oxidation over time which can reduce expected future recoveries. stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on assay data), and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on the expected processing method). stockpile ore tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. costs are added to stockpiles based on current mining costs, including applicable overhead and depreciation and amortization relating to mining operations and removed at each stockpile's average cost per recoverable unit as material is processed.
we record stockpiles at the lower of average cost or net realizable value, and carrying values are evaluated at least quarterly. net realizable value represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals price assumptions that are applied to expected short-term (12 months or less) and long-term sales from stockpiles, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. the primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of stockpiles include declines in short-term or long-term metals prices, increases in costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as realized mineral grades and recovery rates. the significant assumption in determining the stockpile net realizable value for each mine site at december 31, 2022 is a long-term gold price of $1,600 per ounce. a decrease of $100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption could result in an impairment of the carrying value of our stockpiles of up to approximately $70.
other assumptions include future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors unique to each operation based on the life of mine plans, as well as long-term commodity prices and applicable u.s. dollar long-term exchange rates. if short-term and long-term commodity prices decrease, estimated future processing costs increase, or other negative factors occur, it may be necessary to record a write-down of stockpiles. a high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions.
estimates of recoverable ore on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on ore type). in general, leach pads recover between 50% and 95% of the recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is complete.
although the quantities of recoverable metal placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of metal actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. as a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. historically, our operating results have not been materially impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable quantities of metal on our leach pads. variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to net realizable value are accounted for on a prospective basis. the significant assumption in determining the net realizable value for each mine site at december 31, 2022 is a long-term gold price of $1,600 per ounce. a decrease of $100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption would not result in a material write-down of the carrying value of the leach pads.
other assumptions include future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors unique to each operation based on the life of mine plans, as well as a long-term metal prices. if short-term and long-term commodity prices decrease, estimated future processing costs increase, or other negative factors occur, it may be necessary to record a write-down of ore on leach pads to net realizable value.
carrying value of long-lived assets we review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. significant negative industry or economic trends, adverse social or political developments, declines in our market capitalization, geotechnical difficulties, reduced estimates of future cash flows from our reporting segments or other disruptions to our business are a few examples of events that we monitor, as they could indicate that the carrying value of the company's long-lived assets, including development projects, may not be recoverable. in such cases, a recoverability test may be necessary to determine if an impairment charge is required.
for development projects, including our conga project which is discussed further below, we review and evaluate changes to project plans and timing to determine continued technical, economic and social viability of the projects. if the company determines to sell or abandon a project due to uncertainty from changes in circumstances related to technical, economic, social, political or community factors, or other evolving circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, then a recoverability test is performed to determine if an impairment charge should be recorded.
an impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the estimated fair value of the long-lived assets being tested for impairment and their carrying amounts. fair value is typically determined through the use of an income approach utilizing estimates of discounted pre-tax future cash flows or a market approach utilizing recent transaction activity for comparable properties. these approaches are primarily considered level 3 fair value measurements. occasionally, such as when an asset is held for sale, market prices are used. we believe our estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use.
the estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of our mining operations are derived from current business plans, which are developed using short-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and our projections for long-term average metal prices. in addition to short- and long-term metal price assumptions, other assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; value beyond proven and probable reserve estimates; estimated future closure costs; the use of appropriate discount rates; and applicable u.s. dollar long-term exchange rates. refer to item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
the significant assumption in determining the future cash flows for each mine site at december 31, 2022 is a long-term gold price of $1,600 per ounce. a decrease of $100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption could result in an impairment of our long-lived assets, including goodwill, of up to approximately $2,800 before consideration of other value beyond proven and probable reserves which may significantly decrease the amount of any potential impairment charge.
as discussed above under depreciation and amortization, various factors could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves which could impact the carrying value of our long-lived assets. the ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified measured, indicated and inferred resources could ultimately be mined economically. assets classified as exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling.
events that could result in additional impairment of our long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, decreases in future metal prices, unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, increases in future closure costs, and any event that might otherwise have a material adverse effect on mine site cash flows.
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in a business acquisition. goodwill is allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment annually as of december 31, 2022 and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. each operating mine is considered a distinct reporting unit for purposes of goodwill impairment testing.
the company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment when it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is higher than its carrying value. at the company's election or if it is determined to be more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. the fair value of a reporting unit is determined using either the income approach utilizing estimates of discounted future cash flows or the market valuation approach utilizing recent transaction activity for comparable properties. these approaches are considered level 3 fair value measurements. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. any impairment loss recognized in the current period is not reversed in future periods. the company recognizes its pro rata share of goodwill and any subsequent goodwill impairment losses recorded by entities that are proportionately consolidated.
when the income approach is utilized to determine fair value, the estimated cash flows used to assess the fair value of a reporting unit are derived from the company's current business plans, which are developed using short-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management's projections for long-term average metal prices. the significant assumption in determining the future cash flows for each mine site at december 31, 2022 is a long-term gold price of $1,600 per ounce. in addition to short- and long-term metal price assumptions, other assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; value beyond proven and probable estimates; estimated future closure costs; the use of appropriate discount rates; and applicable u.s. dollar long-term exchange rates. refer to item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk..
fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. for testing purposes of our reporting units, management's best estimates of the expected future results are the primary driver in determining the fair value. however, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the goodwill impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units include, but are not limited to, such items as: (i) a decrease in forecasted production levels if we are unable to realize the mineable reserves, resources and exploration potential at our mining properties and extend the life of mine (ii) increased production or capital costs (iii) adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions including the market price of metals and changes in the equity and debt markets or country specific factors which could result in higher discount rates, (iv) significant unfavorable changes in tax rates including increased corporate income or mining tax rates, and (v) negative changes in regulation, legislation, and political environments which could impact our ability to operate in the future. while historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of our reporting units equal to or in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future.
carrying value of conga we review and evaluate the company's conga development project for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. we have considered a variety of technical, economic, social and political developments related to the conga project during our evaluation of impairment indicators since november 2011, when construction and development activities at the project were largely suspended. project activities in recent years have focused on continued engagement with the local communities and maintaining and protecting existing project infrastructure and equipment through our active care and maintenance program. although we have reclassified conga reserves to resources and reallocated exploration and development capital to other projects, we continue to evaluate long-term options to progress development of the conga project and improve social and political acceptance. while we have reprioritized the yanacocha sulfides project ahead of the conga project, we have delayed the full-funds decision and are currently in the process of assessing project plan options for the yanacocha sulfides project. the company also periodically updates the economic model for its conga project to understand changes to the estimated capital costs, cash flows, and economic returns from the project. as of december 31, 2022, we have not identified events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the conga project is not recoverable.
derivative instruments all financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations, except for the portion of the change in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges. management applies judgment in estimating the fair value of instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions such as commodity prices, market volatilities, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. variations in these factors could materially affect amounts credited or charged to earnings to reflect the changes in fair value of derivatives. certain derivative contracts are designated as effective cash flow hedges, whereby the changes in fair value of these instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to income in the consolidated statements of operations when the underlying transaction designated as the hedged item impacts earnings. to the extent that management determines that the forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring, gains and losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations immediately.
reclamation and remediation obligations the company records the estimated asset retirement obligations associated with operating and non-operating mine sites when an obligation is incurred and the fair value can be reasonably estimated. fair value is measured as the present value of expected cash flow estimates, after considering inflation, our credit-adjusted risk-free rates and a market risk premium appropriate for our operations. reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. reclamation obligations are based on our best estimate of when the expected spending for an existing environmental disturbance will occur. our cost estimates are reflected on a third-party cost basis and comply with our legal obligation to retire long-lived assets in the period incurred. changes in reclamation estimates at non-operating mines where the mine or portion of the mine site has entered the closure phase and has no substantive future economic value are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. costs included in estimated asset retirement obligations are discounted to their present value and are estimated over a period of up to fifty years. we review, on at least an annual basis, the reclamation obligation at each mine.
remediation costs are accrued when it is probable that an obligation has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated. such cost estimates may include ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. changes in remediation estimates at non-operating mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. water treatment costs included in environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their present value and are estimated over a period of up to fifty years.
accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs the company expects to incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. these estimates require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying inputs and assumptions. such changes, including, but not limited to, (i) changes to environmental laws and regulations, which could increase the scope and extent of work required, (ii) changes in the timing of reclamation and remediation activities, which could occur over an extended future period and (iii) changes in the methods and technology utilized to settle reclamation and remediation obligations, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
income and mining taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method, recognizing certain temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of our liabilities and assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and assets. this method generates either a net deferred income tax liability or asset for us, as measured by the statutory tax rates in effect. we derive our deferred income tax charge or benefit by recording the change in either the net deferred income tax liability or asset balance for the year. the financial statement effects of changes in tax law are recorded as discrete items in the period enacted as part of income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations, regardless of the category of income or loss to which the deferred taxes relate. we have exposure to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on tax positions in certain jurisdictions, such movements are recorded within income and mining tax benefit (expense) related to deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as non-current uncertain tax positions, while foreign exchange fluctuations impacting current tax positions are recorded within other income (loss), net as foreign currency exchange gains (losses). with respect to the earnings that we derive from the operations of our consolidated subsidiaries, in those situations where the earnings are indefinitely reinvested, no deferred taxes have been provided on the unremitted earnings (including the excess of the carrying value of the net equity of such entities for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of such equity) of these consolidated companies.
mining taxes represent state and provincial taxes levied on mining operations and are classified as income taxes as such taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits.
our operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. we are subject to reviews of our income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of its contracts or laws. we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the u.s. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether it is more likely than not, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would result. we recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income and mining tax benefit (expense). in certain jurisdictions, we must pay a portion of the disputed amount to the local government in order to formally appeal the assessment. such payment is recorded as a receivable if we believe the amount is ultimately collectible.
valuation of deferred tax assets our deferred income tax assets include certain future tax benefits. we record a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax assets when we believe, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized. we review the likelihood that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets and therefore the need for valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if events indicate that a review is required. in determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset is considered, along with all other available positive and negative evidence.
certain categories of evidence carry more weight in the analysis than others based upon the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. we look to the nature and severity of cumulative pretax losses (if any) in the current three-year period ending on the evaluation date or the expectation of future pretax losses and the existence and frequency of prior cumulative pretax losses.
we utilize a rolling twelve quarters of pre-tax income or loss as a measure of our cumulative results in recent years. concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years. however, a cumulative three year loss is not solely determinative of the need for a valuation allowance. we also consider all other available positive and negative evidence in our analysis.
other factors considered in the determination of the probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets include, but are not limited to:
•projected future financial and taxable income based upon existing reserves and long-term estimates of commodity prices;
•nature of temporary differences and predictability of reversal patterns of existing temporary differences; and
•the sensitivity of future forecasted results to commodity prices and other factors.
the company assesses available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. a significant piece of objective negative evidence is recent pretax losses and/or expectations of future pretax losses. such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence including projections for future growth. on the basis of this evaluation, a valuation allowance has been recorded in peru. the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.

item 7. - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, and other financial information included in this form 10-k. certain statements in this "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" are forward-looking statements. see "special note regarding forward-looking statements."
overview we view each of our integrated resorts as an operating segment. our operating segments in macao consist of the venetian macao; the londoner macao; the parisian macao; the plaza macao and four seasons macao; and the sands macao. our operating segment in singapore is marina bay sands.
on february 23, 2022, we closed on the sale of our las vegas real property and operations, including the venetian resort las vegas and the sands expo and convention center (the "las vegas operations"), for $6.25 billion (the "las vegas sale"). at closing, we received approximately $5.05 billion in cash proceeds, before transaction costs and working capital adjustments of $77 million, a $1.20 billion seller financing loan and recognized a gain on disposal of $3.60 billion, before income tax expense of $750 million, during the year ended december 31, 2022.
during 2022, we achieved milestones in advancing several of our strategic objectives. we were awarded a new 10-year gaming concession for the operation of casino games of chance in macao under the concession entered into with the macao government. we completed our key development project in macao with the conversion of sands cotai central into the londoner macao, in which the londoner arena and the expansion of the shoppes at londoner were completed during the first half of 2022. we began renovations at marina bay sands, to provide world-class suites in tower 1 and tower 2, and welcomed the return of marina bay sands to normal operating conditions in the second half of 2022 with the removal of various covid-19 restrictions. we also continued to strengthen our balance sheet with the completion of the sale of the las vegas operations.
covid-19 pandemic update while visitation to macao remains substantially below pre-covid-19 pandemic levels, the macao government's policy regarding the management of covid-19 and general travel restrictions has adjusted in line with changes in policy in mainland china in late december 2022 and early january 2023. currently, visitors from mainland china, hong kong and taiwan may enter macao, subject to them holding the appropriate travel documents, without having to present any proof of covid-19 testing. arrivals from foreign countries must provide proof of a negative covid-19 nucleic acid test ("nat") or antigen test completed within 48 hours prior to arrival. our operations in macao will continue to be impacted and subject to changes in the government policies of macao, mainland china, hong kong and other jurisdictions in asia addressing travel and public health measures associated with covid-19.
throughout the year ended december 31, 2022, various outbreaks occurred in the region, particularly in hong kong in late january and early february, the guangdong province in march, macao in mid-june and zhuhai in early october, all of which resulted in various travel, border and/or operational restrictions. specifically, on july 9, 2022, the macao government ordered casinos and all non-essential businesses to close from july 11 to july 18 in an attempt to control the outbreak in macao, which was extended through july 22, 2022. on july 20, 2022, the macao government announced a consolidation period, which started on july 23, 2022 and ended on july 30, 2022, whereby certain business activities were allowed to resume limited operations; however, casino operations resumed, but with a maximum capacity of 50% of casino staff working at any point. throughout august, these preventative measures were gradually reduced, as well as various restrictions on movement between macao and zhuhai were progressively lifted by both the macao and mainland china governments.
various travel restrictions, such as border closures, mandatory quarantines and proof of negative covid-19 testing on arrival in macao, among others, were in effect at various times during the year ended december 31, 2022, resulting in fluctuations in guest travel and visitation.
table of contents the hong kong / macao express bus service and the ferry services between the taipa ferry terminal and hong kong international airport recommenced on december 24, 2022 and december 30, 2022, respectively. our ferry operations between macao and hong kong were suspended throughout 2022 and resumed operation on a limited basis on january 8, 2023.
our macao gaming operations remained open during most of the year ended december 31, 2022. while guest visitation has begun to recover with the gradual relaxation of travel and quarantine restrictions, the timing and manner in which our casinos, restaurants and shopping malls will operate at full capacity will progressively be assessed against business volumes.
at our macao properties, all social distancing requirements, including those requiring reduced seating at table games and a decreased number of active slot machines on the casino floor compared to pre-covid-19 levels, have ceased in early january 2023.
as with prior periods, in support of the macao government's initiatives to fight the covid-19 pandemic, at various times throughout the year ended december 31, 2022, we provided both towers of the sheraton grand macao hotel and also the parisian macao hotel to the macao government to house individuals for quarantine and medical observation purposes.
our operations in macao have been significantly impacted by the reduced visitation to macao. the macao government announced total visitation from mainland china to macao decreased approximately 27.5% and 81.7%, during the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021 and 2019 (pre-pandemic), respectively. the macao government also announced gross gaming revenue decreased approximately 51.4% and 85.6%, during the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021 and 2019, respectively.
in singapore, the vaccinated travel framework ("vtf") was launched on april 1, 2022, to facilitate the resumption of travel for all travelers, including short-term visitors. under the vtf, all fully vaccinated travelers are permitted to enter singapore, without entry approvals, and starting april 26, 2022, these travelers are no longer required to take a covid-19 test before departing for singapore. non-fully vaccinated travelers need only take a pre-departure test within two days before departure for singapore and test negative before departing for singapore. operations at marina bay sands will continue to be impacted and subject to changes in the government policies of singapore and other jurisdictions in asia, if any, addressing travel and public health measures associated with covid-19.
visitation to marina bay sands continues to be impacted by the effects of the covid-19 pandemic; however, visitation has increased since restrictions have been lifted. the stb announced total visitation to singapore increased from approximately 330,000 in 2021 to 6.3 million in 2022, while visitation decreased 67.0% when compared to the same period in 2019.
while our properties were open and some operating at reduced levels due to lower visitation and required safety measures in place as described above during the year ended december 31, 2022, the current economic and regulatory environment on a global basis and in each of our jurisdictions continue to evolve. we cannot predict the manner in which governments will react as the global and regional impact of the covid-19 pandemic changes over time, which could significantly alter our current operations.
we have a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity in place, including total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $6.31 billion and access to $1.50 billion, $541 million and $439 million of available borrowing capacity from our lvsc revolving facility, 2018 scl revolving facility and the 2012 singapore revolving facility, respectively, as of december 31, 2022. we believe we are able to support continuing operations, complete the major construction projects that are underway and respond to the current covid-19 pandemic challenges. we have taken various mitigating measures to manage through the current environment, including a cost and capital expenditure reduction program to minimize cash outflow for nonessential items.
2022 (the "subconcession amendment"). vml paid the macao government 47 million patacas (approximately $6 million at exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction) and provided a bank guarantee on september 20, 2022, of 2.31 billion patacas (approximately $289 million at exchange rates as defined in the bank guarantee contract) to secure the fulfillment of vml's payment obligations towards its employees if vml were unsuccessful in tendering for a new concession contract after its subconcession expired.
on november 26, 2022, the macao government awarded six concessions to six of the bidders on a temporary basis, of which vml was one, subject to fulfillment of certain conditions, namely providing a bank guarantee of 1.0 billion patacas (approximately $125 million at exchange rates in effect on december 31, 2022) to secure the fulfillment of vml's legal, contractual and other obligations, including labor obligations. vml complied with all of these conditions by december 9, 2022. on december 16, 2022, the macao government awarded six concessions on a definitive basis, of which vml was one, and vml entered into the concession with the macao government, effective as of january 1, 2023, and for the duration of ten years. on december 19, 2022, vml requested the release of all the bank guarantees it provided to the macao government under its subconcession, and in january 2023 such bank guarantees were released, including the 2.31 billion patacas bank guarantee.
on december 30, 2022, in accordance with the requirements of the gaming law and their obligations under letters of undertakings (the "undertakings"), each of vml, venetian cotai limited ("vcl"), venetian orient limited ("vol") and cotai strip lot 2 apart hotel (macau) limited ("csl2," a subsidiary of scl) entered into deeds of reversion, pursuant to which each of vml, vcl, vol and csl2 confirmed and agreed to revert to the macao government relevant gaming equipment and gaming areas (as identified in the undertakings) without compensation and free of any liens or charges upon the expiry of the term of the subconcession extension period. on the same day, vml entered into a handover record (the "handover record"), pursuant to which the right to operate the same gaming equipment and gaming areas was granted to vml for the duration of the concession, in return for annual payments of 750 patacas per square meter for the first three years and 2,500 patacas per square meter for the following seven years (approximately $93 and $311, respectively, at exchange rates in effect on december 31, 2022). the annual payment of 750 patacas per square meter will be adjusted with the macao average price index of the corresponding preceding year for years two and three and the annual payment of 2,500 patacas per square meter will be adjusted with the macao average price index of the corresponding preceding year for years five through ten.
inflation reduction act the inflation reduction act of 2022 ("ira") was signed into law on august 16, 2022. the ira contains numerous provisions including a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax ("camt") for certain large corporations that have at least an average of $1 billion adjusted financial statement income over a consecutive three-year period effective in tax years beginning after december 31, 2022. applicable corporations would be allowed to claim a credit for the corporate minimum tax paid against regular tax in future years. the ira also includes a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases beginning january 1, 2023. the camt could impact our future cash flows and results of operations. the internal revenue service has been granted broad authority to issue regulations or other guidance that could clarify how these taxes will be applied. we will continue to evaluate the impact of the ira as additional information becomes available.
intercompany loan agreement with scl on july 11, 2022, we entered into an intercompany term loan agreement with scl, a related party, in the amount of $1.0 billion, which is repayable on july 11, 2028. in the first two years from july 11, 2022, scl will have the option to elect to pay cash interest at 5% per annum or payment-in-kind interest at 6% per annum by adding the amount of such interest to the then-outstanding principal amount of the loan, following which only cash interest at 5% per annum will be payable. this loan is unsecured, subordinated to all third party unsecured indebtedness and other obligations of scl and its subsidiaries and is eliminated in consolidation.
key operating revenue measurements operating revenues at the venetian macao, the londoner macao, the parisian macao, the plaza macao and four seasons macao, marina bay sands and our las vegas operating properties, prior to its sale on february 23, 2022, are dependent upon the volume of customers who stay at the hotel, which affects the price charged for hotel table of contents rooms and our gaming volume. operating revenues at sands macao are principally driven by casino customers who visit the property on a daily basis.
management utilizes the following volume and pricing measures in order to evaluate past performance and assist in forecasting future revenues. the various volume measurements indicate our ability to attract customers to our integrated resorts. in casino operations, win and hold percentages indicate the amount of revenue to be expected based on volume. in hotel operations, average daily rate and revenue per available room indicate the demand for rooms and our ability to capture that demand. in mall operations, base rent per square foot indicates our ability to attract and maintain profitable tenants for our leasable space.
casino revenue measurements for macao and singapore: macao and singapore table games are segregated into two groups: rolling chip play (composed of vip players) and non-rolling chip play (mostly non-vip players). the volume measurement for rolling chip play is non-negotiable gaming chips wagered and lost. the volume measurement for non-rolling chip play is table games drop ("drop"), which is net markers issued (credit instruments), cash deposited in the table drop boxes and gaming chips purchased and exchanged at the cage. rolling chip and non-rolling chip volume measurements are not comparable as they are two distinct measures of volume. the amounts wagered and lost for rolling chip play are substantially higher than the amounts dropped for non-rolling chip play. slot handle, also a volume measurement, is the gross amount wagered for the period cited.
we view rolling chip win as a percentage of rolling chip volume, non-rolling chip win as a percentage of drop and slot hold (amount won by the casino) as a percentage of slot handle. win or hold percentage represents the percentage of rolling chip volume, non-rolling chip drop or slot handle that is won by the casino and recorded as casino revenue. our win and hold percentages are calculated before discounts, commissions, deferring revenue associated with our loyalty programs and allocating casino revenues related to goods and services provided to patrons on a complimentary basis. our rolling chip win percentage is expected to be 3.15% to 3.45% in macao and singapore. actual win percentage may vary from our expected win percentage and historical win and hold percentages. generally, slot machine play is conducted on a cash basis. in macao and singapore, 9.8% and 15.8%, respectively, of our table games play was conducted on a credit basis for the year ended december 31, 2022.
casino revenue measurements for the u.s.: the volume measurements in the u.s. were slot handle, as previously described, and table games drop, which was the total amount of cash and net markers issued (credit instruments) deposited in the table drop box. we viewed table games win as a percentage of drop and slot hold as a percentage of slot handle. our win and hold percentages were calculated before discounts, commissions, deferring revenue associated with our loyalty programs and allocating casino revenues related to goods and services provided to patrons on a complimentary basis. similar to macao and singapore, slot machine play was generally conducted on a cash basis.
hotel revenue measurements: performance indicators used are occupancy rate (a volume indicator), which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period, and average daily room rate ("adr," a price indicator), which is the average price of occupied rooms per day. available rooms exclude those rooms unavailable for occupancy during the period due to renovation, development or other requirements (such as government mandated closure, lodging for team members and usage by the macao and singapore governments for quarantine measures). the calculations of the occupancy rate and adr include the impact of rooms provided on a complimentary basis. revenue per available room ("revpar") represents a summary of hotel adr and occupancy. because not all available rooms are occupied, adr is normally higher than revpar. reserved rooms where the guests do not show up for their stay and lose their deposit, or where guests check out early, may be re-sold to walk-in guests.
mall revenue measurements: occupancy, base rent per square foot and tenant sales per square foot are used as performance indicators. occupancy represents gross leasable occupied area ("gloa") divided by gross leasable area ("gla") at the end of the reporting period. gloa is the sum of: (1) tenant occupied space under lease and (2) tenants no longer occupying space, but paying rent. gla does not include space currently under development or not on the market for lease. base rent per square foot is the weighted average base or minimum rent charge, excluding rent concessions, in effect at the end of the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in occupancy. tenant sales per square foot is the sum of reported comparable sales for the trailing table of contents
12 months divided by the comparable square footage for the same period. only tenants that have been open for a minimum of 12 months are included in the tenant sales per square foot calculation.
summary financial results the reopening of borders and elimination of most pandemic-related restrictions in singapore positively impacted the financial results of marina bay sands. in contrast, tighter border and travel restrictions had an adverse impact at our macao operations. see "covid-19 pandemic update" for further information.
net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2022 were $4.11 billion, compared to $4.23 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. operating loss was $792 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $689 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. net loss from continuing operations was $1.54 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $1.47 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021.
2022                                                                     2021                      percent change
consolidated net revenues were $4.11 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $124 million compared to $4.23 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021, driven by a decrease of $1.27 billion  at our macao operations due to decreased visitation as tighter border restrictions were introduced throughout 2022 as a result of increased covid-19 cases in macao and the surrounding region. the decrease was partially offset by an increase of $1.15 billion at marina bay sands, primarily due to increased visitation from the reopening of borders and elimination of most pandemic-related restrictions in april 2022.
net casino revenues decreased $265 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease was driven by a $1.04 billion decrease at our macao operations due to lower visitation across our properties resulting in decreased table games and slot volumes. casino revenues at marina bay sands increased by $775 million due to increased table games and slot volumes, driven by the reopening of borders and elimination of most pandemic-related restrictions, partially offset by a lower rolling chip win percentage. the following table summarizes the results of our casino activity:
2022                                                                        2021                        change
2022                                                                              2021                        change
2022                                                                           2021                        change
(1)    the las vegas operating properties are classified as a discontinued operation. we completed the sale on february 23, 2022. financial results are for the period through february 22, 2022.
in our experience, average win percentages remain fairly consistent when measured over extended periods of time with a significant volume of wagers, but can vary considerably within shorter time periods as a result of the statistical variances associated with games of chance in which large amounts are wagered.
table of contents room revenues increased $54 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily due to increased occupancy rates and adr at marina bay sands driven by increased visitation, partially offset by decreased occupancy rates and adr driven by reduced visitation at our macao properties. the following table summarizes the results of our room activity:
2022                                                                          2021                        change
(1)during the year ended december 31, 2022, approximately 500 rooms were under construction for renovation purposes.
(2)the las vegas operating properties are classified as a discontinued operation. we completed the sale on february 23, 2022. financial results are for the period through february 22, 2022.
table of contents food and beverage revenues increased $102 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was due to a $128 million increase driven by increased business volume at food and beverage outlets and banquets at marina bay sands, partially offset by a decrease of $26 million at our macao operations.

operating expenses were $4.90 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $21 million compared to $4.92 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease was primarily driven by a $276 million decrease in casino expenses, partially offset by increases of $105 million in general and administrative expenses, $75 million in food and beverage expenses, $34 million in in development expenses and $24 million in corporate expenses.
food and beverage expenses increased $75 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was due to an $86 million increase at marina bay sands, driven by increased business volume at food outlets and banquets and consistent with increased revenues, partially offset by an $11 million decrease at our macao operations.
convention, retail and other expenses increased $18 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, primarily driven by an increase of $16 million, consistent with increased revenues at marina bay sands.
the provision for credit losses was $15 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $3 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the $12 million increase was primarily driven by an $11 million increase at marina bay sands due to an increase in new credit issued and patrons who were unable to return to the property. the amount of this provision can vary over short periods of time because of factors specific to the patrons who owe us money from gaming activities. we believe the amount of our provision for credit losses in the future will depend upon the state of the economy, our credit standards, our risk assessments and the judgment of our employees responsible for granting credit.
table of contents general and administrative expenses increased $105 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, primarily driven by increases at marina bay sands. the increases were primarily driven by increases in property operation costs, marketing and payroll to support the increased visitation and property tax and insurance costs.
pre-opening expenses represent personnel and other costs incurred prior to the opening of new ventures, which are expensed as incurred. the majority of pre-opening expenses for the year ended december 31, 2022, related to marina bay sands. pre-opening expenses for the year ended december 31, 2021, related to the londoner macao.
development expenses were $143 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $109 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. during the year ended december 31, 2022, the costs were associated with our evaluation and pursuit of new business opportunities, primarily in florida and texas, and our digital gaming related efforts. development costs are expensed as incurred.
loss on disposal or impairment of assets was $9 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $27 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the losses incurred for the year ended december 31, 2022, were primarily due to $4 million in asset disposals related to aircraft parts and $3 million in asset disposal and demolition costs, primarily at the londoner macao, the venetian macao, sands macao and our corporate offices. the losses for the year ended december 31, 2021, were primarily due to asset disposals and demolition costs related to the londoner macao.
segment adjusted property ebitda the following table summarizes information related to our segments (see "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 20 - segment information" for discussion of our operating segments):
2022                                                                             2021                      percent change

(1)consolidated adjusted property ebitda, which is a non-gaap financial measure, is used by management as the primary measure of the operating performance of our segments. consolidated adjusted property ebitda is net income/loss before stock-based compensation expense, corporate expense, pre-opening expense, development expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of leasehold interests in land, gain or loss on disposal or impairment of assets, interest, other income or expense, gain or loss on modification or early retirement of debt and income taxes. consolidated adjusted property ebitda is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure used by management, as well as industry analysts, to evaluate operations and operating performance. in particular, management utilizes consolidated adjusted property ebitda to compare the operating profitability of our operations with those of our competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain table of contents incentive compensation. integrated resort companies have historically reported adjusted property ebitda as a supplemental performance measure to gaap financial measures. in order to view the operations of their properties on a more stand-alone basis, integrated resort companies, including las vegas sands corp., have historically excluded certain expenses that do not relate to the management of specific properties, such as pre-opening expense, development expense and corporate expense, from their adjusted property ebitda calculations. consolidated adjusted property ebitda should not be interpreted as an alternative to income from operations (as an indicator of operating performance) or to cash flows from operations (as a measure of liquidity), in each case, as determined in accordance with gaap. we have significant uses of cash flow, including capital expenditures, dividend payments, interest payments, debt principal repayments and income taxes, which are not reflected in consolidated adjusted property ebitda. not all companies calculate adjusted property ebitda in the same manner. as a result, our presentation of consolidated adjusted property ebitda may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

adjusted property ebitda at our macao operations decreased $662 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease was primarily due to decreased casino, mall and room revenues, driven by decreased visitation at our properties as tighter border and travel restrictions were in place in 2022 as a result of increased covid-19 cases in macao and the surrounding areas.
adjusted property ebitda at marina bay sands increased $608 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily due to increased casino, room, food and beverage and mall operations driven by increased visitation and loosened pandemic-related restrictions implemented in april 2022.
discontinued operation adjusted property ebitda at our las vegas operating properties decreased $227 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease was primarily due to the current year activity representing only 53 days of operations as we completed the sale of the las vegas operating properties on february 23, 2022, partially table of contents offset by increased casino and room operations as las vegas operating properties operated under pre-pandemic guidelines.
interest expense the following table summarizes information related to interest expense:
less - capitalized interest                     (4)                            (15)
cash paid for interest                         $618                            $606
interest cost increased $70 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, resulting primarily from increases in our weighted average interest rate and weighted average total debt balance. the weighted average debt balance increased due to draws of $1.20 billion on the scl revolver during the year ended december 31, 2022. additionally, the weighted average interest rate increased primarily due to increased interest rates on the scl revolver and the mbs credit facility in line with increases in market rates and increased interest rates on the scl senior notes in connection with the credit rating downgrades in february and june 2022 (see "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 12 - long-term debt").
other factors affecting earnings interest income was $116 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $4 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. this increase was primarily from the $90 million in interest income on money market funds and bank deposits driven by an increase in cash due to the sale of the las vegas operating properties and higher interest rates. we also had $21 million in interest income from the seller financing loan in connection with the sale of the las vegas operating properties in 2022.
other expense was $9 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $31 million during the year ended december 31, 2021. the change was due to the fluctuation in the exchange rate between the u.s. dollar and pataca in connection with our u.s. dollar denominated debt held by scl.
our income tax expense was $154 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $1.39 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, resulting in an 11.1% effective income tax rate. this compares to a (0.3)% effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2021. the income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2022, reflects a 17% statutory tax rate on our singapore operations, a 21% corporate income tax rate on our u.s. operations, and a zero percent tax rate on our macao gaming operations due to our income tax exemption in macao. our u.s. operations recorded a valuation allowance on certain u.s. foreign tax credits, which we no longer expect to utilize. our u.s. tax expense was partially offset by a tax benefit associated with the pre-tax book losses incurred for the year ended december 31, 2022.
we have had the benefit of a corporate tax exemption in macao, which exempts us from paying the 12% corporate income tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games, but does not apply to our non-gaming activities. we continued to benefit from this tax exemption through december 31, 2022. additionally, we entered into a shareholder dividend tax agreement with the macao government in april 2019, effective through june 26, 2022, providing an annual payment as a substitution for a 12% tax otherwise due from vml shareholders on dividend distributions paid from vml gaming profits. in december 2022, we requested a corporate tax exemption on profits generated by the operation of casino games in macao for the new gaming concession period effective from january 1, 2023 through december 31, 2032, or for a period of corporate tax exemption that the chief executive of macao may deem more appropriate. we are evaluating the timing of an application for a new shareholder dividend tax agreement.
table of contents the net loss attributable to our noncontrolling interests from continuing operations was $475 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to $315 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. these amounts were related to the noncontrolling interest of scl.
additional information regarding our retail mall operations the following tables summarize the results of our mall operations on the cotai strip and at marina bay sands for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021:

(3)    commercial property that generates rental income is exempt from property tax for the first six years for newly constructed buildings in cotai. if the property also qualifies for tourism utility status, the property tax exemption can be extended to twelve years with effect from the opening of the property. to date, the venetian macao, the plaza macao and four seasons macao, the londoner macao and the parisian macao have obtained an extended exemption. the exemption for the venetian macao and the plaza macao and four seasons macao expired in august 2019 and august 2020, respectively, and the exemption for the londoner macao and the parisian macao will be expiring in december 2027 and september 2028, respectively.
(4) mall-related expenses consist of cam, marketing fees and other direct operating expenses, property taxes and provision for credit losses, but excludes depreciation and amortization and general and administrative costs.
(5)    the amount for marina bay sands of $6 million related to a grant provided by the singapore government to lessors to support small and medium enterprises impacted by the covid-19 pandemic in connection with their rent obligations.
it is common in the mall operating industry for companies to disclose mall net operating income ("noi") as a useful supplemental measure of a mall's operating performance. because noi excludes general and administrative expenses, interest expense, impairment losses, depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, allocations to noncontrolling interests and provision for income taxes, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate properties and the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.
in the table above, we believe taking total mall revenues less mall-related expenses provides an operating performance measure for our malls. other mall operating companies may use different methodologies for deriving mall-related expenses. as such, this calculation may not be comparable to the noi of other mall operating companies.

cash flows - operating activities table games play at our properties is conducted on a cash and credit basis, while slot machine play is primarily conducted on a cash basis. our rooms, food and beverage and other non-gaming revenues are conducted primarily on a cash basis and to a lesser extent as a trade receivable. operating cash flows are generally affected by changes in operating income, accounts receivable, gaming related liabilities and interest payments. for the year ended december 31, 2022, cash used in operations was $944 million, an increase of $701 million compared to $243 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase in cash used for operations was primarily due to cash tax payments inclusive of, and primarily due to, the gain on sale of the las vegas operations totaling $612 million, and our macao operations generating increased operating losses and working capital requirements due to the decrease in visitation resulting from covid-19 travel restrictions across key china markets in 2022 and macao experiencing covid-19 cases at various times throughout 2022. this cash usage was partially offset by operating cash flows provided by marina bay sands due to the acceleration of visitation and elimination of restrictions in singapore over the course of 2022.
cash flows - investing activities capital expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2022, totaled $651 million. included in this amount was $348 million at marina bay sands in singapore and $243 million for construction and development activities in macao, which consisted of $175 million for the londoner macao, $52 million for the venetian macao, $9 million for the plaza macao and four seasons macao, $4 million for sands macao and $3 million for the parisian macao. additionally, this amount included $60 million for corporate and other.
table of contents capital expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2021, totaled $828 million, including $653 million in macao, which consisted of $551 million for the londoner macao, $71 million for the venetian macao and $19 million for the plaza macao and four seasons macao primarily for the grand suites at four seasons, $7 million from sands macao, $4 million for the parisian macao and $1 million for ferry and other; $148 million at marina bay sands in singapore; and $27 million for corporate and other.
cash flows - financing activities net cash flows generated from financing activities were $6.15 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, which was primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the sale of the las vegas operating properties of $4.89 billion and $1.20 billion from the drawdown of our scl revolving facility. these items were partially offset by $66 million in repayments on long-term debt and $11 million in deferred offering costs relating to obtaining lvsc revolving facility lender consents to consummate the las vegas sale and the covenant waiver obtained on the 2018 scl credit facility.
net cash flows generated from financing activities were $863 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, which was primarily attributable to net proceeds of $756 million, received from the drawdown of our scl revolving facility, and transactions with discontinued operations. these items were partially offset by a $131 million make-whole premium for the early redemption of the scl senior note due 2023 and $38 million in financing costs related to the issuance of the new unsecured notes at scl and the covenant waivers obtained on the lvsc revolving facility, 2018 scl credit facility and 2012 singapore credit facility.
as of december 31, 2022, we had $2.48 billion available for borrowing under our u.s., macao and singapore revolving facilities, net of letters of credit. additionally, we had $2.74 billion available for borrowing under the 2012 singapore delayed draw term facility to finance construction costs incurred in connection with the mbs expansion project.
cash flows - discontinued operations cash flows from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, were primarily attributable to $4.89 billion in net proceeds from the las vegas sale, which were transferred to continuing operations.
capital financing overview we fund our development projects primarily through borrowings from our debt instruments (see "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 12 - long-term debt") and operating cash flows.
on february 23, 2022, we closed the sale of our las vegas operations. at closing, we received approximately $5.05 billion in cash proceeds, before transaction costs and income taxes. the net proceeds of approximately $4.36 billion, after working capital adjustments, transaction costs and the payment of income taxes throughout 2022, will be used for incremental liquidity and general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures and development activities. in connection with the closing of the sale, we may be required to make certain payments ("support payments") to opco. the support payments are payable on a monthly basis following the closing through the year ending december 31, 2023, based upon the performance of the las vegas operations relative to certain agreed upon target metrics and subject to quarterly and annual adjustments. our remaining payment obligations are subject to a cap equal to $250 million for the period beginning january 1, 2023 and ending december 31, 2023. no support payments were made for the period post-close through december 31, 2022. on january 31, 2023, the company received notice from opco that the contingent lease support agreement had terminated pursuant to its terms and that neither party would have any further liability or obligation thereunder.
our u.s., scl and singapore credit facilities, as amended, contain various financial covenants, which include maintaining a maximum leverage ratio or net debt, as defined, to trailing twelve-month adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined. in september 2021, lvsc extended the amendment, pursuant to which lenders, among other things, removed lvsc's requirement to maintain a maximum leverage ratio as of the last day of the fiscal quarter, through and including december 31, 2022. in november 2022, scl extended the waiver and amendment request letter, pursuant to which lenders, among other things, waived scl's requirement to ensure the leverage ratio does not exceed 4.0x and the interest coverage ratio is greater than table of contents
2.50x, through july 31, 2023. in september 2021, mbs extended the amendment letter, pursuant to which mbs will not have to comply with the leverage or interest coverage covenants as of the last day of the fiscal quarter, through and including december 31, 2022. our compliance with our financial covenants for periods beyond december 31, 2022 could be affected by certain factors beyond our control, such as the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, including travel, quarantine and border restrictions occurring in the future. we will pursue additional waivers to meet the required financial covenant ratios, which include a maximum leverage ratio of 4.0x, 4.0x and 4.5x under our u.s., macao and singapore credit facilities, respectively, for periods beyond december 31, 2022 for lvsc and mbs and july 31, 2023 for scl, if deemed necessary. we believe we will be successful in obtaining the additional waivers, although no assurance can be provided that such waivers will be granted, which could negatively impact our ability to be in compliance with our debt covenants for periods beyond december 31, 2022 for lvsc and mbs and july 31, 2023 for scl. the 2018 scl credit facility expires on july 31, 2023; however, we believe we will be successful in extending the maturity date of the facility prior to its expiration. if we are unable to extend the maturity date or refinance the 2018 scl credit facility, we would be required to seek alternative forms of capital to repay the outstanding balance and our available liquidity may be reduced.
on january 30, 2023, lvsc entered into the fourth amendment with lenders to the lvsc revolving credit agreement. pursuant to the fourth amendment, the existing lvsc revolving credit agreement was amended to (a) determine consolidated adjusted ebitda on a year-to-date annualized basis during the period commencing on the effective date and ending on and including december 31, 2023, as follows: (i) for the fiscal quarter ending march 31, 2023, consolidated adjusted ebitda for such fiscal quarter multiplied by four, (ii) for the fiscal quarter ending june 30, 2023, consolidated adjusted ebitda for such fiscal quarter and the immediately preceding fiscal quarter multiplied by two, and (iii) for the fiscal quarter ending september 30, 2023, consolidated adjusted ebitda for such fiscal quarter and the two immediately preceding fiscal quarters, multiplied by four-thirds; (b) extend the period during which lvsc is required to maintain a specified amount of minimum liquidity as of the last day of each month to december 31, 2023; and (c) extend the period during which lvsc is unable to declare or pay any dividend or other distribution, unless liquidity is greater than $1.0 billion on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such dividend or distribution, to december 31, 2023.
any defaults under our debt agreements would allow the lenders, in each case, to exercise their rights and remedies as defined under their respective agreements. if the lenders were to exercise their rights to accelerate the due dates of the indebtedness outstanding, there can be no assurance we would be able to repay or refinance any amounts that may become due and payable under such agreements, which could force us to restructure or alter our operations or debt obligations.
we held unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $6.31 billion and restricted cash of $125 million as of december 31, 2022, of which approximately $2.57 billion of the unrestricted amount is held by non-u.s. subsidiaries. of the $2.57 billion, approximately $2.06 billion is available to be repatriated, either in the form of dividends or via intercompany loans or advances, to the u.s., subject to levels of earnings, cash flow generated from gaming operations and various other factors, including dividend requirements to third-party public stockholders in the case of funds being repatriated from scl, compliance with certain local statutes, laws and regulations currently applicable to our subsidiaries and restrictions in connection with their contractual arrangements. we do not expect withholding taxes or other foreign income taxes to apply should these earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise.
we believe the cash on hand and cash flow generated from operations, as well as the $2.48 billion available for borrowing under our u.s., macao and singapore credit facilities, net of outstanding letters of credit, and sgd 3.69 billion (approximately $2.74 billion at exchange rates in effect on december 31, 2022) under the 2012 singapore delayed draw term facility, as of december 31, 2022 (only available for draws after the construction cost estimate and construction schedule for the mbs expansion project have been delivered to the lenders), will be sufficient to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facilities and fund our working capital needs, committed and planned capital expenditures, development opportunities and debt obligations. in the normal course of our activities, we will continue to evaluate global capital markets to consider future opportunities for enhancements of our capital structure. during the year ended december 31, 2022, scl drew down $114 million and hkd 8.50 billion (approximately $1.09 billion at exchange rates in effect on december 31, 2022) under the scl revolving facility for general corporate purposes.
table of contents we have suspended our quarterly dividend program beginning in april 2020, and scl suspended its dividend payments after paying its interim dividend for 2019 on february 21, 2020.
we believe we have a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity in place, including access to available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities. we also believe we are well positioned to support our continuing operations, complete the major construction projects underway, meet our commitments under the macao concession and respond to the current covid-19 pandemic challenges. we have taken various mitigating measures to manage through the current environment, including a cost and capital expenditure reduction program to minimize cash outflow for non-essential items.
share repurchase program in june 2018, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of $2.50 billion of our outstanding common stock, which was to expire in november 2020. in october 2020, our board of directors authorized the extension of the expiration date of the remaining repurchase amount of $916 million to november 2022 and in october 2022, our board of directors authorized the further extension of the expiration date of the remaining repurchase amount of $916 million to november 2024. during the year ended december 31, 2022, no shares of our common stock were repurchased under this program. all share repurchases of our common stock have been recorded as treasury stock. repurchases of our common stock are made at our discretion in accordance with applicable federal securities laws in the open market or otherwise. the timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including our financial position, earnings, cash flows, legal requirements, other investment opportunities and market conditions.

(1)as of december 31, 2022, we had a $100 million liability related to uncertain tax positions. we do not expect this liability to result in a payment of cash within the next 12 months. we are unable to reasonably table of contents estimate the timing of the liability in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions; therefore, such amounts are not included in the table.
(2)see "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 12 - long-term debt" for further details on these financing transactions and "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 16 - leases" for further details on finance leases.
(4)based on the 1-month rate as of december 31, 2022, secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") of 4.30%, hong kong inter-bank offer rate ("hibor") of 4.35% and singapore swap offer rate ("sor") of 2.53%, plus the applicable interest rate spread in accordance with the respective debt agreements.
(5)in addition to the amounts listed in the table above, under the macao concession, we have committed to spend 30.24 billion patacas (approximately $3.77 billion at exchange rates in effect on december 31, 2022) through 2032 on both capital and operating projects, including 27.80 billion patacas (approximately $3.46 billion at exchange rates in effect on december 31, 2022) in non-gaming projects. we will be required to increase our investment in non-gaming projects by up to 20% in the following year subject to a trigger, namely if macao's annual market gross gaming revenue achieves or exceeds 180 billion patacas (approximately $22.42 billion at exchange rates in effect on december 31, 2022). the 20% increase is subject to a deduction of 4% per year if the revenue trigger occurs on or after 2028 (the sixth year of the term of the concession). this potential additional investment is estimated to be approximately $700 million. as the exact timing of this spend has not been finalized, these amounts have not been included in the table above.
we are also required to pay a 35% gross gaming revenue special gaming tax and a 5% gross gaming revenue contribution in macao, which amounts we pay are variable in nature. under the concession, however, we are obligated to pay a special annual gaming premium if the average of the gross gaming revenues of our gaming tables and our electrical or mechanical gaming machines, including slot machines, is lower than a certain minimum amount determined by the macao government; such special premium being the difference between the gaming tax based on the actual gross gaming revenues and that of the specified minimum amount. based on the maximum number of gaming tables and gaming machines we are currently authorized to operate, if the monthly special gaming taxes paid during the year aggregates to less than 4.50 billion patacas (approximately $561 million at exchange rates in effect on december 31, 2022), we would be required to pay the difference as the special annual gaming premium.
(6)we are required to pay an annual premium with a fixed portion and a variable portion, which is based on the number and type of gaming tables and gaming machines we operate. based on the gaming tables and gaming machines (which is at the maximum number of tables and machines currently allowed by the macao government) in operation as of january 1, 2023, the annual premium payable to the macao government is approximately $41 million for the years ending december 31, 2023 through december 31, 2027, respectively, and $203 million in aggregate thereafter through the termination of the concession in december 2032.
(7)under the handover record, we are required to make annual payments of 750 patacas per square meter for the first three years and 2,500 patacas per square meter for the following seven years (approximately $93 and $311, respectively, at exchange rates in effect on december 31, 2022). the annual payment of 750 patacas per square meter will be adjusted with the macao average price index of the corresponding preceding year for years two and three and the annual payment of 2,500 patacas per square meter will be adjusted with the macao average price index of the corresponding preceding year for years five through ten.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. these estimates and judgments are based on historical information, information currently available to us and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could vary from those estimates and we may change our estimates and assumptions in future evaluations. changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. we believe the critical accounting policies discussed below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
table of contents provision for expected credit losses we maintain a provision for expected credit losses on casino, hotel and mall receivables and regularly evaluate the balances. we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances, which are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and days past due. the reserve percentages are based on estimated loss rates supported by historical observed default rates over the expected life of the receivable and are adjusted for forward-looking information. we also specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over a specified dollar amount, based upon the age of the account, the customer's financial condition, collection history and any other known information and adjust the aforementioned reserve with the results from the individual reserve analysis. we also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts, which include the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, in our evaluation of the adequacy of the recorded reserves.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, there continued to be a delay in payments on casino receivables due to the inability of patrons to travel to our properties or to accomplish financial transactions due to the travel restrictions caused by the covid-19 pandemic. the collection of casino receivables has also been impacted by liquidity issues faced by certain patrons also stemming from the covid-19 pandemic. we have increased the provision for credit losses where appropriate to account for the expected credit losses due to the covid-19 pandemic. we continue to closely monitor any delays in payments due to the covid-19 pandemic and will increase the provision accordingly depending on the facts and circumstances. although we believe the provision on our casino receivables is adequate as of december 31, 2022, it is possible our provisions could increase if we experience further delays on payments from patrons.
account balances are written off against the provision when we believe it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. credit or marker play was 9.8% and 15.8% of table games play at our macao properties and marina bay sands, respectively, during the year ended december 31, 2022. our provision for casino credit losses was 61.6% and 72.5% of gross casino receivables as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the credit extended to gaming promoters can be offset by the commissions payable to said gaming promoters, which is considered in the establishment of the provision for credit losses. our provision for credit losses from our hotel and other receivables is not material.
litigation accrual we are subject to various claims and legal actions. we estimate the accruals for these claims and legal actions based on all relevant facts and circumstances currently available and include such accruals in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets when it is determined such contingencies are both probable and reasonably estimable.
property and equipment as of december 31, 2022, we had net property and equipment of $11.45 billion, representing 52.0% of our total assets. we depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. the estimated useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as current operating strategy and legal considerations, such as contractual life. future events, such as property expansions, property developments, new competition or new regulations, could result in a change in the manner in which we use certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets. the estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a prospective basis.
for assets to be held and used (including projects under development), fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. if an indicator of impairment exists, we first group our assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (the "asset group"). secondly, we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows directly associated with and expected to arise from the completion, use and eventual disposition of such asset group. we estimate the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group. if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is measured based on fair value compared to carrying value, with fair value typically based on a discounted cash flow model. if an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs.
table of contents to estimate the undiscounted cash flows of our asset groups, we consider all potential cash flows scenarios, which are probability weighted based on management's estimates given current conditions. determining the recoverability of our asset groups is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including estimated cash flows, probability weighting of potential scenarios, costs to complete construction for assets under development, growth rates and future market conditions, among others. future changes to our estimates and assumptions based upon changes in macro-economic factors, regulatory environments, operating results or management's intentions may result in future changes to the recoverability of our asset groups.
for assets to be held for sale, the fixed assets (the "disposal group") are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. losses are recognized for any initial or subsequent write-down to fair value less costs to sell, while gains are recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell, but not in excess of the cumulative loss previously recognized. any gains or losses not previously recognized that result from the sale of the disposal group shall be recognized at the date of sale. fixed assets are not depreciated while classified as held for sale.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. (including federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. we record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
our foreign and u.s. tax rate differential reflects the fact that u.s. tax rates are higher than the statutory tax rates in singapore and macao of 17% and 12%, respectively. in august 2018, we received an exemption from macao's corporate income tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games of chance for the period of january 1, 2019 through june 26, 2022. in september 2022, we received an additional extension of this exemption for the period june 27, 2022 through december 31, 2022. additionally, we entered into an agreement with the macao government in april 2019, effective through june 26, 2022, providing for payments as a substitution for a 12% tax otherwise due from vml shareholders on dividend distributions paid from vml gaming profits, namely a payment of 38 million patacas (approximately $5 million at exchange rates in effect on december 31, 2022) for each of the years 2021 and 2020, each payment to be made on or before january 31 of the following year, and a payment of 18 million patacas (approximately $2 million at exchange rates in effect on december 31, 2022) for the period between january 1, 2022 through june 26, 2022, to be paid on or before july 26, 2022. in december 2022, we requested a corporate tax exemption on profits generated by the operation of casino games in macao for the new concession period effective from january 1, 2023 through december 31, 2032, or for a period of corporate tax exemption that the chief executive of macao may deem more appropriate. we are evaluating the timing of an application for a new shareholder dividend tax agreement. there is no certainty either of these tax arrangements will be granted.
accounting standards regarding income taxes require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if based on the available evidence, it is "more-likely-than-not" such assets will not be realized. accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting period based on a "more-likely-than-not" realization threshold. this assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring and tax planning strategies.
we recorded a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions of $475 million and $416 million as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets of our u.s. operations of $3.61 billion and $4.62 billion as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. management will reassess the realization of deferred tax assets each reporting period and consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, sources of taxable income and tax planning strategies. to the extent the financial results of these operations improve and it becomes "more-likely-than-not" the deferred tax assets are realizable, we will be able to reduce the valuation allowance in the period such determination is made, as appropriate.
table of contents significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. during the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. accounting standards regarding uncertainty in income taxes provides a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is "more-likely-than-not" the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely, based solely on the technical merits, of being sustained on examinations. we recorded unrecognized tax benefits of $136 million as of december 31, 2022 and 2021. we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may be different.
our major tax jurisdictions are the u.s., macao, and singapore. we could be subject to examination for tax years beginning in 2018 in macao and singapore and tax years 2010 through 2015 and 2019 through 2021 in the u.s.

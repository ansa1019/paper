nim was 3.01% for 2022, up 15 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to higher market interest rates and well controlled deposit costs. the growth in nim was negatively impacted by lower purchase accounting accretion, which benefited nim by 13 basis points in 2022 compared to 26 basis points in 2021. the te yield on the total loan portfolio for 2022 was 4.36%, up 41 basis points. the te yield on the average securities portfolio was 1.88%, up 38 basis points. the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.42%, up 36 basis points. the average cost of total deposits was 0.27%, up 23 basis points. the average cost of long-term debt was 2.31%, up 78 basis points. the increases in rates on assets and liabilities reflects the rising rate environment during 2022.
the provision for credit losses was $777 million, compared to a benefit of $813 million for the prior year. the current year reflects strong loan growth and a moderate decline in the alll ratio, whereas the prior year included reserve releases due to the improving economic environment during that period. net charge-offs were $823 million, compared to $697 million for the prior year. the net charge-off ratio for the current year of 0.27% was up three basis points compared to the earlier year primarily driven by normalizing trends across certain consumer portfolios, partially offset by lower charge offs in the commercial and industrial portfolio.
noninterest expense decreased $527 million, or 3.5%, compared to the prior year. excluding the aforementioned items and the impact of amortization expense for intangibles, noninterest expense increased $380 million, or 3.0%, driven by higher professional fees, operational losses, expenses related to acquired companies and marketing expenses, partially offset by lower occupancy and equipment expenses.
the provision for income taxes was $1.4 billion for 2022, compared to $1.6 billion to 2021. the effective tax rate for 2022 was 18.3%, compared to 19.5% for the prior year. the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by higher favorable permanent tax items and an increase in discrete tax benefits.

as of december 31, 2022, the cet1 ratio was 9.0% and the average lcr was 112%. the 60 basis point decline in the cet1 ratio compared to december 31, 2021 primarily reflects strong loan growth, acquisitions, and the impact from the phase-in of the cecl transition relief.
on february 16, 2023, the company entered into an agreement to sell a 20% stake of the common equity in truist insurance holdings, a subsidiary of truist and the sixth-largest insurance brokerage in the u.s., for $1.95 billion to an investor group led by stone point capital, llc. the closing of the investment is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. the transaction allows truist to maintain strategic flexibility and future upside in truist insurance holdings, which will continue to benefit from truist's operations, access to capital, and client relationships. truist will also preserve and enhance its client service approach to offering leading insurance products to its banking clients. moreover, truist insurance holdings gains an experienced partner in stone point, which brings deep industry expertise and access to capital to help accelerate truist insurance holdings' growth. upon closing of the transaction, a five-person board will be formed to oversee truist insurance holdings, comprising four members appointed by truist and one member appointed by stone point.
key areas of focus truist's business is dynamic and complex. consequently, management annually evaluates and, as necessary, adjusts the company's business strategy in the context of the current operating environment. during this process, management considers the current financial condition and performance of the company and its expectations for future economic activity from both a national and local market perspective. achieving key strategic objectives and long-term financial goals is subject to many uncertainties and challenges. in the opinion of management, the following are the key areas of focus most likely to impact truist's near to medium term performance:
•actualizing our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities and driving executional excellence to realize our potential;
•digitizing the enterprise through our "t3 strategy" to create a world-class client experience and streamline, simplify, and automate processes and operations; and
•making truist a great place to work through our purpose-driven and inclusive culture, competitive compensation and benefits, and compelling career development and growth opportunities.
in addition, certain other challenges and unforeseen events could have a near term impact on truist's financial condition and results of operations. see the sections titled "forward-looking statements" and "risk factors" for additional examples of such challenges.

noninterest income noninterest income is a significant contributor to truist's financial results. management focuses on diversifying its sources of revenue to reduce truist's reliance on traditional spread-based interest income, as certain fee-based activities are a relatively stable revenue source during periods of changing interest rates. during 2022, the company reclassified certain line items within noninterest income. see "note 1. basis of presentation" for additional details. the following table provides a breakdown of truist's noninterest income:
service charges on deposits                                                                                        1,026                    1,060                   1,020                     (3.2)                           3.9

noninterest income for the year ended december 31, 2022 decreased $571 million, or 6.1%, compared to the prior year. the current year includes net securities losses of $71 million and the gain on the redemption of noncontrolling equity interest (other income) of $74 million. the earlier year included a gain of $37 million from the divestiture of certain businesses (other income). excluding the aforementioned items, noninterest income was down $537 million, or 5.8%, compared to the prior year. investment banking and trading income decreased $446 million, or 31%, due to lower capital markets activity and lower merger and acquisition fees. mortgage banking income decreased $274 million, or 37%, as lower production income (due to lower margins and refinance volumes resulting from the higher rate environment) was partially offset by higher residential servicing income (due to lower prepayments and servicing portfolio purchases). excluding the aforementioned gains, other income decreased $237 million, or 46%, primarily due to valuation changes from assets held for certain post-retirement benefits, which is primarily offset by lower personnel expense, lower investment income and valuation marks from the company's sbic and other strategic investments and lower derivative trading income. wealth management income decreased $54 million, or 3.9%, primarily due to lower market valuations. insurance income increased $416 million, or 16%, due to acquisitions and continued organic growth. card and payment related fees increased $70 million, or 8.0%, due to the first quarter 2022 acquisition of certain merchant services relationships and increased activity.
noninterest expense during 2022, the company reclassified certain line items within noninterest expense. see "note 1. basis of presentation" for additional details. the following table provides a breakdown of truist's noninterest expense:
noninterest expense for the year ended december 31, 2022 was down $527 million, or 3.5%, compared to the earlier year. merger-related and restructuring charges decreased $309 million due to diminishing integration-related activities and lower costs in connection with the voluntary separation and retirement program, partially offset by higher costs for client day one conversions. incremental operating expenses related to the merger decreased $306 million, primarily reflecting lower personnel and professional fees and outside processing expenses. the current year includes a $39 million gain on the redemption of fhlb advances (other expense). the prior year includes $200 million for charitable contributions to the truist foundation and the truist charitable fund (other expense), $36 million of expense associated with an acceleration of loss recognition related to certain terminated cash flow hedges (other expense), a $30 million professional fee to develop an ongoing program to identify, prioritize, and roadmap teammate generated revenue growth and expense savings opportunities beyond the merger, and a small gain on the extinguishment of debt (other expense).
excluding the aforementioned items and the amortization of intangibles, adjusted noninterest expense increased $380 million, or 3.0%, compared to the earlier year. other expense was down $61 million, but was up $217 million, or 39%, on an adjusted basis primarily due to increased operational losses and teammate travel expenses. professional fees and outside processing expenses were down $31 million, but up $173 million, or 20%, on an adjusted basis due to increased project spend for enterprise technology investments and increased call center staffing. marketing and customer development expense increased $58 million ($66 million, or 23% on an adjusted basis) due to increased spend to continue to build and strengthen truist's brand. net occupancy expense decreased $20 million ($47 million, or 6.2% on an adjusted basis) primarily due to consolidations of branches and other facilities. equipment expense decreased $35 million ($41 million, or 8.2% on an adjusted basis) primarily due to laptop purchases in the prior year. personnel expense decreased $165 million, or 1.9% ($18 million, or 0.2% on an adjusted basis) due to lower other post-retirement benefit expense, which is almost entirely offset by lower other income, lower incentives expenses, and lower defined benefit costs, partially offset by higher salaries due to additional personnel costs for acquisitions, annual merit increases, and investments in revenue producing businesses and enterprise technology, and higher medical claims.
•severance and personnel-related costs or credits;
•occupancy and equipment charges or credits, which relate to costs or gains associated with lease terminations, obsolete equipment write-offs and the sale of duplicate facilities and equipment;
•professional services, which relate to legal and investment banking advisory fees and other consulting services pertaining to restructuring initiatives or transactions;
•systems conversion and related charges, which represent costs to integrate the entity's information technology systems;
•other merger-related and restructuring charges or credits, which include expenses necessary to convert and combine the acquired branches and operations of merged companies, direct media advertising related to the mergers and acquisitions, asset and supply inventory write-offs, and other similar charges; and

46 truist financial corporation merger-related and restructuring accruals are established when the costs are incurred or once all requirements for a plan to dispose of or outsource certain business functions have been approved by management. merger and restructuring accruals are re-evaluated periodically and adjusted as necessary. the remaining accruals at december 31, 2022 are generally expected to be utilized within one year, unless they relate to specific contracts that expire later.
the following table presents a summary of merger-related and restructuring charges and the related accruals. the 2022 and 2021 merger-related and restructuring costs primarily reflect charges as a result of the merger, including costs for severance and other benefits, costs related to exiting facilities, and other restructuring initiatives.
table 12: merger-related and restructuring accrual activity
(1)related to the merger, the company recognized $368 million of expense for the year ended december 31, 2022. at december 31, 2022, the company had an accrual of $19 million related to the merger. the remaining expense and accrual relate to other restructuring activities.
segment results truist operates and measures business activity across three segments: consumer banking and wealth, corporate and commercial banking, and insurance holdings, with functional activities included in other, treasury, and corporate. the company's business segment structure is based on the manner in which financial information is evaluated by management as well as the products and services provided or the type of client served.
the segment results are presented based on internal management methodologies that were designed to support these strategic objectives. unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to gaap. the application and development of management reporting methodologies is an active process and undergoes periodic enhancements. the implementation of these enhancements to the internal management reporting methodology may materially affect the results disclosed for each segment, with no impact on consolidated results. when significant changes to management reporting methodologies take place, the impact of these changes is quantified and prior period information is revised.
prior period results have been revised to reflect management reporting methodology changes resulting from the integration of heritage bb&t and heritage suntrust measurement processes and systems. changes primarily relate to funds transfer pricing and internal equity allocations. the changes impacted 2021 and 2020 segment net interest income reported in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in the annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2021. cb&w, c&cb, and ih increased $868 million, $566 million, and $15 million, respectively, for 2021 and increased $117 million, $375 million, and $15 million, respectively, for 2020. these increases were offset with decreases in ot&c of $1.4 billion for 2021 and $507 million for 2020.
see "note 21. operating segments" for additional disclosures related to truist's operating segments, including the internal accounting and reporting practices used to manage these segments.
consumer banking and wealth cb&w net income was $3.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, an increase of $15 million, or 0.4%, compared to the prior year. segment net interest income increased $975 million primarily due to favorable funding credit on deposits attributable to the higher rate environment and higher average loan and deposit balances, partially offset by decreased loan spreads and lower purchase accounting accretion. the allocated provision for credit losses increased $717 million primarily due to a reserve release in the prior year as well as loan growth and a moderately slower economic outlook in the current year. noninterest income decreased $274 million primarily due to a decrease in residential mortgage income. noninterest expense decreased $94 million primarily due to lower net occupancy and incentive expenses as well as lower merger-related and restructuring charges, partially offset by increased operational losses.
cb&w average total deposits increased $8.9 billion, or 3.7%, for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to increases in average noninterest bearing deposits, money market and savings, and interest bearing checking, partially offset by a decline in time deposits.
truist wealth had assets under management of $180.4 billion as of december 31, 2022, a decrease of $29.2 billion, or 14%, compared to the prior year primarily due to market declines, partially offset by positive organic growth in assets under management.
corporate and commercial banking c&cb net income was $4.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $435 million, or 9.0%, compared to the prior year. segment net interest income increased $740 million primarily due to higher funding credit on deposits and increases to noninterest bearing deposit balances, partially offset by lower purchase accounting accretion and lower fee income associated with ppp loan forgiveness. the allocated provision for credit losses increased $786 million which reflects lower allowance releases in the current year compared to the prior year, partially offset by lower net charge-offs in the current year. noninterest income decreased $513 million primarily due lower investment banking revenue. noninterest expense decreased $31 million primarily due to lower incentive expense tied to lower revenues and lower professional fees as well as lower merger-related and restructuring charges, partially offset by investments in revenue producers.
c&cb average total deposits decreased $1.9 billion, or 1.3%, for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in average interest bearing deposits, partially offset by an increase in noninterest bearing deposits.
insurance holdings ih net income was $546 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, an increase of $16 million, or 3.0%, compared to the prior year. noninterest income increased $441 million, or 17%, primarily due to acquisitions and organic growth. noninterest expense increased $425 million, or 20%, primarily due to investments in new hires and teammates, performance-driven incentive expense, higher merger-related charges related to acquisitions, and an increase in travel and entertainment expense.
48 truist financial corporation other, treasury, and corporate ot&c generated a net loss of $2.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to a net loss of $2.7 billion in the prior year. segment net interest income decreased $435 million due to higher funding credit on deposits to other segments, partially offset by higher funds transfer charges to other segments for loans and higher earnings in the securities portfolio from the higher rate environment. the allocated provision for credit losses increased $80 million, which reflects a build in the reserve for unfunded commitments in the current year compared to a release in the prior year. noninterest income decreased $225 million primarily due to valuation changes from assets held for certain post-retirement benefits, which is primarily offset by lower personnel expense, and losses on the sale of securities in the current year. noninterest expense decreased $827 million primarily due to lower personnel expense, charitable contributions to the truist foundation and the truist charitable fund in the prior year, and lower merger-related and restructuring charges and incremental operating expenses related to the merger.
analysis of financial condition investment activities truist's board-approved investment policy is carried out by the mrlcc, which meets regularly to review the economic environment and establish investment strategies. the mrlcc also has much broader responsibilities, which are discussed in the "market risk" section in md&a.
investment strategies are reviewed by the mrlcc based on the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix, actual and anticipated loan demand, funding opportunities and the overall interest rate sensitivity of the company. in general, the goals of the investment portfolio are: (i) to provide sufficient liquid assets to meet unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations and overall funds management objectives; (ii) to provide eligible securities to secure public funds, trust deposits and other borrowings; and (iii) to earn an optimal return on funds invested commensurate with meeting the requirements of (i) and (ii) and consistent with the company's risk appetite.
truist bank invests in securities allowable under bank regulations. these securities may include obligations of the u.s. treasury, u.s. government agencies, gses (including mbs), bank eligible obligations of any state or political subdivision, non-agency mbs, structured notes, bank eligible corporate obligations (including corporate debentures), commercial paper, negotiable cds, bankers' acceptances, mutual funds, and limited types of equity securities.

the securities portfolio totaled $129.5 billion at december 31, 2022, compared to $154.6 billion at december 31, 2021. the decrease includes paydowns and maturities of $20.8 billion, as well as market declines of $14.0 billion, partially offset by purchases of $10.1 billion. in the first quarter of 2022, truist transferred $59.4 billion of afs securities to htm as the company continues to execute upon its asset-liability management strategies. as of december 31, 2022, 41% of the investment securities portfolio was classified as held-to-maturity based on amortized cost.
as of december 31, 2022, approximately 5.6% of the securities portfolio was variable rate, excluding the impact of swaps, compared to 4.6% as of december 31, 2021. the effective duration of the securities portfolio was 6.7 years at december 31, 2022, compared to 5.8 years at december 31, 2021, excluding the impact of unsettled security purchases at period end. the increase in duration was driven by higher rates, resulting in slower prepayments and longer average lives for the mbs portfolio.
u.s. treasury, gse, and agency mbs represents 97% of the total securities portfolio as of december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021. while the overwhelming majority of the portfolio remains in agency mbs securities, the company also holds aaa rated non-agency mbs as the risk adjusted returns for these securities are more attractive than agency mbs.

50 truist financial corporation lending activities truist strives to meet the credit needs of its clients while pursuing a balanced strategy of loan profitability, loan growth, and loan quality. management believes that this purpose can best be accomplished by building strong client relationships over time and developing in-depth local market knowledge. the company employs strict underwriting criteria governing the degree of risk assumed and the diversity of the loan portfolio in terms of type, industry, and geographical concentration.
truist lends to a diverse client base that is geographically dispersed to mitigate concentration risk arising from local and regional economic downturns. the following discussion provides additional information on the company's loan and lease portfolios. refer to the "risk management" section for a discussion of the credit risk management policies used to manage the portfolios.
commercial loan and lease portfolio commercial loans and leases represent the largest category of the company's loan and lease portfolio. commercial community banking generally targets small-to-middle market businesses with annual sales between $2 million and $500 million, while cib provides lending solutions to large corporate clients. the commercial loan and lease portfolio consists of lending to public and private business clients and is composed of commercial and industrial, owner occupied, equipment leasing and financing, commercial real estate, government and institutional financing, and premium financing in accordance with the company's lending policy, each commercial loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process. commercial loans are typically priced with an interest rate tied to market indices, such as the prime rate or sofr and are individually monitored and reviewed for deterioration in the ability of the client to repay the loan. the majority of truist's commercial loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventories, and other types of collateral.
residential mortgage loan portfolio truist primarily originates conforming mortgage loans, loans under fha, u.s. department of veterans affairs, or u.s. department of agriculture programs, and higher quality jumbo and construction-to-permanent loans for 1-4 family residential properties. conforming loans are loans that are underwritten in accordance with the underwriting standards set forth by fnma and fhlmc. they are generally collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate, typically have loan-to-collateral value ratios of 80% or less at origination, or have mortgage insurance as required by investors and are made to borrowers in good credit standing.
risks associated with mortgage lending include interest rate risk, which is mitigated through the sale of a substantial portion of conforming fixed-rate loans in the secondary mortgage market and an effective msr hedging process. credit risk is managed through rigorous underwriting procedures and mortgage insurance. the right to service the loans and receive servicing income is generally retained when conforming loans are sold. management believes that the retention of mortgage servicing diversifies income while enabling truist to build long-term client relationships and offer high quality client service. truist also purchases residential mortgage loans from correspondent originators. the loans purchased from third-party originators are subject to substantially the same underwriting and risk-management criteria as loans originated internally.
residential home equity and direct loan portfolio the residential home equity and direct loan portfolio is composed of a wide variety of secured and unsecured loans offered through truist's branch network, as well as loans originated by lightstream, truist's national online consumer lending division. loans originated through the truist branch network include revolving home equity lines of credit secured by first or second liens on residential real estate and certain other secured and unsecured lending marketed to qualifying clients and other creditworthy candidates in truist's market areas. lightstream provides fixed-rate, unsecured lending to consumers with strong credit through its proprietary online loan origination system.
indirect auto loan portfolio the indirect auto portfolio primarily includes secured indirect installment loans to consumers for the purchase of new and used automobiles. the indirect auto portfolio also includes nonprime and near prime automobile finance. such loans are originated through approved franchised and independent dealers throughout the truist market area and nationally through regional acceptance corporation. these loans are relatively homogeneous, and no single loan is individually significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. indirect auto loans are subject to rigorous lending policies and procedures and are underwritten with note amounts and credit limits that are consistent with the company's risk philosophy. in addition to its normal underwriting due diligence, truist uses application systems and scoring systems to help underwrite and manage the credit risk in its indirect auto portfolio.
indirect other loan portfolio the indirect other portfolio includes secured indirect installment loans to consumers for the purchase of new and used boats and recreational vehicles. the indirect other portfolio also includes small ticket consumer lending related to the purchase of power sports and outdoor power equipment, and trailers. these loans are relatively homogeneous, and no single loan is individually significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. these loans are subject to similar rigorous lending policies and procedures as the indirect auto loan portfolio. the indirect other loan portfolio also includes other indirect and point-of-sale lending to consumers to finance home improvements, furniture purchases, certain elective health-care services, and other consumer products segments. these loans are originated in accordance with strict underwriting criteria as determined by truist.
student loan portfolio the student loan portfolio is primarily composed of government guaranteed student loans and additionally includes certain private student loans originated by third parties. the government guarantee mitigates substantially all of the risk related to principal and interest repayment for this component of the portfolio. private student loans were purchased from third-party originators with credit enhancements that partially mitigate the company's credit exposure.
credit card loan portfolio the credit card portfolio consists of the outstanding balances on credit cards. truist markets credit cards to its existing client base and does not solicit cardholders through nationwide programs or other forms of mass marketing. such balances are generally unsecured and actively managed.

commercial loans increased $25.1 billion during 2022 primarily due to broad-based growth within the commercial and industrial portfolio and the bankdirect acquisition, which added $3.1 billion of loans on november 1, 2022. these increases were partially offset by a $1.9 billion decline in ppp loans.
consumer loans, including credit cards, increased $11.3 billion during 2022 primarily due to an $8.8 billion increase in residential mortgages due to correspondent channel production and lower prepayments, a $2.1 billion increase in indirect other primarily due to growth from service finance, recreational lending, and sheffield portfolios, partially offset by runoff in other partnership lending programs, and a $1.5 billion increase in indirect auto primarily in the prime auto segment. these increases were partially offset by $1.5 billion runoff in student loans.
52 truist financial corporation the following table presents a summary of the loans and leases by scheduled repayment period and interest rate terms. determinations of maturities are based on scheduled repayments, except when rollovers or extensions are included for purposes of measuring the acl. truist's credit policy typically does not permit automatic renewal of loans. at the scheduled maturity date (including balloon payment date), the client generally must request a new loan to replace the matured loan and execute either a new note or note modification with rate, terms and conditions negotiated at that time.

certain residential mortgage loans have an initial period where the borrower is only required to pay the periodic interest. after the interest-only period, the loan will require the payment of both interest and principal over the remaining term. the outstanding balances of variable rate residential mortgage loans in the interest-only phase were approximately $342 million and $288 million at december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, respectively.

average loans and leases held for investment for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $320.7 billion, up $11.3 billion, or 3.6%, compared to the third quarter of 2022. the company added $3.1 billion of loans in conjunction with the acquisition of bankdirect on november 1, 2022, which contributed $2.1 billion of average loan growth for the fourth quarter of 2022. excluding the acquisition, average loans and leases held for investment increased $9.2 billion, or 3.0% compared to the third quarter of 2022.
average commercial loans increased $7.9 billion, or 4.4%, due to broad-based growth within the commercial and industrial portfolio and the bankdirect acquisition.
average consumer loans increased $3.3 billion, or 2.7%, due to a $3.0 billion increase in residential mortgages due to correspondent channel production and lower prepayments. in addition, indirect other increased $548 million primarily due to growth from the service finance, recreational lending, and sheffield portfolios, partially offset by runoff in other partnership lending programs. these increases were partially offset by $425 million runoff in student loans.

(2)this asset quality ratio has been adjusted to remove the impact of government guaranteed loans. management believes the inclusion of such assets in this asset quality ratio results in distortion of this ratio because collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured, or the ratio might not be comparable to other periods presented or to other portfolios that do not have government guarantees.

truist monitors the performance of its home equity loans and lines secured by second liens similarly to other consumer loans and utilizes assumptions specific to these loans in determining the necessary alll. truist also receives notification when the first lien holder, whether truist or another financial institution, has initiated foreclosure proceedings against the borrower. when notified that the first lien is in the process of foreclosure, truist obtains valuations to determine if any additional charge-offs or reserves are warranted. these valuations are updated at least annually thereafter.
truist has limited ability to monitor the delinquency status of the first lien, unless the first lien is held or serviced by truist. truist estimates credit losses on second lien loans where the first lien is delinquent based on historical experience; the increased risk of loss on these credits is reflected in the alll. as of december 31, 2022, truist held or serviced the first lien on 32% of its second lien positions.

funding activities deposits are the primary source of funds for the company's lending and investing activities. scheduled payments and maturities from portfolios of loans and investment securities also provide a stable source of funds. fhlb advances, other secured borrowings, federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowed funds, as well as long-term debt issued through the capital markets, all provide supplemental liquidity sources. funding activities are monitored and governed through truist's overall alm process under the governance and oversight of the mrlcc, which is further discussed in the "market risk" section in md&a. the following section provides a brief description of the various sources of funds.
deposits deposits are obtained principally from individuals and businesses within truist's geographic area and include noninterest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, cds, and iras. deposit account terms vary with respect to the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit and service charge schedules. interest rates paid on specific deposit types are determined based on (i) competitor deposit rates, (ii) the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs, (iii) the availability and cost of alternative sources of funding, and (iv) anticipated future economic conditions and interest rates. deposits are attractive sources of funding because of their stability and relative cost.
the following table presents a summary of deposits:

deposits totaled $413.5 billion at december 31, 2022, a decrease of $3.0 billion from december 31, 2021. the decline in deposits reflects the impacts of monetary tightening, inflation, and higher interest rate alternatives, partially offset by growth in time deposits, which reflects increases in various wholesale deposit products to support funding.
the amount of deposits above the fdic's limit of $250,000 was $189.6 billion and $202.5 billion as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, calculated using the same methodology as the call report for truist bank. the following table summarizes the maturities of time deposit accounts above $250,000:

average deposits for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $413.3 billion, a decrease of $6.8 billion, or 1.6%, compared to the prior quarter. the decrease in deposits was primarily driven by the impacts of monetary tightening, inflation, and higher interest rate alternatives. average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 3.4% compared to the prior quarter and represented 34.1% of total deposits for the fourth quarter of 2022. average money market and savings and interest checking declined 2.0% and 1.5%, respectively, compared to the prior quarter. average time deposits increased 19% primarily due to an increase in wholesale time deposit products.
60 truist financial corporation borrowings the types of short-term borrowings that have been, or may be, used by the company include federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, master notes, commercial paper, short-term bank notes, and short-term fhlb advances. short-term borrowings fluctuate based on the company's funding needs. while deposits remain the primary source for funding loan originations, management uses short-term borrowings as a supplementary funding source for loan growth and other balance sheet management purposes. the following table summarizes certain information for the past three years with respect to short-term borrowings excluding trading liabilities, hedges, and collateral in excess of derivative exposure:
securities sold under agreements to repurchase:
long-term debt provides funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital, and primarily consists of senior and subordinated notes issued by truist and truist bank. long-term debt totaled $43.2 billion at december 31, 2022, an increase of $7.3 billion compared to december 31, 2021. during the year ended december 31, 2022, the company had maturities and redemptions of $5.9 billion of senior and $300 million of subordinated long-term debt and redeemed $800 million of fhlb advances, which resulted in a gain on early extinguishment of long-term debt of $39 million. the company issued $3.9 billion fixed-to-floating rate senior notes with an interest rate between 4.12% and 6.12% due july 28, 2026 to october 28, 2033 and $1.0 billion fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes with an interest rate of 4.92% due july 28, 2033. additionally, truist issued $10.8 billion notional of fhlb floating rate advances. the average cost of long-term debt was 2.31% for the year ended december 31, 2022, up 78 basis points compared to the same period in 2021.
in january 2023, truist issued $1.5 billion fixed-to-floating rate senior notes with an interest rate of 4.87% due january 26, 2029 and $1.5 billion fixed-to-floating rate senior notes with an interest rate of 5.12% due january 26, 2034.
shareholders' equity total shareholders' equity was $60.5 billion at december 31, 2022, a decrease of $8.7 billion from december 31, 2021. this decline includes a decrease of $12.0 billion in aoci and $3.0 billion in dividends, partially offset by $6.3 billion in net income. truist's book value per common share at december 31, 2022 was $40.58, compared to $47.14 at december 31, 2021.
risk management truist maintains a comprehensive risk management framework supported by people, processes, and systems to identify, measure, monitor, manage, and report significant risks arising from its exposures and business activities. effective risk management involves optimizing risk and return while operating in a safe and sound manner, and promoting compliance with applicable laws and regulations. the company's risk management framework promotes the execution of business strategies and objectives in alignment with its risk appetite.
truist has developed and employs a risk framework that further guides business functions in identifying, measuring, responding to, monitoring, and reporting on possible exposures to the organization. the risk taxonomy drives internal risk measurement and monitoring and enables truist to clearly and transparently communicate to stakeholders the level of potential risk the company faces and the company's position on managing risk to acceptable levels.
truist is committed to fostering a culture that supports identification and escalation of risks across the organization. all teammates are responsible for upholding the company's purpose, mission, and values, and are encouraged to speak up if there is any activity or behavior that is inconsistent with the company's culture. the truist code of ethics guides the company's decision making and informs teammates on how to act in the absence of specific guidance.
truist seeks an appropriate return for the risk taken in its business operations. risk-taking activities are evaluated and prioritized to identify those that present attractive risk-adjusted returns, while preserving asset value and capital.
truist's compensation plans are designed to consider teammate's adherence to and successful implementation of truist's risk values and associated policies and procedures. the company's compensation structure supports its core values and sound risk management practices in an effort to promote judicious risk-taking behavior.
truist's purpose, mission, and values are the foundation for the risk management framework utilized at truist and therefore serve as the basis on which the risk appetite and risk strategy are built. truist's rmo provides independent oversight and guidance for risk-taking across the enterprise. in keeping with the belief that consistent values drive long-term behaviors, truist's rmo has established the following risk values which guide teammates' day-to-day activities:
•managing risk is the responsibility of every teammate.
•proactively identifying risk and managing the inherent risks of their businesses is the responsibility of the business units.
•managing risk with a balanced approach which includes quality, profitability, and growth.
•thoroughly analyzing risk quantitatively and qualitatively.
•realizing lower cost of capital from high quality risk management.
truist places significant emphasis on risk management oversight and maintains a separate board-level risk committee, which assists the board in its oversight of the company's risk management function. the committee is responsible for approving and periodically reviewing the company's risk management framework and risk management policies as well as monitoring the company's risk profile, approving risk appetite statements, and providing input to management regarding truist's risk appetite and risk profile.
the rmo is led by the cro and is responsible for overseeing the identification, measurement, monitoring, management, and reporting of risk. the cro has direct access to the board to communicate any risk issues (current or emerging) as well as the performance of the risk management activities throughout the enterprise.
62 truist financial corporation truist's risk governance framework is designed to provide comprehensive board and executive leadership risk oversight, maintaining a committee governance structure that is designed to ensure alignment and execution of the risk management framework. the committee structure provides a mechanism to allow for efficient aggregation and escalation of risk information from the business units up to the risk programs, executive leadership and ultimately the board.
the executive level committees include the erc, ecrc, mrlcc, ebpcc, tmc, and dc, each of which is chaired by a member of executive leadership. these committees provide oversight of each of the primary risk types.
the erc establishes a fully integrated view of risks across the company, provides broad strategic oversight of all risk types, and oversees corporate-wide strategies for identifying, assessing, controlling, measuring, monitoring, and reporting risk at the enterprise level. the erc is responsible for maintaining an effective risk management framework and monitoring its adoption and execution across the enterprise. the erc is chaired by the cro, and its membership includes all members of executive leadership and the chief audit officer.
principal types of inherent risk include market, credit, liquidity, technology, compliance, strategic, reputational, and operational risks. the following is a discussion of these risks.
market risk market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios, securities, or other financial instruments. market risk results from changes in the level, volatility, or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices, including interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity, and commodity prices.
effective management of market risk is essential to achieving truist's strategic financial objectives. truist's most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet; however, market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk, price risk, and volatility risk in truist's business units. interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest-related options inherently embedded in bank products (options risk).
the primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income, net income, and capital, and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. at truist, market risk management also includes the enterprise-wide ipv function.
interest rate market risk as a financial institution, truist is exposed to interest rate risk from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet positions. to keep net interest margin as stable as possible, truist actively manages its interest rate risk exposure through the strategic repricing of its assets and liabilities, taking into account the volumes, maturities, and mix. truist primarily uses three methods to measure and monitor its interest rate risk: (i) simulations of possible changes to net interest income over the next two years based on gradual changes in interest rates; (ii) analysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and (iii) analysis of economic value of equity based on changes in interest rates.
the company's simulation model takes into account assumptions related to prepayment trends, using a combination of market data and internal historical experiences for deposits and loans, as well as scheduled maturities and payments, and the expected outlook for the economy and interest rates. these assumptions are reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect changes in current interest rates compared to the rates applicable to truist's assets and liabilities. the model also considers truist's current and prospective liquidity position, current balance sheet volumes, projected growth and/or contractions, accessibility of funds for short-term needs and capital maintenance.
deposit betas (the sensitivity of deposit rate changes relative to market rate changes) are an important assumption in the interest rate risk modeling process. truist applies deposit beta assumptions to non-maturity interest-bearing deposit accounts when determining its interest rate sensitivity. non-maturity, interest-bearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity. truist applies an average deposit beta of approximately 50% to its non-maturity interest-bearing accounts when determining its interest rate sensitivity. truist also regularly conducts sensitivity analyses on other key variables, including noninterest-bearing deposits, to determine the impact these variables could have on the company's interest rate risk position. the predictive value of the simulation model depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions, but management believes that it provides helpful information for the management of interest rate risk.

64 truist financial corporation truist has established parameters related to interest rate sensitivity measures that prescribe a maximum negative impact on net interest income under different interest rate scenarios that would result in an escalation to the board. the following parameters and interest rate scenarios are considered truist's primary measures of interest rate risk:
management considers how the interest rate risk position could be impacted by changes in balance sheet mix. liquidity in the banking industry was very strong post-covid-19, which resulted in growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. however, with the significant increase in rates in 2022, noninterest-bearing deposits have begun to disintermediate to interest-bearing accounts. additional balance movement above what is currently projected would reduce the asset sensitivity of truist's balance sheet because the company may increase interest-bearing funds to offset the loss of this advantageous funding source. alternatively, the company may reduce the size of its investment portfolio to offset the loss of noninterest-bearing demand deposits to limit the impact on the balance sheet's asset sensitivity. the behavior of these deposits is one of the most important assumptions used in determining the interest rate risk position of truist. a decrease in the amount of these deposits in the future would reduce the asset sensitivity of truist's balance sheet because the company may increase interest-bearing funds to offset the loss of this advantageous funding source.
the following table shows the results of truist's interest-rate sensitivity position assuming the loss of additional demand deposits and an associated increase in managed rate deposits versus current projections under various interest rate scenarios. for purposes of this analysis, truist modeled the incremental beta of managed rate deposits for the replacement of the demand deposits at 100%.
table 33: deposit mix sensitivity analysis gradual change in rates (bps)                          base scenario at december 31, 2022 (1)                                       results assuming a decrease in noninterest-bearing demand deposits
truist uses financial instruments including derivatives to manage interest rate risk related to securities, commercial loans, msrs, and mortgage banking operations, long-term debt, and other funding sources. truist has utilized derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients and as part of associated hedging activities. as of december 31, 2022, truist had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling $333.0 billion, with an associated net negative fair value of $2.3 billion. see "note 19. derivative financial instruments" for additional disclosures.
libor transition for most tenors of u.s. dollar libor, the administrator of libor extended publication until june 30, 2023. to prepare for the transition to an alternative reference rate, management formed a cross-functional project team to address the libor transition. the project team performed an assessment to identify the potential risks related to the transition from libor to a new index or multiple indices and provides updates to executive leadership and the board. as of december 31, 2022, truist had outstanding libor-based instruments that mature after june 30, 2023, including loan and lease exposures totaling approximately $135 billion, notional derivative exposure totaling approximately $131 billion, long-term debt of $1.1 billion, and preferred stock of $1.5 billion. these amounts are inclusive of remediated contracts, which contain adequate fallback language for the transition.
contract fallback language for existing loans and leases has largely been reviewed and certain contracts will require amendments to support the transition away from libor. impacted lines of business have started remediating these contracts to include standardized fallback language or amending contracts to new reference rates at maturities or based on client request. current fallback language used to remediate contracts that mature after june 30, 2023 is generally consistent with arrc recommendations and includes use of "hardwired fallback" language, which will transition loans to a sofr based rate after june 30, 2023.
the progress and approach to remediation will vary based on the type of contract and existing language used in the agreement. for commercial lending, a significant number of remaining libor contracts will require client outreach and remediation. through mid-2022, the company's primary focus was supporting new loan production using sofr and other alternative reference rates as well as transitioning any renewing libor based contracts to alternative reference rates. efforts have shifted to amend and remediate contracts, excluding mortgage and student loans, that mature post june 30, 2023 ($127 billion), which will continue to be the focus during 2023. of the contracts remaining on libor that have not yet been remediated or modified to a new reference rate, truist's intends to add / update fallback language or move these contracts to new references rates prior to cessation. a significant portion of these contracts contain existing fallback language that will transition the contract to a prime based rate if not remediated, while a smaller population contains no historical fallback language. should the institution be unable to remediate all contracts, those based on prime will be prioritized to provide a more consistent client experience with the "hardwired fallback" transition to sofr. if there are remaining contracts without fallback language, truist may leverage recent legislation and corresponding safe harbor provision to transition these loans to sofr.
truist's adjustable-rate mortgage products ($3.5 billion) have consistent and adequate fallback language to transition away from libor in line with industry expectations; therefore, these contracts will not require remediation. remediation of student loans ($4.7 billion) will follow pending guidance from the department of education on the replacement rate for payment allowances on certain student loans and recent guidance from the cfpb to allow transition to "comparable rates," in the private student loan portfolio, where libor is used directly.
upon the discontinuation of libor, derivatives that reference libor will transition to a sofr-based replacement rate as set forth in the isda protocol addressing libor fallbacks or as established under the recently passed adjustable interest rate (libor) act and rules promulgated thereunder by the frb. certain derivatives without a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate will use the recent federal legislation to replace libor with a sofr-based rate established by frb rulemaking and follow the isda protocol for transition. this legislation will also provide additional administrative benefit for a small portion of the commercial and consumer lending portfolios where contracts do not contain fallback language and have not yet been remediated, providing a remediation path to a sofr based rate.
in addition, the transition from libor to an alternative reference rate, such as sofr, for the company's preferred stock and the company's and truist bank's floating rate notes is dependent on a number of factors, including the fallback language for the applicable series of preferred stock or notes, the application of the libor act and the rules promulgated thereunder by the frb, determinations to be made by third-party calculation or paying agents rather than the company or truist bank as to the replacement rates, and the impact of any publication of a synthetic u.s. dollar libor as currently proposed by the financial conduct authority. see "note 12. shareholders' equity" for information about preferred stock using libor.
training has been provided for impacted teammates and will continue during 2023. truist will continue to provide timely notices and information to impacted clients about the transition during the first half of 2023. truist continues to manage the impact of these contracts and other financial instruments, systems implications, hedging strategies, and related operational and market risks on established project plans for business and operational readiness to support the transition.
as of december 31, 2021, truist ceased entering into new contracts with a libor reference rate for all product offerings, except on a limited basis, as permissible. the company is actively using sofr as a reference rate and has originated approximately $119 billion of loans, issued $9.9 billion of long-term debt, and has $108 billion in notional derivative exposure using this alternative reference rate as of december 31, 2022. alternatives, such as sofr, may react differently from libor in times of economic stress. truist expects sofr to be the primary pricing benchmark used across the industry and will continue to offer additional sofr based products. market risks associated with the transition to alternative reference rates are dependent on market conditions as loans are transitioned to alternative reference rates during 2022 and early 2023. additional alternative reference rates, such as bloomberg short term bank yield, will be supported based on market demand. other emerging credit sensitive rates will be evaluated as additional alternatives for libor based on market developments. for a further discussion of the various risks associated with the potential cessation of libor and the transition to alternative reference rates, refer to the section titled "item1a. risk factors."
market risk from trading activities as a financial intermediary, truist provides its clients access to derivatives, foreign exchange and securities markets, which generate market risks. trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach, which includes measuring risk using var, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both the trading desk level and at the aggregate portfolio level, which is intended to ensure that exposures are in line with truist's risk appetite.
truist is also subject to risk-based capital guidelines for market risk under the market risk rule.
66 truist financial corporation covered trading positions covered positions subject to the market risk rule include trading assets and liabilities, specifically those held for the purpose of short-term resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected short-term price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits. truist's trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for the company's clients, as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity. the trading portfolio, measured in terms of var, consists primarily of four sub-portfolios of covered positions: (i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income securities, (iii) interest rate derivatives, and (iv) equity derivatives. as a market maker across different asset classes, truist's trading portfolio also contains other sub-portfolios, including foreign exchange, loan trading, and commodity derivatives; however, these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures.
valuation policies and methodologies exist for all trading positions. additionally, these positions are subject to independent price verification. see "note 19. derivative financial instruments," "note 18. fair value disclosures," and "critical accounting policies" herein for discussion of valuation policies and methodologies.
securitizations as of december 31, 2022, the aggregate market value of on-balance sheet securitization positions subject to the market risk rule was $12 million, all of which were non-agency asset backed securities positions. consistent with the market risk rule requirements, the company performs pre-purchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including, but not limited to, deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets, that materially affect valuation and performance. securitization positions are subject to truist's comprehensive risk management framework, which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits. there were no off-balance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period.
correlation trading positions the trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of december 31, 2022.
var-based measures var measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon. truist utilizes a historical var methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions. for risk management purposes, the var calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a one-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level. for market risk rule purposes, the company calculates var using a 10-day holding period and a 99% confidence level. due to inherent limitations of the var methodology, such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance, var is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk. other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing, scenario analysis, and stop loss limits.
the trading portfolio's var profile is influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and composition of the portfolio, market volatility, and the correlation between different positions. a portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual sub-portfolios, because, under normal market conditions, risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories. the following table summarizes certain var-based measures for the 12 months ended december 31, 2022 and 2021. average one and ten-day var measures for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased from the same period of last year, primarily driven by higher market volatility in 2022. maximum one and ten-day var measures for the year ended december 31, 2022 were lower than 2021 as heightened market volatility experienced during march 2020 was used for measuring var until march 2021.
credit spread risk                                                                                                                                               8                                                                          5
equity price risk                                                                                                                                                1                                                                          1
stressed var-based measures stressed var, another component of market risk capital, is calculated using the same internal models as used for the var-based measure. stressed var is calculated over a ten-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level and employs a historical simulation approach based on a continuous twelve-month historical window selected to reflect a period of significant financial stress for the company's trading portfolio. the following table summarizes stressed var-based measures:
specific risk measures specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements (e.g., default or event risks). the market risk rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a model-based approach, subject to regulatory approval. truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital. as such, incremental risk capital requirements do not apply.
var model backtesting in accordance with the market risk rule, the company evaluates the accuracy of its var model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) from covered positions with the corresponding daily var-based measures generated by the model. as illustrated in the following graph, there were no company-wide var backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended december 31, 2022. the total number of company-wide var backtesting exceptions over the preceding twelve months is used to determine the multiplication factor for the var-based capital requirement under the market risk rule. the capital multiplication factor increases from a minimum of three to a maximum of four, depending on the number of exceptions. all company-wide var backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of var model use and performance. there was no change in the capital multiplication factor over the preceding twelve months.
68 truist financial corporation model risk oversight mro is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision tools and models including trading market risk models. the validation activities are conducted in accordance with mro policy, which incorporates regulatory guidance related to the evaluation of model conceptual soundness, ongoing monitoring, and outcomes analysis. as part of ongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of all trading risk models are reviewed regularly to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets, assess evolving modeling approaches, and identify potential model enhancement.
stress testing the company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily var and other risk limits reporting. the stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme, but plausible, stress scenarios that could lead to large, unexpected losses. stress tests include simulations for historical repeats and hypothetical risk factor shocks. all trading positions within each applicable market risk category (interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange rate risk, credit spread risk, and commodity price risk) are included in the company's comprehensive stress testing framework. management reviews stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and makes updates, as necessary, which is intended to ensure that both current and emerging risks are captured appropriately. management also utilizes stress analyses to support the company's capital adequacy assessment standards. see the "capital" section of md&a for additional discussion of capital adequacy.
credit risk credit risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from the default, inability or unwillingness of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty to meet the terms of any financial obligation to truist or otherwise perform as agreed. credit risk exists in all activities where success depends on the performance of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty. credit risk arises when truist funds are extended, committed, invested, or otherwise exposed through actual or implied contractual agreements, whether on or off-balance sheet. credit risk increases when the credit quality of an issuer whose securities or other instruments the bank holds has deteriorated.
truist has established the following general practices to manage credit risk:
•limiting the amount of credit that individual lenders may extend to a borrower;
•establishing a process for credit approval accountability;
•careful initial underwriting and analysis of borrower, transaction, market and collateral risks;
•ongoing servicing and monitoring of individual loans and lending relationships;
•continuous monitoring of the portfolio, market dynamics and the economy; and
•periodically reevaluating the company's strategy and overall exposure as economic, market and other relevant conditions change.
the following discussion describes the underwriting procedures and overall risk management of truist's lending function.
underwriting approach the loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk; therefore, proper loan underwriting is critical to truist's long-term financial success. truist's underwriting approach is designed to define acceptable combinations of specific risk-mitigating features that promote credit relationships that conform to truist's risk philosophy. provided below is a summary of the most significant underwriting criteria used to evaluate new loans and loan renewals:
•cash flow and debt service coverage - cash flow adequacy is a necessary condition of creditworthiness, meaning that loans must either be clearly supported by a borrower's cash flow or, if not, must be justified by secondary repayment sources.
•secondary sources of repayment - alternative repayment funds are a significant risk-mitigating factor as long as they are liquid, can be easily accessed, and provide adequate resources to supplement the primary cash flow source.
•value of any underlying collateral - loans are generally secured by the asset being financed. because an analysis of the primary and secondary sources of repayment is the most important factor, collateral, unless it is liquid, does not justify loans that cannot be serviced by the borrower's normal cash flows.
•overall creditworthiness of the client, taking into account the client's relationships, both past and current, with truist and other lenders - truist's success depends on building lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with clients, which involves assessing their financial position and background.
•level of equity invested in the transaction - in general, borrowers are required to contribute or invest a portion of their own funds prior to any loan advances.
refer to the "lending activities" section in md&a for a discussion of each loan and lease portfolio.
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that (i) truist will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to obtain adequate funding (funding liquidity risk), or (ii) truist cannot easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions (market liquidity risk). refer to the "liquidity" section in md&a for additional discussion.
technology risk technology risk is the business risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence, and adoption of information technology across the company. truist has defined and adopted a technology risk framework that provides the foundation for technology risk strategy, program, and oversight and defines key objectives, operating model components, risk domains, and capabilities to manage this risk.
cybersecurity risk the technology landscape is constantly evolving, and new and unforeseen threats and actions by others may disrupt operations or result in losses beyond truist's risk control thresholds. truist maintains a comprehensive risk-based information security / cybersecurity framework implemented through people, processes, and technology whereby truist actively monitors and evaluates threats, events, and the performance of its business operations and continually adapts its risk mitigation activities accordingly.
truist's framework aligns with those of the national institute of standards and technology, cyber risk institute, the international standards organization 27000 series, the it governance institute, and the control objectives for information and related technology, as well as conforms with the requirements and guidance from applicable regulatory authorities, including the federal financial institutions examination council. in addition, truist's framework, which includes internally and externally focused capabilities, drives the development and implementation of truist's data security strategy that is designed to reduce risk while enabling truist's corporate business objectives.
truist has built an organization with dedicated, skilled talent to operationalize truist's cybersecurity strategy. the cybersecurity strategy is enabled by continuous enhancement of truist's multilayered defenses including advanced capabilities for early and rapid cyber threat identification, detection, protection, response, and recovery. truist participates in the federally recognized financial services information sharing and analysis center as a key part of the company's cyber threat intelligence and response programs, as well as other industry organizations and initiatives that promote industry best practices such as harmonized cybersecurity standards, cyber readiness, and secure consumer financial data sharing.
70 truist financial corporation to further mitigate the risks presented by an evolving cyber threat landscape, truist provides data protection guidance to clients and promotes data protection awareness and accountability through mandatory teammate training. truist conducts scenario-driven test exercises simulating impacts and consequences developed through analysis of real-world technology incidents as well as known and anticipated cyber threats. these exercises are designed to assess the viability of truist's crisis response and management programs and provide the basis for continuous improvement.
truist's cybersecurity risk program is overseen by executive leadership and the board. regular updates on the status of the cybersecurity risk program, including information security risks and incidents, emerging threats, and control environment, are aggregated and escalated to executive leadership and the board. additionally, truist has a cyber incident response team that manages significant cyber-specific events with escalation up to executive leadership and the board. truist's framework requires annual exercises at a minimum to test truist's preparedness. the board devotes significant time and attention to its oversight of cyber security risk and approves related information security policies. although truist has invested substantial resources to manage and reduce cybersecurity risk, it is not possible to completely eliminate this risk. truist obtains insurance that protects against certain losses, expenses, and damages associated with cybersecurity risk. see item 1a, "risk factors," for additional information regarding cybersecurity risk.
compliance risk compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies, and procedures or ethical standards. this risk exposes truist to fines, civil monetary penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. compliance risk can result in diminished reputation, reduced franchise or enterprise value, limited business opportunities, and lessened expansion potential.
strategic risk strategic risk is the risk of financial loss, diminished stakeholder confidence, or negative impact to human capital resulting from ineffective strategy setting and execution, adverse business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment. truist is committed to fulfilling its overall strategic objectives by selecting business strategies and operating businesses in a manner consistent with its established risk appetite, achieving profitability/earnings growth and maintaining strong confidence and trust with its key stakeholder constituencies.
reputational risk reputational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, enterprise value, the truist brand, and public confidence arising from negative publicity or public opinion, whether real or perceived, regarding truist's business practices, products, services, transactions, or other activities undertaken by truist, its representatives, or its partners. a negative reputation may impair truist's relationship with clients, teammates, communities, or shareholders, and it is often a residual risk that arises when other risks are not managed properly.
operational risk operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events. it includes legal risk, which is the risk of loss arising from defective transactions, litigation or claims made, or the failure to adequately protect company-owned assets. an operational loss occurs when an event results in a loss or reserve originating from operational risk.
model risk model risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. truist uses models for many purposes, including the valuation of financial positions, estimation of credit losses, and the measurement of risk. valuation models are used to value certain financial instruments for which quoted prices may not be readily available. valuation models are also used as inputs for var, the estimation of var itself, regulatory capital, stress testing, and the acl. models are owned by the applicable bus, who are responsible for the development, implementation, and use of their models. oversight of these functions is performed by the mro, which is a component of the rmo. once models have been approved, model owners are responsible for the maintenance of an appropriate operating environment and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on a recurring basis. models are updated in response to changes in portfolio composition, industry and economic conditions, technological capabilities, and other developments.
mro manages model risk in a holistic manner through a suite of model governance and model validation activities. the risk of each model is assessed and classified into various risk tiers. additionally, mro maintains an enterprise-wide model inventory containing relevant model information. regarding model validation, mro utilizes internal validation analysts and managers with skill sets in predictive modeling to perform detailed reviews of model development, implementation, and conceptual soundness. on certain occasions, the mro will also engage external parties to assist with validation efforts. once in a production environment, mro assesses a model's performance on a periodic basis through ongoing monitoring reviews. mro tracks issues that have been identified during model validation or through ongoing monitoring and engages with model owners to ensure their timely remediation. mro gauges model risk utilizing a collection of key risk indicators, which are periodically reported to relevant committees, including but not limited to, the model risk oversight committee as well as the board risk committee. mro will also present model risk topics to the board risk committee as necessary.
liquidity liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs, including deposit withdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other liabilities, and funding of loan commitments. in addition to the level of liquid assets, such as cash, cash equivalents, and afs securities, other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs, including access to a variety of funding sources, maintaining borrowing capacity, growing core deposits, loan repayment, and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale.
truist monitors the ability to meet client demand for funds under both normal and stressed market conditions. in considering its liquidity position, management evaluates truist's funding mix based on client core funding, client rate-sensitive funding, and national markets funding. in addition, management evaluates exposure to rate-sensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less. management also measures liquidity needs against 30 days of stressed cash outflows for truist and truist bank. to ensure a strong liquidity position and compliance with regulatory requirements, management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities.
internal liquidity stress testing liquidity stress testing is designed to ensure that truist and truist bank have sufficient liquidity for a variety of institution-specific and market-wide adverse scenarios. each liquidity stress test scenario applies defined assumptions to execute sources and uses of liquidity over varying planning horizons. the types of expected liquidity uses during a stressed event may include deposit attrition, contractual maturities, reductions in unsecured and secured funding, and increased draws on unfunded commitments. to mitigate liquidity outflows, truist has identified sources of liquidity; however, access to these sources of liquidity could be affected within a stressed environment.
truist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cash-flow needs and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. the liquidity buffer consists of unencumbered highly liquid assets and truist's liquidity buffer is substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as hqla under the lcr rule.
contingency funding plan truist has a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments, particularly in the event of a liquidity contraction. this plan is designed to examine and quantify the organization's liquidity under the various internal liquidity stress scenarios and is periodically tested to assess the plan's reliability. additionally, the plan provides a framework for management and other teammates to follow in the event of a liquidity contraction or in anticipation of such an event. the plan addresses authority for activation and decision making, liquidity options, and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of a liquidity contraction.
lcr and hqla the lcr rule requires that truist and truist bank maintain an amount of eligible hqla that is sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of stress. eligible hqla, for purposes of calculating the lcr, is the amount of unencumbered hqla that satisfy operational requirements of the lcr rule. truist and truist bank are subject to the category iii reduced lcr requirements. truist held average weighted eligible hqla of $89.4 billion and truist's average lcr was 112% for the three months ended december 31, 2022.
effective july 2021, truist became subject to final rules implementing the nsfr, which are designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain a stable, long-term funding profile in relation to their asset composition and off-balance sheet activities. at december 31, 2022, the company was compliant with this requirement.
72 truist financial corporation sources of funds management believes current sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet truist's on- and off-balance sheet obligations. truist funds its balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including client deposits, secured and unsecured capital markets funding, and shareholders' equity. truist bank's primary source of funding is client deposits. continued access to client deposits is highly dependent on public confidence in the stability of truist bank and its ability to return funds to clients when requested.
truist bank maintains a number of diverse funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements. these sources include unsecured borrowings from the capital markets through the issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes, institutional cds, overnight and term federal funds markets, and retail brokered cds. truist bank also maintains access to secured borrowing sources including fhlb advances, repurchase agreements, and the frb discount window. available investment securities could be pledged to create additional secured borrowing capacity. the following table presents a summary of truist bank's available secured borrowing capacity and eligible cash at the frb:

at december 31, 2022, truist bank's available secured borrowing capacity represented approximately 4.7 times the amount of wholesale funding maturities in one-year or less. fhlb unused borrowing capacity was $20.8 billion at december 31, 2022, down from $49.2 billion at december 31, 2021 primarily due to increases in short-term borrowings.
parent company the parent company serves as the primary source of capital for the operating subsidiaries. the parent company's assets consist primarily of cash on deposit with truist bank, equity investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and notes receivable from subsidiaries. the principal obligations of the parent company are payments on long-term debt. the main sources of funds for the parent company are dividends and management fees from subsidiaries, repayments of advances to subsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance of equity and long-term debt. the primary uses of funds by the parent company are investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders, repurchases of common stock, and payments on long-term debt. see "note 22. parent company financial information" for additional information regarding dividends from subsidiaries and debt transactions.
access to funding at the parent company is more sensitive to market disruptions. therefore, truist prudently manages cash levels at the parent company to cover a minimum of one year of projected cash outflows which includes unfunded external commitments, debt service, common and preferred dividends and scheduled debt maturities, without the benefit of any new cash inflows. truist maintains a significant buffer above the projected one year of cash outflows. in determining the buffer, truist considers cash requirements for common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates, serving as a source of strength to truist bank, and being able to withstand sustained market disruptions that could limit access to the capital markets. at december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, the parent company had 37 months and 35 months, respectively, of cash on hand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and 22 months and 19 months, respectively, when including the payment of common stock dividends.
credit ratings credit ratings are forward-looking opinions of rating agencies as to the company's ability to meet its financial commitments and repay its securities and obligations in accordance with their terms of issuance. credit ratings influence both borrowing costs and access to the capital markets. the company's credit ratings are continuously monitored by the rating agencies and are subject to change at any time. as truist seeks to maintain high-quality credit ratings, management meets with the major rating agencies on a regular basis to provide financial and business updates and to discuss current outlooks and trends. see item 1a, "risk factors" for additional information regarding factors that influence credit ratings and potential risks that could materialize in the event of downgrade in the company's credit ratings.

•on january 19, 2022, s&p global ratings published truist's assigned esg credit indicators of e-2, s-2, and g-2, which were consistent with the scores assigned to most other banks and which indicated that environmental, social and governance factors have "no material influence" on the rating agency's analysis of the company.
•on august 15, 2022, dbrs morningstar upgraded the ratings of truist, including the long-term issuer rating to "aa (low)" from "a (high)." dbrs morningstar also upgraded the ratings of truist bank, including the long-term issuer rating to "aa" from "aa (low)." the trend for all ratings was revised to "stable" from "positive." the rating actions reflected the scale, quality, and diversity of truist's franchise; the completion of the merger integration; truist's diversified products and geography; and the company's sound balance sheet fundamentals and conservative risk profile.
•on october 21, 2022, fitch ratings affirmed the ratings of truist and truist bank, including the long-term and short-term issuer default ratings at "a+" and "f1," respectively, for both entities. fitch ratings also maintained a "stable" ratings outlook for all ratings. in affirming the ratings, fitch cited truist's diverse business model, conservative credit culture, and the completion of the merger integration.
•on november 3, 2022, moody's investors service affirmed all of the ratings of truist and its subsidiaries, including truist bank. moody's also maintained a "stable" rating outlook for truist. moody's stated that the affirmation of truist's ratings reflects the effective completion of its multi-year integration and truist's strong, diverse, and resilient platform for organic growth, among, among other factors.
management believes current sources of liquidity are adequate to meet truist's current requirements and plans for continued growth. as of december 31, 2022, the company had $2.1 billion in obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding. many of the purchase obligations have terms that are not fixed and determinable and are included in the total amount of obligations based upon the estimated timing and amount of payment. in addition, certain of the purchase agreements contain clauses that would allow truist to cancel the agreement with specified notice; however, that impact is not included in determining the total amount of obligations. see "note 9. other assets and liabilities," "note 11. borrowings," and "note 16. commitments and contingencies" for additional information regarding outstanding balances of sources of liquidity and contractual commitments and obligations.
capital the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis. truist's principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support truist's risk profile consistent with the board-approved risk appetite, provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve optimal credit ratings for truist and its subsidiaries, remain a source of strength for its subsidiaries, and provide a competitive return to shareholders. risk-based capital ratios, which include cet1 capital, tier 1 capital, and total capital are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets.
74 truist financial corporation truist regularly performs stress testing on its capital levels and is required to periodically submit the company's capital plans and stress testing results to the banking regulators. management regularly monitors the capital position of truist on both a consolidated and bank-level basis. in this regard, management's objective is to maintain capital at levels that are in excess of internal capital limits, which are above the regulatory "well capitalized" minimums. management has implemented internal stress capital ratio minimums to evaluate whether capital ratios calculated after the effect of alternative capital actions are likely to remain above internal minimums. breaches of internal stressed minimums prompt a review of the planned capital actions included in truist's capital plan.

payments of cash dividends and repurchases of common shares are the methods used to manage any excess capital generated. in addition, management closely monitors the parent company's double leverage ratio (investments in subsidiaries as a percentage of shareholders' equity). the active management of the subsidiaries' equity capital is the process used to manage this important driver of parent company liquidity and is a key element in the management of truist's capital position.
management intends to maintain capital at truist bank at levels that exceed the minimum capital plus ccb. this will also result in truist bank being "well-capitalized" for regulatory purposes. secondarily, it is management's intent to maintain truist bank's capital at levels that result in regulatory risk-based capital ratios that are generally comparable with peers of similar size, complexity, and risk profile. if the capital levels of truist bank increase above these guidelines, excess capital may be transferred to the parent company in the form of special dividend payments, subject to regulatory and other operating considerations.
management's capital deployment plan in order of preference is to focus on (i) organic growth, (ii) dividends, (iii) strategic opportunities and acquisitions, and (iv) share repurchases if excess capital is available.

(1)tangible common equity and related measures are non-gaap measures that exclude the impact of intangible assets, net of deferred taxes, and their related amortization. these measures are useful for evaluating the performance of a business consistently, whether acquired or developed internally. truist's management uses these measures to assess profitability, returns relative to balance sheet risk, and shareholder value. these capital measures are not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures that may be presented by other companies.
truist's capital level at december 31, 2022 remains strong compared to the regulatory levels for well capitalized banks. truist's cet1 ratio was 9.0% as of december 31, 2022. the decline compared to the 2021 cet1 ratio primarily reflects strong loan growth, acquisitions, and the impact from the phase-in of the cecl transition relief.
truist increased the quarterly common dividend 8% during the year, paid $2.7 billion in common stock dividends or $2.00 per share, and repurchased $250 million of common stock. the dividend payout ratio for 2022 was 45% compared to 41% for the prior year. the total payout ratio for 2022 was 49% compared to 68% for the prior year, reflecting a greater focus on deploying capital to fund organic growth and acquisitions in 2022. in early 2023, truist declared common dividends of $0.52 per share for the first quarter of 2023.
reclassifications in certain circumstances, reclassifications have been made to prior period information to conform to the current presentation. such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported shareholders' equity or net income. refer to "note 1. basis of presentation" for additional discussion regarding reclassifications.
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of truist are in accordance with gaap and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. the financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the consolidated financial position and/or consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. understanding truist's accounting policies is fundamental to understanding the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. accordingly, truist's significant accounting policies and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in detail in "note 1. basis of presentation."
the following is a summary of truist's critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions, and judgments. these critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a periodic basis.
76 truist financial corporation acl truist's acl represents management's best estimate of expected future credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date. estimates of expected future loan and lease losses are determined by using statistical models and management's judgement. the models are designed to forecast probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default by correlating certain macroeconomic forecast data to historical experience. the models are generally applied at the portfolio level to pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. the macroeconomic data used in the models is based on forecasted variables for the reasonable and supportable period of two years. beyond this forecast period the models gradually revert to long-term historical loss conditions over a one-year period. as a means of addressing uncertainty related to future economic conditions, the quantitative allowance includes an adjustment that reflects model output calculated using a range of potential future economic conditions. expected losses are estimated through contractual maturity, giving appropriate consideration to expected prepayments unless the borrower has a right to renew that is not cancellable or it is reasonably expected that the loan will be modified as a tdr.
a qualitative allowance which incorporates management's judgement is also included in the estimation of expected future loan and lease losses, including qualitative adjustments in circumstances where the model output is inconsistent with management's expectations with respect to expected credit losses. this allowance is used to adjust for limitations in modeled results related to the current economic conditions, and considerations with respect to the impact of current and expected events or risks, the outcomes of which are uncertain and may not be completely considered by quantitative models.
management considers a range of macroeconomic forecast data in connection with the allowance estimation process. under the range of scenarios considered as of december 31, 2022, use of the company's pessimistic scenario would have resulted in an increase to the modeled allowance results of approximately $2.2 billion. this estimate reflects the sensitivity of the modeled allowance estimate to macroeconomic forecast data but does not consider other qualitative adjustments that could increase or decrease modeled loss estimates calculated using this alternative economic scenario.
the company individually evaluates expected credits losses related to loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics and loans that have been classified as a tdr. for individually evaluated loans, the alll is determined through review of data specific to the borrower and related collateral, if any, while for tdrs, default expectations and estimated prepayment speeds that are specific to each of the restructured loan populations are incorporated in the determination of the alll.
the methodology used to determine an estimate for the rufc is similar to that used to determine the funded component of the alll and is measured over the period there is a contractual obligation to extend credit that is not unconditionally cancellable. the rufc is adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at default. a detailed discussion of the methodology used in determining the acl is included in "note 1. basis of presentation."
fair value of financial instruments the vast majority of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are based on either quoted market prices or market prices for similar instruments. refer to "note 18. fair value disclosures" for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments and "note 2. business combinations" for additional disclosures regarding business combinations.
securities truist generally utilizes a third-party pricing service in determining the fair value of its afs investment securities, whereas trading securities are priced internally. fair value measurements for investment securities are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads, and broker quotes. management performs procedures to evaluate the fair values provided by the third-party service provider. these procedures, which are performed independent of the responsible business unit, include comparison of pricing information received from the third-party pricing service to other third-party pricing sources, review of additional information provided by the third-party pricing service and other third-party sources for selected securities and back-testing to compare the price realized on security sales to the daily pricing information received from the third-party pricing service. the enterprise valuation committee, which provides oversight to truist's enterprise-wide ipv function, is responsible for the comparison of pricing information received from the third-party pricing service or internally to other third-party pricing sources, approving tolerance limits determined by ipv for price comparison exceptions, reviewing significant changes to pricing and valuation policies and reviewing and approving the pricing decisions made on any illiquid and hard-to-price securities. when market observable data is not available, which generally occurs due to the lack of liquidity or inactive markets for certain securities, the valuation of the security is subjective and may involve substantial judgment by management to reflect unobservable input assumptions.
msrs truist's primary class of msrs for which it separately manages the economic risks relates to residential mortgages. residential msrs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. while sales of msrs do occur, the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available. accordingly, truist estimates the fair value of residential msrs using a stochastic oas valuation model to project residential msr cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios, which are then discounted at risk-adjusted rates. the oas model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenue, costs to service and other economic factors. truist reassesses and periodically adjusts the underlying inputs and assumptions in the oas model to reflect market conditions and assumptions that a market participant would consider in valuing the residential msr asset.
fair value estimates and assumptions are compared to industry surveys, recent market activity, actual portfolio experience and, when available, observable market data. due to the nature of the valuation inputs, residential msrs are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. the value of residential msrs is significantly affected by mortgage interest rates available in the marketplace, which influence mortgage loan prepayment speeds. in general, during periods of declining interest rates, the value of msrs declines due to increasing prepayments attributable to increased mortgage-refinance activity. conversely, during periods of rising interest rates, the value of residential msrs generally increases due to reduced refinance activity. truist typically hedges against market value changes in the residential msrs. refer to "note 8. loan servicing" for quantitative disclosures reflecting the effect that changes in management's assumptions would have on the fair value of residential msrs.
lhfs truist originates certain residential and commercial mortgage loans for sale to investors that are measured at fair value. the fair value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans. changes in the fair value are recorded as components of mortgage banking income, while the related origination costs are generally recognized in personnel expense when incurred. the changes in fair value are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the lhfs. truist uses various derivative instruments to mitigate the economic effect of changes in fair value of the underlying loans. lhfs also includes certain loans, generally carried at locom, where management has committed to a formal plan of sale and the loans are available for immediate sale. adjustments to reflect unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value, up to the original carrying amount, and realized gains and losses upon ultimate sale are classified as noninterest income. the fair value of these loans is estimated using observable market prices when available. when observable market prices are not available, the company uses judgment and estimates fair value using internal models that reflect assumptions consistent with those that would be used by a market participant in estimating fair value. refer to "note 1. basis of presentation" for further description of the company's accounting for lhfs.
trading loans truist elects to measure certain loans at fair value for financial reporting where fair value aligns with the underlying business purpose. specifically, loans included within this classification include trading loans that are (i) purchased in connection with the company's trs business, (ii) part of the loan sales and trading business within the c&cb segment, or (iii) backed by the sba. refer to "note 16. commitments and contingencies," and "note 19. derivative financial instruments," for further discussion of the company's trs business. the loans purchased in connection with the company's trs and sales and trading businesses are primarily commercial and corporate leveraged loans valued based on quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active by a third-party pricing service. sba loans are fully guaranteed by the u.s. government as to contractual principal and interest and there is sufficient observable trading activity upon which to base the estimate of fair value.
derivative assets and liabilities truist uses derivatives to manage various financial risks and in a dealer capacity to facilitate client transactions. truist mitigates credit risk by subjecting counterparties to credit reviews and approvals similar to those used in making loans and other extensions of credit. in addition, certain counterparties are required to provide collateral to truist when their unsecured loss positions exceed certain negotiated limits. the fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices and internal pricing models that use market observable data for interest rates, foreign exchange, equity, and credit. the fair value of interest rate lock commitments, which are related to mortgage loan commitments, is based on quoted market prices adjusted for commitments that truist does not expect to fund and includes the value attributable to the net servicing fee. refer to "note 19. derivative financial instruments" for further information on the company's derivatives.
78 truist financial corporation goodwill and other intangible assets the acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded at their fair values. this often involves estimates based on third-party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, which are inherently subjective. the amortization of definite-lived intangible assets is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received, which is also subjective. business combinations also typically result in goodwill, which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair values of the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates. refer to "note 1. basis of presentation" for a description of the impairment testing process.
at december 31, 2022, truist's reporting units with goodwill balances were cb&w, c&cb, and ih. management reviews the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as of october 1 or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. for its annual impairment review, truist elected to perform a qualitative test of each of its reporting units.
in performing the qualitative assessment as of october 1, 2022, the company evaluated events and circumstances since the last quantitative goodwill assessment, macroeconomic conditions, truist's own operations, key financial metrics, as well as reporting unit and company financial performance, and the industry in which it operates. after assessing all relevant events or circumstances, truist concluded that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value.
the company also performs sensitivity analyses around the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative test as well as relevant events or circumstances in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions, and the resulting estimated fair values. while the company's sensitivity analyses did not indicate risk of impairment as of october 1, 2022, future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. additionally, a reporting unit's carrying value could change based on market conditions, asset growth, or the risk profile of those reporting units, which could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value.
the company monitored events and circumstances during the fourth quarter of 2022, concluding that it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of december 31, 2022.
income taxes truist is subject to income tax laws of the u.s., its states, and the municipalities in which the company conducts business. in estimating the net amount due to or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future, the company assesses the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other pertinent information. the income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining the tax accruals and in evaluating the company's tax positions, including evaluating uncertain tax positions. changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws and new judicial guidance, the status of examinations by the tax authorities, and newly enacted statutory and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits and risks of tax positions. these changes, when they occur, impact tax expense and can materially affect operating results. truist reviews tax positions quarterly and adjusts accrued taxes as new information becomes available.
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. such assets arise due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from nol and tax credit carryforwards. the company regularly evaluates the ability to realize dtas, recognizing a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the dta will not be realized. in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, the company considers the level of taxable income in prior years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws, as well as estimates of future pre-tax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented. truist currently maintains a valuation allowance for certain state carryforwards. for additional income tax information, refer to "note 1. basis of presentation" and "note 14. income taxes."
pension and postretirement benefit obligations truist offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to teammates. calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions, which are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used. the discount rate assumption used to measure the postretirement benefit obligations is set by reference to an aa above median corporate bond yield curve and the individual characteristics of the plans such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations.
management also considered the sensitivity that changes in the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate would have on pension expense. for the company's qualified plans, a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would result in additional pension expense of approximately $46 million for 2023, while a decrease of 100 basis points in the expected return on plan assets would result in an increase of approximately $136 million in pension expense for 2023. this estimate reflects the sensitivity of certain factors considered in calculation of pension expense but does not consider all factors that could increase or decrease estimates calculated.
the calculation of pension assets and liabilities is also impacted by the year-end valuation, which takes into account the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the estimated return on plan assets that was recognized during the year, as well as an updated discount rate based on current market rates. the year-end valuation resulted in a pre-tax loss in other comprehensive income of $1.9 billion for all pension plans. as expected return on plan assets is determined with the prior year-end's plan asset valuation, the lower year-end plan asset valuation and related amortization of accumulated other comprehensive income will reduce the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension cost recognized in other expense in 2023.
refer to "note 15. benefit plans" for disclosures related to the benefit plans.

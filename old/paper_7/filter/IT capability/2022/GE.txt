2022 form 10-k our products, services and activities are subject to a number of global regulators such as the u.s. federal aviation administration (faa), european union aviation safety agency (easa), civil aviation administration of china (caac) and other regulatory bodies.
significant trends & developments. our results in 2022 reflect the continued recovery of commercial air travel from the effects of the covid-19 pandemic. a key underlying driver of our commercial engine and services business is global commercial air traffic, which improved 21% during 2022 compared to 2021, and now stands at approximately 90% of 2019 levels.
the recovery trends vary by region from the travel restrictions imposed by governments and the prevalence of covid-19 virus variants around the globe. we remain confident in the recovery, and current trends are in line with our recovery forecast. consistent with updated industry projections, we estimate both narrowbody and widebody air traffic to recover to 2019 levels in late 2023. we are in frequent dialogue with our airline, airframe, and maintenance, repair and overhaul customers about the outlook for commercial air travel, new aircraft production, fleet retirements, and after-market services, including shop visit and spare parts demand.
as it relates to the military environment, we continue to forecast strong military demand creating future growth opportunities for our military business as the u.s. department of defense and foreign governments have continued flight operations, and have allocated budgets to upgrade and modernize their existing fleets. in september 2022, aerospace and the u.s. air force successfully concluded testing on the second xa100 adaptive cycle engine, marking the final major contract milestone of the air force's adaptive engine transition program (aetp).
global material availability and labor shortages, in part driven by the pandemic, continue to cause disruptions for us and our suppliers, and have impacted our production and delivery across our businesses. we increased our commercial and military engine sales units by 13% in 2022 compared to 2021, and the combined engine sales units increased more than 25% in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2022. we continue to partner with our airframe partners on future production rates. aerospace has proactively managed the impact of inflationary pressure by deploying lean initiatives to drive cost productivity, partnering with our suppliers and adjusting the pricing of our products and services. we expect the impact of inflation will continue to be challenging and we will continue to take actions to manage.
total engineering, comprising company, customer and partner-funded and nonrecurring engineering costs, increased compared to the prior year. we continue to be committed to investment in developing and maturing technologies that enable a more sustainable future of flight.
we continue to take actions to protect our ability to serve our customers now and as the global airline industry recovers. our deep history of innovation and technology leadership, commercial engine installed base, including joint ventures, of approximately 40,900 units, with approximately 11,600 units under long-term service agreements, and military engine installed base of approximately 26,100 units represents strong long-term fundamentals. we believe aerospace is well-positioned to drive long-term profitable growth and cash generation over time.

2022 form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, segment revenues were up $4.7 billion (22%) and segment profit was up $1.9 billion (66%).
rpo as of december 31, 2022 increased $10.0 billion (8%) from december 31, 2021, due to increases in both equipment and services. equipment increased primarily due to an increase in commercial and military orders since december 31, 2021. services increased primarily as a result of engines contracted under long-term service agreements that have now been put into service and contract modifications.
revenues increased $4.8 billion (23%) organically*. commercial services revenues increased, primarily due to increased shop visit volume and commercial spare part shipments, and higher prices. commercial services revenues also increased due to a net favorable change of $0.1 billion for its long-term service agreements compared to a net unfavorable change of $0.3 billion in the prior year. commercial engines revenues increased, primarily driven by 176 more commercial install and spare engine unit shipments, including 291 more leap units versus the prior year, partially offset by lower genx engine production rates and product transition with fewer engine shipments on legacy programs. military revenues increased, primarily due to growth in services and 79 more engine shipments than the prior year, partially offset by product mix.
profit increased $1.8 billion (62%) organically*, primarily due to increased shop visit volume and commercial spare part shipments, higher prices and the impact of favorable contract margin reviews for long-term service agreements. these increases in profit were partially offset by lower profit on commercial engine shipments driven by product transition with fewer engine shipments on legacy programs and more shipments on newer programs, inflation in our supply chain and additional growth investment.
renewable energy - will be part of ge vernova, ge's portfolio of energy businesses. we benefit from one of the broadest portfolios in the industry that uniquely positions us to lead the energy transition while building on advanced technologies that grow renewable energy generation, lower the cost of electricity and modernize the grid. our portfolio of business units includes onshore and offshore wind, blade manufacturing, grid solutions, hydro, storage, hybrid renewables and digital services offerings. we have installed more than 400 gigawatts of clean renewable energy equipment and equipped more than 90% of transmission utilities with our grid solutions in developed and emerging markets.
onshore wind - delivers technology and services for the onshore wind power industry by providing a range of turbines. wind services assist customers in improving cost, capacity and performance of their assets over the lifetime of their fleet, utilizing digital infrastructure to monitor, predict and optimize wind farm energy performance. our onshore wind business supports a turbine installed base of approximately 54,000 units, of which, slightly less than half are under service agreements.
grid solutions equipment and services (grid) - enables power utilities and industries worldwide to effectively manage electricity from the point of generation to consumption, helping the reliability, efficiency and resiliency of the grid. service offerings include a comprehensive portfolio of equipment, hardware, protection and control, automation and digital services. grid is also addressing the challenges of the energy transition by safely and reliably connecting intermittent renewable energy generation to transmission networks.
hydro, offshore wind and hybrid solutions - hydro provides a portfolio of solutions and services for hydropower generation for both large hydropower plants and small hydropower solutions. offshore wind leads the industry in wind power technologies and wind farm development. hybrid solutions provides integration of renewable energies that drive stability to the grid and integrates storage and renewable energy generation sources.
competition & regulation. while many factors, including government incentives, specific market rules, and permitting regulations and challenges, affect how renewable energy can deliver outcomes for customers in a given region, renewable energy has become competitive with fossil fuels in terms of levelized cost of electricity. we continue to invest in improving the durability of our wind turbine products, fleet availability and project execution with increased focus on project selectivity. additionally, we continue to explore ways to further improve the efficiency and flexibility of our hydropower technology with new innovative turbine designs and digital solutions. as industry models continue to evolve, our digital strategy and investments in technical innovation will position us to add value for customers looking for clean, renewable energy.
significant trends & developments. during the third quarter of 2022, the inflation reduction act of 2022 (ira) was signed into law, introducing new and extending existing tax incentives for 10 years. the ira is expected to resolve recent u.s. policy uncertainty that resulted in project delays and deferral of customer investments in onshore wind and significantly increase near- and longer-term demand in the u.s. for onshore and offshore wind projects. the timing of this demand growth depends in part on how quickly the ira incentives are implemented. while the offshore wind industry continues to expect global growth through the decade, cost pressures and the ability to complete with the rapid pace of innovation remain key challenges. finally, our grid business is positioned to support grid expansion and modernization needs.
we have experienced significant cost inflation across all businesses which we expect to continue, and are working to mitigate through pricing and cost actions. at onshore wind, based on experience across our fleet, we are deploying repairs and other corrective measures to improve our overall quality and fleet availability resulting in higher warranty and related reserves. concurrently, we are undertaking a restructuring program to reduce fixed cost, reflecting our selectivity strategy to operate in fewer markets and to simplify and standardize product variants. our financial results are dependent on costs to address fleet availability and quality, execution of cost reduction initiatives and the inflationary environment. additionally, initiatives to improve selectivity and pricing as well as u.s. treasury tax implementation guidance related to the ira are expected to further improve our results.

for the year ended december 31, 2022, segment revenues were down $2.7 billion (17%) and segment losses were up $1.4 billion.
revenues decreased $2.1 billion (13%) organically*, primarily from 1,400 fewer wind turbine deliveries, primarily at onshore wind, including customer delays and deferrals due to u.s. tax policy uncertainty, and lower revenue at grid due to increased commercial selectivity, partially offset by higher services revenue at onshore wind from a larger installed base.
segment losses increased $1.5 billion organically*, primarily attributable to onshore wind's lower u.s. volume, higher warranty and related reserve charges of $0.5 billion in the third quarter of 2022 in response to the deployment of corrective measures and repair campaigns within our fleet, execution of lower margin rpo and the impact of transitioning to newer product offerings internationally. additionally, we observed cost inflation across all businesses and higher ramp up costs at offshore wind. these higher costs were partially offset by the favorable impact of cost reduction initiatives and lower project related charges, primarily at grid.
power - will be part of ge vernova, ge's portfolio of energy businesses. power serves power generation, industrial, government and other customers worldwide with products and services related to energy production. our products and technologies harness resources such as oil, gas, fossil, diesel and nuclear to produce electric power and include gas and steam turbines, full balance of plant, upgrade and service solutions, as well as data-leveraging software. we have organized the businesses within our power segment into gas power, steam power and power conversion, nuclear and other.

2022 form 10-k competition & regulation. worldwide competition for power generation products and services is intense. demand for power generation is global, and as a result, is sensitive to the economic and political environments of each country in which we do business. our products and services sold to end customers are often subject to many regulatory requirements and performance standards under different federal, state, foreign and energy industry standards. in addition, we are subject to market and other dynamics related to decarbonization, where it will remain important to lower greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come, which will likely depend in part on technologies that are not yet deployed or widely adopted today but may become more important over time (such as hydrogen-based power generation, carbon capture and sequestration technologies or small modular or other advanced nuclear power).
significant trends & developments. during the year ended december 31, 2022, global gas power generation grew mid-single digits and ge gas turbine utilization grew low-single digits with strength in the u.s. utilization of the fleet continues to follow growing gas power generation, capturing shortfalls from coal retirements, and resilient asset usage with a dynamic europe environment with the russia and ukraine conflict and mild winter. looking ahead, we anticipate h-class units to be commissioned into the serviceable installed base and the uncertain timing of deal closures due to financing and the complexities of working in emerging markets. power has proactively managed the impact of inflationary pressure by deploying lean initiatives to drive cost productivity, partnering with our suppliers and adjusting the pricing of our products and services. we expect the impact of inflation will continue to be challenging and we will continue to take actions to manage. although market factors related to the energy transition such as greater renewable energy penetration and the adoption of climate change-related policies continue to impact long-term demand (and related financing), we expect the gas market to remain stable over the next decade with gas generation continuing to grow low-single-digits. we believe gas will play a critical role in the energy transition. we remain focused on our underwriting discipline and risk management to ensure we are securing deals that meet our financial hurdles and we have high confidence to deliver for our customers.
in the first quarter of 2022, we signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding for ge steam power to sell a portion of its business to électricité de france s.a. (edf), which resulted in a reclassification of that business to held for sale. in the fourth quarter of 2022, we signed a binding agreement and expect to complete the sale, subject to regulatory approval, in the second half of 2023. in the second quarter of 2022, we announced that gas power intends to acquire nexus controls, a business specializing in aftermarket control system upgrades and controls field services. the deal, which is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approval and mandatory information and consultation processes with employees and their representatives, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023.
we continue to invest in new product development, such as our nuclear small modular reactors and our ha-turbines, with over 1.6 million operating hours. our fundamentals remain strong with approximately $69.0 billion in rpo, including 27 ha-turbines, and a gas turbine installed base of approximately 7,000 units, including 78 ha-turbines, which has nearly doubled since 2019, and approximately 1,800 units under long-term service agreements.

for the year ended december 31, 2022, segment revenues were down $0.6 billion (4%) and segment profit was up $0.5 billion (68%).
rpo as of december 31, 2022 increased $0.2 billion from december 31, 2021, primarily driven by gas power services and equipment, partially offset by the continued wind down of the steam power new build coal business.
2022 form 10-k revenues increased $0.4 billion (2%) organically*, primarily due to higher gas power aeroderivative deliveries, favorable price in gas power contractual and non-contractual services and growth in gas power non-contractual services, partially offset by lower planned contractual services outages in gas power and a reduction in steam power equipment on the exit of new build coal and prior year steam power services volume that did not repeat.
profit increased $0.5 billion (69%) organically* primarily due to prior year project and legal charges at steam power that did not repeat, reduced intangible asset amortization at steam power, favorable price in gas power contractual and non-contractual services and higher gas power aeroderivative deliveries, partially offset by lower gas power planned contractual services outages, unfavorable equipment mix at gas power, a reduction in steam power equipment on the exit of new build coal and prior year steam power services volume that did not repeat.
ge healthcare. healthcare is a leading global medical technology, pharmaceutical diagnostics and digital solutions innovator. our products, solutions and services span the continuum of patient care including screening, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring with the goal of empowering clinicians to deliver better care at lower cost. our customers include healthcare providers as well as researchers, including public, private and academic institutions. we sell our products through a combination of a global sales force and a network of channel partners, including distributors and other third parties. on january 3, 2023, ge completed the previously announced separation of its healthcare business, into a separate, independent publicly traded company. see note 28 for further information.
healthcare systems (hcs) - develops, manufactures, markets and services a broad suite of products and solutions used in the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients that is encompassed in imaging, ultrasound and patient care solutions. imaging includes magnetic resonance, computed tomography, molecular imaging, x-ray mammography, image-guided therapy systems, enterprise imaging, service capabilities and digital solutions. ultrasound includes consoles and probes, handheld devices, intraoperative imaging systems, visualization software, service capabilities and digital solutions. patient care solutions (pcs) includes consoles and probes, handheld devices, intraoperative imaging systems, visualization software, service capabilities, and digital solutions.
pharmaceutical diagnostics (pdx) - researches, manufactures and markets innovative imaging agents used during medical scanning procedures to highlight organs, tissue and functions inside the human body, to aid physicians in the early detection, diagnosis and management of disease through advanced in-vivo diagnostics. these products include both contrast imaging and molecular imaging agents.
biopharma - this business was sold on march 31, 2020. it delivered products, services and manufacturing solutions for drug discovery, biopharmaceutical production, and cellular and gene therapy technologies.
competition & regulation. healthcare competes with a variety of u.s. and non-u.s. manufacturers and services providers. customers require products and services that allow them to provide better access to healthcare, improve the affordability of care and improve the quality of patient outcomes. key factors affecting competition include technological innovations, productivity solutions, competitive pricing and the ability to provide lifecycle services. new technologies and solutions could make our products and services obsolete unless we continue to develop new and improved offerings. our products are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, as well as laws and regulations that apply to various reimbursement systems or other government funded healthcare programs.
significant trends & developments. market demand and rpo conversion remain positive despite inflationary and supply challenges continuing to impact the industry. global spending in healthcare is solid and expected to continue, particularly in public markets across europe and asia. we are experiencing strong order growth in our china equipment business due to government stimulus programs. overall, continued patient demand is leading providers to invest in products and services that increase productivity and reduce operating costs, an important dynamic as healthcare systems modernize post-pandemic and prepare for increased demand longer-term. actions of our supply chain, engineering and manufacturing teams, as well as proactive supplier engagement are driving fewer delays in securing key materials and have improved our ability to deliver products to our customers. however, shortages are still impacting our ability to deliver certain products. our expectation is that supply chain pressures will continue to improve. we continue to experience inflationary pressure within our supply chain, however, we have partially offset this pressure by adjusting pricing of our products, as well as managing discretionary and fixed cost in our business and prioritizing research and development investments.
we continue to grow and invest in precision health, with a focus on creating new products and digital solutions as well as expanding uses of existing offerings that are tailored to the different needs of our global customers. we introduced over 40 solutions that aim to improve patient outcomes and increase healthcare efficiency at the radiological society of north america's (rsna) 2022 annual meeting. for example, we announced a platform of four inventive components, which are signa one, a new anticipatory user interface with virtually no learning curve; air recon dl; air coils; and automated workflow solutions, that leverage ai and deep learning to ensure the smoothest scanning experience in magnetic resonance (mr) imaging. in january 2023 we announced we entered into an agreement to acquire imactis, an innovator in the rapidly growing field of computed tomography (ct) interventional guidance across an array of care areas. imactis created ct-navigationtm, an ergonomic universal solution that provides stereotactic needle guidance, enabling intuitive pre-planning and continuous control throughout a wide range of procedures, from diagnosis to treatment. we remain committed to innovate and invest to create more integrated, efficient and personalized precision care.

adjusted total corporate operating costs* excludes gains (losses) on purchases and sales of business interests, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, separation costs, gains (losses) on equity securities, impairments and our run-off insurance business profit. we believe that adjusting corporate costs to exclude the effects of items that are not closely associated with ongoing corporate operations provides management and investors with a meaningful measure that increases the period-to-period comparability of our ongoing corporate costs.
*non-gaap financial measure
2022 form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, revenues increased by $0.2 billion due to $0.5 billion of lower intersegment eliminations, partially offset by $0.2 billion of lower revenue in our run-off insurance business and $0.1 billion of lower revenue in our digital business. corporate operating profit decreased by $4.3 billion due to $1.8 billion of lower gains on equity securities, primarily related to our aercap and baker hughes investments. corporate operating profit also decreased as the result of $1.0 billion of separation costs and $0.5 billion of lower operating profit in our run-off insurance business, primarily due to a charge related to terminating several reinsurance contracts (see other items - insurance). in addition, operating profit decreased due to $0.8 billion of non-cash impairment charges related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as a result of reclassification of a portion of our steam power business to held for sale in the first quarter of 2022 (see notes 6 and 7). corporate operating profit also decreased due to $0.5 billion of higher restructuring and other charges primarily related to our corporate segment and $0.3 billion of charges from contracts and recoverability of assets in connection with the conflict between russia and ukraine and resulting sanctions, primarily within our aerospace and power businesses. these decreases were partially offset by $0.1 billion of lower losses on purchases and sales of business interests due to a $0.2 billion held for sale loss within our power segment in 2021.
adjusted total corporate operating costs* decreased by $0.5 billion primarily as the result of $0.3 billion of lower functional costs and $0.2 billion of lower costs associated with ehs and other items primarily driven by core reductions and favorability from interest rate and foreign exchange dynamics.
other consolidated information restructuring and separation costs. significant, higher-cost restructuring programs are excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for internal and external purposes; those excluded amounts are reported in restructuring and other charges for corporate. in addition, we incur costs associated with separation activities, which are also excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for internal and external purposes. see note 20 for further information on restructuring and separation costs.
interest and other financial charges were $1.6 billion, $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. the decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowings balances, partially offset by a lower allocation of interest expense to discontinued operations. inclusive of interest expense in discontinued operations, total interest and other financial charges were $1.7 billion, $2.5 billion and $3.0 billion for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. the primary components of interest and other financial charges are interest on short- and long-term borrowings.
debt extinguishment costs were $0.5 billion, $6.5 billion and $0.3 billion for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and
2020, respectively. during 2022, we executed a debt tender in the fourth quarter and incurred debt extinguishment costs of
$0.5 billion in the same quarter. the majority of these costs relate to the present value of accelerating future interest payments associated with the debt. as a result of these actions, we expect lower interest expense going forward.
postretirement benefit plans. refer to note 13 for information about our pension and retiree benefit plans.
provision (benefit) for income taxes              $476          $(286)          $(487)
for the year ended december 31, 2022, the income tax rate was 33.7% compared to 7.8% for the year ended december 31, 2021. the tax rate for 2022 reflects tax expense on pre-tax income. the tax rate for 2021 reflects a tax benefit on a pre-tax loss.
the provision (benefit) for income taxes was $0.5 billion and $(0.3) billion for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the increase in tax was primarily due to a decrease in tax benefit associated with lower debt extinguishment costs ($0.4 billion), the nonrecurrence of tax benefits associated with internal restructurings to recognize deductible stock and loan losses in excess of the amount offsetting aercap and baker hughes tax in 2021 ($0.2 billion) and the increase in pre-tax income excluding debt extinguishment and the net gains in 2022 on our interests in aercap and baker hughes ($0.2 billion). there was an insignificant tax effect on the net gains in aercap and baker hughes in both periods because of available capital losses.
for the year ended december 31, 2022, the adjusted income tax rate* was 21.6% compared to 20.2% for the year ended december 31, 2021. the adjusted income tax rate* increased primarily due to larger non-u.s. losses without a tax benefit.
absent additional taxes on global income enacted as part of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (u.s. tax reform) and non-u.s. losses without a tax benefit, our consolidated income tax provision is generally reduced because of the benefits of lower-taxed global operations as certain non-u.s. income is subject to local country tax rates that are below the u.s. statutory tax rate.
*non-gaap financial measure
2022 form 10-k the rate of tax on our profitable non-u.s. earnings is below the u.s. statutory tax rate because we have significant business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the u.s. statutory rate and because ge funds certain non-u.s. operations through foreign companies that are subject to low foreign taxes. most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-u.s. business operations. given u.s. tax reform, substantially all of our net prior unrepatriated earnings were subject to u.s. tax and accordingly we generally expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-u.s. cash without additional u.s. federal tax cost and any foreign withholding taxes on a repatriation to the u.s. would potentially be partially offset by a u.s. foreign tax credit. we reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis. in 2022, in connection with the execution of the company's plans to prepare for the spin-off of ge healthcare, we incurred $0.1 billion of tax due to repatriation of previously reinvested earnings.
a substantial portion of the benefit for lower-taxed non-u.s. earnings related to business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the u.s. statutory rate is derived from our aerospace operations located in singapore where the earnings are primarily taxed at a rate of 8% and our power operations located in switzerland where the earnings are taxed at between 17.4% and 18.6%.
the rate of tax on non-u.s. operations is increased, however, because we have losses in foreign jurisdictions where it is not likely that the losses can be utilized and no tax benefit is provided for those losses. non-u.s. losses also limit our ability to claim u.s. foreign tax credits on certain operations, further increasing the rate of tax on non-u.s. operations. in addition, as part of u.s. tax reform, the u.s. enacted a tax on "base eroding" payments from the u.s. we have taken restructuring actions to mitigate the impact from this provision. the u.s. also enacted a minimum tax on foreign earnings (global intangible low tax income). because we have tangible assets outside the u.s. and pay significant foreign taxes, we generally do not expect a significant increase in tax liability from this u.s. tax on foreign earnings. overall, these enacted provisions increase the rate of tax on our non-u.s. operations.

for the year ended december 31, 2022, the increase in expense from global operations compared to 2021 reflects larger non-u.s. losses without a tax benefit and the impact of revaluing deferred taxes as a result of tax law changes.
a more detailed analysis of differences between the u.s. federal statutory rate and the consolidated effective rate, as well as other information about our income tax provisions, is provided in the critical accounting estimates section and note 15.
research and development. we conduct research and development (r&d) activities to continually enhance our existing products and services, develop new products and services to meet our customers' changing needs and requirements, and address new market opportunities. in addition to funding r&d internally, we also receive funding externally from our customers and partners, which contributes to the overall r&d for the company.

(b) customer funded is principally u.s. government funded in our aerospace segment.
(c) 2022 expense excludes $166 million of costs offset by funding from government grants and incentives.
discontinued operations primarily comprise our ge capital aviation services (gecas) business, discontinued in 2021, our mortgage portfolio in poland, and other trailing assets and liabilities associated with prior dispositions. results of operations, financial position and cash flows for these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented and the notes to the financial statements have been adjusted on a retrospective basis. see note 2 for further information regarding our businesses in discontinued operations.
capital resources and liquidity financial policy. we intend to maintain a disciplined financial policy with a sustainable investment-grade long-term credit rating. in the fourth quarter of 2021, the company announced plans to form three industry-leading, global, investment-grade companies, each of which will determine their own financial policies, including capital allocation, dividend, mergers and acquisitions and share buyback decisions.
2022 form 10-k liquidity policy. we maintain a strong focus on liquidity and define our liquidity risk tolerance based on sources and uses to maintain a sufficient liquidity position to meet our business needs and financial obligations under both normal and stressed conditions. we believe that our consolidated liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs.
consolidated liquidity. our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash and cash equivalents, free cash flows* from our operating businesses, cash generated from asset sales and dispositions, and short-term borrowing facilities, including revolving credit facilities. cash generation can be subject to variability based on many factors, including seasonality, receipt of down payments on large equipment orders, timing of billings on long-term contracts, timing of aerospace-related customer allowances, market conditions and our ability to execute dispositions. total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $17.3 billion at december 31, 2022, of which $11.7 billion was held in the u.s. and $5.5 billion was held outside the u.s.
cash held in non-u.s. entities has generally been reinvested in active foreign business operations; however, substantially all of our unrepatriated earnings were subject to u.s. federal tax and, if there is a change in reinvestment, we would expect to be able to repatriate available cash (excluding amounts held in countries with currency controls) without additional federal tax cost. any foreign withholding tax on a repatriation to the u.s. would potentially be partially offset by a u.s. foreign tax credit. with regards to our announcement to form three public companies, the planning for and execution of the separations has impacted and is expected to continue to impact indefinite reinvestment. the impact of such changes will be recorded when there is a specific change in ability and intent to reinvest earnings.
cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at december 31, 2022 included $2.4 billion of cash held in countries with currency control restrictions (including a total of $0.1 billion in russia and ukraine) and $0.7 billion of restricted use cash. cash held in countries with currency controls represents amounts held in countries that may restrict the transfer of funds to the u.s. or limit our ability to transfer funds to the u.s. without incurring substantial costs. restricted use cash represents amounts that are not available to fund operations, and primarily comprised funds restricted in connection with certain ongoing litigation matters. excluded from cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $0.6 billion of cash in our run-off insurance business, which was classified as all other assets in the statement of financial position.
in connection with the program we launched in 2020 to fully monetize our baker hughes position over approximately three years, we received proceeds of $4.7 billion in 2022. in addition, we expect to fully monetize our stake in aercap over time.
following approval of a statutory permitted accounting practice in 2018 by our primary insurance regulator, the kansas insurance department (kid), we provided a total of $11.4 billion of capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries, including $2.0 billion in the first quarter of 2022. we expect to provide further capital contributions of approximately $3.6 billion through 2024 (of which approximately $1.8 billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of 2023, pending completion of our december 31, 2022 statutory reporting process). see note 12 for further information.
on march 6, 2022, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3 billion of our common stock. in connection with this authorization, we repurchased 13 million shares for a total of $1.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022.
borrowings. consolidated total borrowings were $32.4 billion and $35.2 billion at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, a decrease of $2.8 billion. the reduction in borrowings was driven by $10.1 billion of net maturities and repayments of debt including a $6.4 billion debt tender completed in the fourth quarter of 2022, and $1.0 billion primarily related to changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by $8.3 billion issued by ge healthcare in the fourth quarter of 2022.
we have in place committed revolving credit facilities totaling $14.4 billion at december 31, 2022, comprising a $10.0 billion unused back-up revolving syndicated credit facility and a total of $4.4 billion of bilateral revolving credit facilities.
ge healthcare actions. in the fourth quarter of 2022, as part of the financing for the planned spin-off, ge healthcare issued a total of $8.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured debt. these notes are obligations of ge healthcare and were guaranteed by ge until the completion of the spin-off on january 3, 2023. these notes remained with ge healthcare at the spin-off on january 3, 2023. see note 10 for further information.
also in the fourth quarter of 2022, in connection with the planned spin-off, ge healthcare entered into three new credit facilities totaling $5.5 billion. these credit facilities consist of a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate committed amount of $2.5 billion; a 364-day senior unsecured revolving facility in an aggregate committed amount of $1.0 billion; and a three-year senior unsecured term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion. these credit facilities remained with ge healthcare at the spin-off on january 3, 2023.
ge liability management actions. in the fourth quarter of 2022, ge used the majority of the proceeds from the senior unsecured debt issued by ge healthcare to complete a debt tender to repurchase a total of $6.4 billion of debt issued by ge or certain affiliates (and assumed or guaranteed by ge). in doing so, we incurred debt extinguishment costs of $0.5 billion, resulting in an aggregate purchase price of $7.0 billion. see note 10 for further information.

2022 form 10-k credit ratings and conditions. we have relied, and may continue to rely, on the short- and long-term debt capital markets to fund, among other things, a significant portion of our operations. the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. moody's investors service (moody's), standard and poor's global ratings (s&p), and fitch ratings (fitch) currently issue ratings on our short- and long-term debt. our credit ratings as of the date of this filing are set forth in the table below.

substantially all of the company's debt agreements in place at december 31, 2022 do not contain material credit rating covenants. our unused back-up revolving syndicated credit facility and certain of our bilateral revolving credit facilities contain a customary net debt-to-ebitda financial covenant, which we satisfied at december 31, 2022.
the company may from time to time enter into agreements that contain minimum ratings requirements. the following table provides a summary of the maximum estimated liquidity impact in the event of further downgrades below each stated ratings level.
our most significant contractual ratings requirements are related to ordinary course commercial activities. the timing within the quarter of the potential liquidity impact of these areas may differ, as can the remedies to resolving any potential breaches of required ratings levels.
foreign exchange and interest rate risk. as a result of our global operations, we generate and incur a significant portion of our revenues and expenses in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. such principal currencies include the euro, the chinese renminbi, the indian rupee and the british pound sterling, among others. the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on earnings was less than $0.1 billion for each of the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. see note 22 for further information about our risk exposures, our use of derivatives, and the effects of this activity on our financial statements.
exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques, including selective use of derivatives. we apply policies to manage each of these risks, including prohibitions on speculative activities. it is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies. to assess exposure to interest rate risk, we apply a +/- 100 basis points change in interest rates and keep that in place for the next 12 months. to assess exposure to currency risk of assets and liabilities denominated in other than their functional currencies, we evaluated the effect of a 10% shift in exchange rates against the u.s. dollar (usd). the analyses indicated that our 2022 consolidated net earnings would decline by less than $0.1 billion for interest rate risk and for foreign exchange risk.
libor reform. in connection with the transition away from the use of the london interbank offered rate (libor) as an interest rate benchmark, the ice benchmark administration limited (iba) plans to cease the remaining usd libor settings immediately following the libor publication on june 30, 2023. the company's most significant exposures to libor relate to preferred stock and certain floating-rate debt securities issued by the company, which use usd libor. such preferred stock and floating rate debt are governed by new york law. on december 16, 2022, the federal reserve board adopted a final rule that implements the adjustable interest rate (libor) act by identifying benchmark rates based on sofr (secured overnight financing rate) that will replace libor in certain financial contracts after june 30, 2023. we are in the process of managing the transition, and any financial impact will be accounted for under accounting standards update (asu) 2020-04, reference rate reform (topic 848): facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting.
2022 form 10-k statement of cash flows cash flows from continuing operations. the most significant source of cash in cfoa is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from equipment or services sales. the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities, and post retirement plans. ge measures itself on a free cash flows* basis. this metric includes cfoa plus investments in property, plant and equipment and additions to internal-use software; this metric excludes any cash received from dispositions of property, plant and equipment. we believe that investors may also find it useful to compare free cash flows* performance without the effects of cash flows for taxes related to business sales, contributions to the ge pension plan, discontinued factoring programs, operating activities related to our run-off insurance business, separation cash expenditures, corporate restructuring cash expenditures (associated with the separation-related program announced in october 2022) and eliminations related to our receivables factoring and supply chain finance programs. we believe this measure will better allow management and investors to evaluate the capacity of our operations to generate free cash flows*.

cash from operating activities was $5.9 billion in 2022, an increase of $5.0 billion compared to 2021, primarily due to: a decrease in financial services-related cash collateral paid net of settlements on interest rate derivative contracts of $1.0 billion, which is a standard market practice to minimize derivative counterparty exposures; an increase in net income (after adjusting for amortization of intangible assets, non-cash losses related to our interests in aercap and baker hughes and non-operating debt extinguishment costs) primarily in our aerospace business; an increase in cash from working capital of $2.3 billion; and an increase in cash from all other operating activities of $2.5 billion. the components of all other operating activities were as follows:
increase (decrease) in aerospace-related customer allowance accruals             $47              $514
net interest and other financial charges/(cash paid)                              45             (695)

*non-gaap financial measure
2022 form 10-k the cash impacts from changes in working capital compared to prior year were as follows: current receivables of $(2.8) billion, driven by higher volume partially offset by the impact of decreases in sales of receivables to third parties in 2021; inventories, including deferred inventory, of $(1.6) billion, driven by higher material purchases partially offset by higher liquidations; current contract assets of $0.4 billion, driven by higher billings on our long-term service agreements, partially offset by net favorable changes in estimated profitability; accounts payable and equipment project payables of $2.8 billion, driven by higher volume and lower disbursements related to purchases of materials in prior periods; and progress collections and current deferred income of $3.5 billion, driven by lower liquidations and higher collections, including $0.6 billion of increased customer collections on equipment orders to support production at our aerospace business.
cash from investing activities was $1.8 billion in 2022, a decrease of $21.9 billion compared to 2021, primarily due to: non-recurrence of sale proceeds of $22.4 billion from the combination of our gecas business with aercap in 2021; cash paid related to net settlements between our continuing operations and businesses in discontinued operations of $0.3 billion in 2022, primarily related to a capital contribution to bank bph, as compared to cash received of $1.6 billion in 2021, primarily from our gecas business (both components of all other investing activities); partially offset by non-recurrence of the acquisition of bk medical by our healthcare business of $1.5 billion in 2021; an increase in proceeds of $0.6 billion from the sales of our retained ownership interest in baker hughes and a decrease in net purchases of insurance investment securities of $0.4 billion. cash used for additions to property, plant and equipment and internal-use software, which are components of free cash flows*, was $1.5 billion in 2022 and $1.4 billion in 2021.
cash used for financing activities was $5.6 billion in 2022, a decrease of $39.7 billion compared to 2021, primarily due to: lower cash paid to repurchase long-term debt of $32.3 billion; ge healthcare's long-term debt issuance in connection with the spin-off of $8.3 billion and lower other net debt maturities of $0.9 billion; partially offset by an increase in purchases of ge common stock for treasury of $0.9 billion, the settlement of concept laser gmbh's interest in an aerospace technology joint venture of $0.2 billion and higher cash paid on derivatives hedging foreign currency debt of $0.2 billion (both components of all other financing activities). we paid cash to repurchase long-term debt of $6.9 billion and $39.2 billion, including cash received of $0.3 billion and cash paid of $7.2 billion related to debt extinguishment costs, excluding a non-cash debt basis adjustment of $(0.8) billion and $0.6 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
cash flows from discontinued operations. cash from investing activities in 2022 was primarily due to a capital contribution to bank bph from continuing operations. cash from operating activities and cash used for investing activities in 2021 was primarily due to cash generated from earnings in our gecas business and net settlements from gecas to continuing operations, respectively.
supply chain finance programs. we facilitate voluntary supply chain finance programs with third parties, which provide participating suppliers the opportunity to sell their ge receivables to third parties at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the third parties. at december 31, 2022 and 2021, included in accounts payable was $4.1 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, of supplier invoices that are subject to the third-party programs. total supplier invoices paid through these third-party programs were $7.6 billion and $6.9 billion for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. see note 11 for further information.
critical accounting estimates. accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. actual results in these areas could differ from management's estimates. see note 1 for further information on our most significant accounting policies.
revenue recognition on long-term services agreements. we have long-term service agreements with our customers predominately within our power and aerospace segments that require us to maintain the customers' assets over the contract terms, which generally range from 5 to 25 years. however, contract modifications that extend or revise contracts are not uncommon. we recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. this requires us to make estimates of customer payments expected to be received over the contract term as well as the costs to perform required maintenance services.
customers generally pay us based on the utilization of the asset (per hour of usage for example) or upon the occurrence of a major event within the contract such as an overhaul. as a result, a significant estimate in determining expected revenues of a contract is estimating how customers will utilize their assets over the term of the agreement. the estimate of utilization, which can change over the contract life, impacts both the amount of customer payments we expect to receive and our estimate of future contract costs. customers' asset utilization will influence the timing and extent of overhauls and other service events over the life of the contract. we generally use a combination of both historical utilization trends as well as forward-looking information such as market conditions and potential asset retirements in developing our revenue estimates.
to develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. in developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.
*non-gaap financial measure
2022 form 10-k we routinely review estimates under long-term service agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook. these revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. contract modifications that change the rights and obligations, as well as the nature, timing and extent of future cash flows, are evaluated for potential price concessions, contract asset impairments and significant financing to determine if adjustments of earnings are required before effectively accounting for a modified contract as a new contract.
we regularly assess expected billings adjustments and customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. we gain insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and fleet management strategies through close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. revisions may affect a long-term services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings.
on december 31, 2022, our net long-term service agreements balance of $(0.7) billion represents approximately (0.3)% of our total estimated life of contract billings of $202.2 billion. our contracts (on average) are approximately 18.7% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. revisions to our estimates of future billings or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by one percentage point would increase or decrease the long-term service agreements balance by $0.4 billion. billings collected on these contracts were $11.7 billion and $10.0 billion during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. see notes 1 and 8 for further information.
impairment of goodwill and other identified intangible assets. we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter. in assessing the possibility that a reporting unit's fair value has been reduced below its carrying amount due to the occurrence of events or circumstances between annual impairment testing dates, we consider all available evidence, including (i) the results of our impairment testing from the most recent testing date (in particular, the magnitude of the excess of fair value over carrying value observed), (ii) downward revisions to internal forecasts, decreases in market multiples (and the magnitude thereof) or changes to interest rates, if any, and (iii) declines in market capitalization below book value (and the magnitude and duration of those declines), if any.
we determine fair value for each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. we assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation. if multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.
valuations using the market approach are derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses. the selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the reporting units operate giving consideration to risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. a market approach is limited to reporting units for which there are publicly traded companies that have characteristics similar to our businesses.
under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each business. we derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts. discount rates used in our annual reporting unit valuations ranged from 11% to 21%.
estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results, internal forecasts, market observable pricing multiples of similar businesses and comparable transactions, possible control premiums, determining the appropriate discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions, and, if multiple approaches are being used, determining the appropriate weighting applied to each approach. it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods.
we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. determining whether an impairment loss has occurred requires the use of our internal forecast to estimate future cash flows and the useful life over which these cash flows will occur. to determine fair value, we use our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate. see notes 1 and 7 for further information.
insurance and investment contracts. refer to the other items - insurance section for further discussion of the accounting estimates and assumptions in our insurance reserves and their sensitivity to change. see notes 1 and 12 for further information.
pension assumptions. refer to note 13 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.
2022 form 10-k income taxes. our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. in addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. historically u.s. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. due to the enactment of u.s. tax reform in 2017, repatriations of available cash from foreign earnings are expected to be free of u.s. federal income tax but may incur withholding or state taxes. indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the company. most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-u.s. business operations. we reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis. in 2022, in connection with the execution of the company's plans to prepare for the spin-off of ge healthcare, we incurred $0.1 billion of tax due to repatriation of previously reinvested earnings.
we evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which heavily rely on estimates. we use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. amounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-u.s. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. of this, $0.1 billion at both december 31, 2022 and 2021, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our legacy financial services businesses. see other consolidated information - income taxes section and notes 1 and 15 for further information.
loss contingencies. loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments. when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. when there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. however, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. we regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. see note 24 for further information.
other items insurance. the run-off insurance operations of north american life and health (nalh) primarily include employers reassurance corporation (erac) and union fidelity life insurance company (uflic). erac primarily assumes long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. uflic primarily assumes long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from genworth financial inc. (genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004. our run-off insurance liabilities and annuity benefits primarily comprise a liability for future policy benefits for those insurance contract claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred. we regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions.
key portfolio characteristics long-term care insurance contracts. the long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes (e.g., lifetime benefit periods, inflation protection options, and joint life policies) that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits.
2022 form 10-k presented in the table below are gaap and statutory reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.

structured settlement annuities and life insurance contracts. we reinsure approximately 26,000 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 55. these structured settlement annuities were primarily underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-than- average life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins). unlike long- term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.
our life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. as of december 31, 2022, across our u.s. and canadian life insurance blocks, we reinsure approximately $59 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.4 million policies with an average attained age of 61. in 2022, our incurred claims were approximately $0.5 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $46,000. the covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20- and 30-year level term insurance. we anticipate a significant portion of the 20-year level term policies, which represent approximately 17% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2024 as the policies reach the end of their 20-year level premium period.
critical accounting estimates. our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.
future policy benefit reserves. future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross premiums based on actuarial assumptions including, but not limited to, those discussed in premium deficiency testing below. assumptions are locked-in throughout the remaining life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops.
claim reserves. claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. key inputs include actual known facts about the claim, such as the benefits available and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience factors. claim reserves are evaluated periodically for potential changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries, and any changes are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined.
premium deficiency testing. we annually perform premium deficiency testing in the third quarter in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio. the premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of unamortized capitalized acquisition costs, using current assumptions without provision for adverse deviation. a comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. the vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. in order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. our long-term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.
2022 form 10-k the primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency tests include:
morbidity. morbidity assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. for long-term care exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utilization (amount of available benefits expected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last).
rate of change in morbidity. our annual premium deficiency testing incorporates our best estimates of projected future changes in the morbidity rates reflected in our base claim cost curves. these estimates draw upon a number of inputs, some of which are subjective, and all of which are interpreted and applied in the exercise of professional actuarial judgment in the context of the characteristics specific to our portfolios. this exercise of judgment considers factors such as the work performed by internal and external independent actuarial experts engaged to advise us in our annual testing, the observed actual experience in our portfolios measured against our base projections, industry developments, and other trends, including advances in the state of medical care and health-care technology development.
mortality. mortality assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on published mortality tables as adjusted for the results of our experience studies and estimates of expected future mortality improvement.
discount rate. interest rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on expected future investment yields, net of related investment expenses and expected defaults. in estimating future investment yields, we consider the actual yields on our current investment securities held by our run-off insurance operations and the future rates at which we expect to reinvest any proceeds from investment security maturities, net of other operating cash flows, and the projected future capital contributions into our run-off insurance operations.
future long-term care premium rate increases. long-term care insurance policies allow the issuing insurance entity to increase premiums, or alternatively allow the policyholder the option to decrease benefits, with approval by state regulators, should actual experience emerge worse than what was projected when such policies were initially underwritten. as a reinsurer, we rely upon the primary insurers that issued the underlying policies to file proposed premium rate increases on those policies with the relevant state insurance regulators. while we have no direct ability to seek or to institute such premium rate increases, we often collaborate with the primary insurers in accordance with reinsurance contractual terms to file proposed premium rate increases. the amount of times that rate increases have occurred varies by ceding company. we consider recent experience of rate increase filings made by our ceding companies along with state insurance regulatory processes and precedents in establishing our current expectations.
terminations. terminations refers to the rate at which the underlying policies are cancelled due to either mortality, lapse (non-payment of premiums by a policyholder), or, in the case of long-term care insurance, benefit exhaustion. termination rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on the results of our experience studies and reflect actuarial judgment.
2022 premium deficiency testing. we completed our annual premium deficiency testing in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio in the third quarter of 2022. these procedures included updating certain experience studies since our last test completed in the third quarter of 2021, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. using updated assumptions, the 2022 premium deficiency testing results indicated a positive margin of about 10% of the related future policy benefit reserves recorded at september 30, 2022, or approximately equivalent to the 2021 premium deficiency testing results.
gaap reserve sensitivities. the following table provides sensitivities with respect to the impact of changes of key assumptions underlying our 2022 premium deficiency testing, exclusive of the impacts of converting our long-term care insurance claim cost projection models to first principles models as the conversion remains incomplete at the time of our 2022 premium deficiency testing. many of our assumptions are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. small changes in the amounts used in the sensitivities could result in materially different outcomes from those reflected below.

while higher assumed inflation, holding all other assumptions constant, would result in unfavorable impacts to the projected present value of future cash flows, it would be expected to be mitigated by a higher discount rate and more policies reaching contractual daily or monthly benefit caps.
our run-off insurance subsidiaries are required to prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting practices. statutory accounting practices are set forth by the national association of insurance commissioners (naic) as well as state laws, regulation and general administrative rules and differ in certain respects from gaap and would result in several of the sensitivities described in the table above being less impactful on our statutory reserves.
see capital resources and liquidity, other items - new accounting standards and notes 3 and 12 for further information related to our run-off insurance operations.
new accounting standards. the financial accounting standards board issued new guidance on accounting for long-duration insurance contracts that is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning january 1, 2023 and applied retrospectively to january 1, 2021 (i.e., the transition date). we will adopt the new guidance using the modified retrospective transition method where permitted. we expect adoption of the new guidance will significantly change the accounting for measurements of our long-duration insurance liabilities and reinsurance recoverables and materially affect our consolidated financial statements and require changes to our actuarial, accounting and financial reporting processes, systems, and internal controls. the new guidance requires cash flow assumptions used in the measurement of various insurance liabilities to be reviewed at least annually and updated if actual experience or other evidence indicates previous assumptions warrant revision with any required changes recorded in earnings. these changes will result in the elimination of premium deficiency testing and shadow adjustments. under the new guidance, the discount rate will be equivalent to the upper-medium grade (i.e., single a) fixed-income instrument yield reflecting the duration characteristics of our insurance liabilities and is required to be updated in each reporting period with changes recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci). as reinsurance recoverables are recognized in a manner consistent with the liabilities relating to the underlying reinsurance contracts, changes in reinsurance recoverables from updating the single a discount rate in each reporting period are also recognized in aoci. the allowance for credit losses on reinsurance recoverables will continue to be based on the locked-in discount rate for purposes of assessing changes in each reporting period. as such, movements in the gross reinsurance recoverable balance resulting from changes in the single a discount rate will not impact the allowance for credit losses. following the recapture transaction effective in the fourth quarter of 2022, as explained in note 12, the remaining reinsurance recoverables are not material.
in conjunction with the adoption of the new guidance, we are in process of converting our long-term care insurance claim cost projection models to first principles models that are based on more granular assumptions of expected future experience and will facilitate the new guidance's requirements.
2022 form 10-k we currently estimate a decrease in shareholders' equity at the transition date from adoption of the new guidance to be in an after-tax range of $7.0 billion to $8.0 billion, including approximately $5.5 billion to $6.0 billion in aoci and $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion in retained earnings. the decrease in aoci is primarily attributable to remeasuring our insurance liabilities and reinsurance recoverables using the single a discount rate required under the new guidance, which is lower than our current locked-in discount rate, and the removal of shadow adjustments. the decrease in retained earnings at the transition date is primarily attributable to certain long-term care insurance exposures where the projected present value of future cash flows exceeds the reserves at the transition date, based on the required lower level of grouping of contracts, combined with converting our long-term care insurance claim cost projection models to first principles models. as of december 31, 2022, we estimate the decrease in shareholders' equity to be reduced to approximately $3.0 billion to $4.0 billion, primarily due to changes in the market interest rate environment subsequent to the transition date.
the new guidance is only applicable to the measurements of our long-duration insurance liabilities under gaap. in addition, we do not expect changes to statutory insurance reserves, regulatory capital requirements or projected funding as a result of the implementation of the first principles models.
non-gaap financial measures. we believe that presenting non-gaap financial measures provides management and investors useful measures to evaluate performance and trends of the total company and its businesses. this includes adjustments in recent periods to gaap financial measures to increase period-to-period comparability following actions to strengthen our overall financial position and how we manage our business. in addition, management recognizes that certain non-gaap terms may be interpreted differently by other companies under different circumstances. in various sections of this report we have made reference to the following non-gaap financial measures in describing our (1) revenues, specifically organic revenues by segment; organic revenues; and equipment and services organic revenues and (2) profit, specifically organic profit and profit margin by segment; adjusted profit and profit margin; adjusted organic profit and profit margin; adjusted earnings (loss); adjusted income tax rate; and adjusted earnings (loss) per share (eps). the reasons we use these non-gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures follow.

we believe that adjusting profit to exclude the effects of items that are not closely associated with ongoing operations provides management and investors with a meaningful measure that increases the period-to-period comparability. gains (losses) and restructuring and other items are impacted by the timing and magnitude of gains associated with dispositions, and the timing and magnitude of costs associated with restructuring and other activities.

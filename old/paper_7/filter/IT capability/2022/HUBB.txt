executive overview of the business hubbell is a global manufacturer of quality electrical products and utility solutions for a broad range of customer and end market applications. we provide utility and electrical solutions that enable our customers to operate critical infrastructure reliably and efficiently, and we empower and energize communities through innovative solutions supporting energy infrastructure in front of the meter, on the edge, and behind the meter. in front of the meter is where utilities transmit and distribute energy to their customers. the edge connects utilities with owner/operators and allows energy and data to be distributed back and forth. behind the meter is where owners and operators of buildings, industrial facilities and other critical infrastructure consume energy. products are either sourced complete, manufactured or assembled by subsidiaries in the united states, canada, puerto rico, mexico, china, the uk, brazil, australia, spain and ireland. the company also participates in joint ventures in hong kong and the philippines, and maintains offices in singapore, italy, china, india, mexico, south korea, chile, and countries in the middle east. the company employed approximately 16,300 individuals worldwide as of december 31, 2022.
our reporting segments consist of the utility solutions segment, that has leading position in front of the meter and at the edge and the electrical solutions segment that is positioned behind the meter.
our long-term strategy is to serve our customers with reliable and innovative electrical and related infrastructure solutions with desired brands and high-quality service, delivered through a competitive cost structure; to complement organic revenue growth with acquisitions that enhance its product offerings; and to allocate capital effectively to create shareholder value.
our strategy to complement organic revenue growth with acquisitions is focused on acquiring assets that extend our capabilities, expand our product offerings, and present opportunities to compete in core, adjacent or complementary markets. our acquisition strategy also provides the opportunity to advance our revenue growth objectives during periods of weakness or inconsistency in our end-markets.
our strategy to deliver products through a competitive cost structure has resulted in past and ongoing restructuring and related activities. our restructuring and related efforts include the consolidation of manufacturing and distribution facilities, and workforce actions, as well as streamlining and consolidating our back-office functions. the primary objectives of our restructuring and related activities are to optimize our manufacturing footprint, cost structure, effectiveness and efficiency of our workforce.
productivity improvement also continues to be a key area of focus for the company and efforts to drive productivity complement our restructuring and related activities to minimize the impact of rising material costs and other administrative cost inflation. because material costs are approximately two thirds of our cost of goods sold, volatility in this area can significantly impact profitability. our goal is to have pricing and productivity programs that offset material and other inflationary cost increases as well as pay for investments in key growth areas.
productivity programs affect virtually all functional areas within the company by reducing or eliminating waste and improving processes. we continue to expand our efforts related to global product and component sourcing and supplier cost reduction programs. value engineering efforts, product transfers and the use of lean process improvement techniques are expected to continue to increase manufacturing efficiency. in addition, we continue to build upon the benefits of our enterprise resource planning system across all functions.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k our sales are also subject to market conditions that may cause customer demand for our products to be volatile and unpredictable, particularly in our electrical solutions segment. product demand can be affected by fluctuations in domestic and international economic conditions, as well as currency fluctuations, commodity costs, and a variety of other factors. we have recently experienced significant inflationary pressure across much of our business. we have had to take various pricing actions to cover the higher costs and protect our margin profile. because we expect inflation to remain a factor for the foreseeable future, we expect to continue these pricing actions subject, however, to demand and market conditions. accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our margins in response to the continuation or worsening of inflationary pressures. in addition, macroeconomic effects such as increases in interest rates and other measures taken by central banks and other policy makers could have a negative effect on overall economic activity that could reduce our customers' demand for our products.
discontinued operations on february 1, 2022, the company completed the sale of the commercial and industrial lighting business (the "c&i lighting business") to ge current, a daintree company. the disposal of the c&i lighting business met the criteria set forth in asc 205-20 to be presented as a discontinued operation. the c&i lighting businesses' results of operations and the related cash flows have been reclassified to income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of cash flows, respectively, for all periods presented. for additional information regarding this transaction and its effect on our financial reporting, see note 2 - discontinued operations, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, which note is incorporated herein by reference.
impact of the covid-19 pandemic notwithstanding a general improvement in conditions and reduction of adverse effects from the covid-19 pandemic that began in the first quarter of 2020, as of december 31, 2022 there continues to be significant uncertainty around the scope, severity, and duration of the pandemic, as well as the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to it and the overall impact on the u.s., global economies, and our operating results in future periods.
additionally, as economies have re-opened, global supply chains have struggled to keep up with increasing demand, and the resulting supply chain disruptions have, in certain cases, affected our ability to ship finished products in a timely manner. these supply chain disruptions and the increase in demand have also led to increased freight, labor and commodity costs, which are expected to persist into 2023.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k results of operationsour operations are classified into two reportable segments: utility solutions and electrical solutions. for a complete description of the company's segments, see part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. within these segments, hubbell serves customers in five primary end markets: utility t&d components, utility communications and controls, non-residential, residential, and industrial.
in 2022, net sales increased by 18.0% or $754 million and organic net sales(1) increased by 17.5% or $732 million on favorable price realization along with higher volumes, as further discussed in segment results below. operating margin increased in 2022, by 160 basis points and adjusted operating margin(1) increased by 140 basis points, driven by price realization that exceeded material cost inflation, higher unit volume and savings from our restructuring and related actions, partially offset by higher freight, logistics and manufacturing costs, as well as other inflationary cost increases in excess of productivity and increased investment in our business. net income from continuing operations attributable to hubbell increased by 40.1% in 2022 compared to the prior year and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 41.6%. adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to hubbell(1) increased by 30.3% in 2022 compared to the prior year and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations(1) increased by 31.9% in 2022.
(1) organic net sales, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to hubbell and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are non-gaap financial measures. see "adjusted operating measures" below for a reconciliation to the comparable gaap financial measures.
(2) free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure. see "adjusted operating measures" and "financial condition, liquidity and capital resources - cash flow" below for a reconciliation to the comparable gaap financial measure.

hubbell incorporated - form 10-k adjusted operating measures in the following discussion of results of operations, we refer to "adjusted" operating measures. we believe those adjusted measures, which exclude the impact of certain costs, gains and losses, may provide investors with useful information regarding our underlying performance from period to period and allow investors to understand our results of operations without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance.
adjusted operating measures exclude amortization of all intangible assets associated with our business acquisitions, including inventory step-up amortization associated with those acquisitions. the intangible assets associated with our business acquisitions arise from the allocation of the purchase price using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with accounting standards codification 805, "business combinations." these assets consist primarily of customer relationships, developed technology, trademarks and tradenames, and patents, as reported in note 7 - goodwill and other intangible assets, under the heading "total definite-lived intangibles" within the notes to consolidated financial statements.
the company believes that the exclusion of these non-cash expenses (i) enhances management's and investors' ability to analyze underlying business performance, (ii) facilitates comparisons of our financial results over multiple periods, and (iii) provides more relevant comparisons of our results with the results of other companies as the amortization expense associated with these assets may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the timing, size, nature, and number of acquisitions. although we exclude amortization of these acquired intangible assets and inventory step-up from our non-gaap results, we believe that it is important for investors to understand that revenue generated, in part, from such intangibles is included within revenue in determining adjusted net income from continuing operations.
•2021 - a $16.8 million pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of long-term debt from the redemption of all of the company's outstanding 3.625% senior notes due 2022 in the aggregate principal amount of $300 million and a $6.9 million loss on the disposal of a business.
•income tax effects of the above adjustments which are calculated using the statutory tax rate, taking into consideration the nature of the item and the relevant taxing jurisdiction, unless otherwise noted.
these items are reported in total other expense (below operating income) in the consolidated statement of income. the company excludes these non-core items because we believe it enhances management's and investors' ability to analyze underlying business performance and facilitates comparisons of our financial results over multiple periods. refer to the reconciliation of non-gaap measures presented below, note 4 - business acquisitions and dispositions, note 12 - retirement benefits, and note 13 - debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information.
organic net sales, a non-gaap measure, represents net sales according to u.s. gaap, less net sales from acquisitions and divestitures during the first twelve months of ownership or divestiture, respectively, less the effect of fluctuations in net sales from foreign currency exchange. the period-over-period effect of fluctuations in net sales from foreign currency exchange is calculated as the difference between local currency net sales of the prior period translated at the current period exchange rate as compared to the same local currency net sales translated at the prior period exchange rate. we believe this measure provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of the underlying operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions and foreign currency as these activities can obscure underlying trends. when comparing net sales growth between periods excluding the effects of acquisitions, business dispositions and currency exchange rates, those effects are different when comparing results for different periods. for example, because net sales from acquisitions are considered inorganic from the date we complete an acquisition through the end of the first year following the acquisition, net sales from such acquisition are reflected as organic net sales thereafter.
there are limitations to the use of non-gaap measures. non-gaap measures do not present complete financial results. we compensate for this limitation by providing a reconciliation between our non-gaap financial measures and the respective most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap. because non-gaap financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-gaap financial measures having the same or similar names. these financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, or alternative measures of, reported gaap financial results, and should be viewed in conjunction with the most comparable gaap financial measures and the provided reconciliations thereto. we believe, however, that these non-gaap financial measures, when viewed together with our gaap results and related reconciliations, provide a more complete understanding of our business. we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.

free cash flow is a non-gaap measure that we define as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. management believes that free cash flow provides useful information regarding hubbell's ability to generate cash without reliance on external financing. in addition, management uses free cash flow to evaluate the resources available for investments in the business, strategic acquisitions and further strengthening the balance sheet.
cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $636.2 million in 2022 compared to $513.7 million in 2021. the increase compared to the prior year is primarily due to higher net income, partially offset by changes in the components of working capital, as we invested in working capital to serve customer demand and growth in our order backlog.
cash provided by investing activities was $18.1 million in 2022 compared to cash used of $72.1 million in 2021. that change was driven by $332.8 million in net proceeds from the disposal of the c&i lighting business, partially offset by cash used of $177.1 million to acquire pcx holdings llc ("pcx"), ripley tools, llc and nooks hill road, llc (collectively, "ripley tools") and ref automation limited and ref alabama inc. (collectively "ref") during 2022 and additional capital expenditures as we continue to invest in capacity expansion, automation and productivity initiatives.
cash used in financing activities was $437.1 million in 2022 as compared to cash used of $433.0 million in 2021. the change in cash flows from financing activities primarily reflects an increase of $170.8 million of the company's share repurchases in 2022 compared to 2021, partially offset by change in net borrowings.
the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on cash was $8.8 million in 2022 as compared to a unfavorable effect of $3.0 million in 2021. the unfavorable impact in 2022 was primarily related to a weaker canadian dollar and british pound compared to the u.s. dollar.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k investments in the business investments in our business include cash outlays for the acquisition of businesses as well as expenditures to maintain the operation of our equipment and facilities and invest in restructuring activities.
in july 2022, the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of pcx for a cash purchase price of approximately $112.8 million, net of cash acquired. pcx is a leading designer and manufacturer of factory built modular power solutions for applications in the data center market. this business is reported in the electrical solutions segment. in july 2022, the company also acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of ripley tools for a cash purchase price of approximately $50.1 million, net of cash acquired. ripley tools is a leading manufacturer of cable and fiber prep tools and test equipment that serves both the utility and communications markets. this business is reported in the utility solutions segment.
in november 2022, the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of ref for a cash purchase price of $14.1 million. ref designs and manufactures electrical power components utilizing high-volume precision machining, as well as custom fabricated structural products and assemblies for the oem, industrial and renewables markets. this business is reported in the electrical solutions segment.
we continue to invest in restructuring and related programs to maintain a competitive cost structure, to drive operational efficiencies and to mitigate the impact of rising material costs and administrative cost inflation. we expect our investment in restructuring and related activities to continue in 2023 as we continue to invest in previously initiated actions and initiate further footprint consolidation and other cost reduction initiatives.
in connection with our restructuring and related actions, we have incurred restructuring costs as defined by u.s. gaap, which are primarily severance and employee benefits, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation, as well as facility closure, contract termination and certain pension costs that are directly related to restructuring actions. we also incurred restructuring-related costs, which are costs associated with our business transformation initiatives, including the consolidation of back-office functions and streamlining of our processes, and certain other costs and gains associated with restructuring actions. we refer to these costs on a combined basis as "restructuring and related costs", which is a non-gaap measure. we believe this non-gaap measure provides investors with useful information regarding our underlying performance from period to period. restructuring costs are predominantly settled in cash from our operating activities and are generally settled within one year, with the exception of asset impairments, which are non-cash.
the table below presents the restructuring and related costs incurred in 2022, additional expected costs, and the expected completion date of restructuring actions that have been initiated as of december 31, 2022 and in prior years (in millions):

during 2022, we invested $129.3 million in capital expenditures, an increase of $39.1 million as compared to 2021 as we increased capital investments to expand capacity, optimize footprint and implement automation and productivity initiatives.
stock repurchase program on october 23, 2020 the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program (the "october 2020 program") that authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of common stock and expires in october 2023. at december 31, 2022 our remaining share repurchase authorization under the october 2020 program is $106.7 million. on october 21, 2022 the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of common stock and expires in october 2025. the company repurchased $182.0 million and $11.2 million of shares of common stock, in 2022 and 2021, respectively. when combined with the $106.7 million of remaining share repurchase authorization under the october 2020 program, we have a total share repurchase authorization remaining of approximately $406.7 million as of december 31, 2022. subject to numerous factors, including market conditions and alternative uses of cash, we may conduct discretionary repurchases through open market or privately negotiated transactions, which may include repurchases under plans complying with rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k debt to capital at december 31, 2022 and 2021, the company had $1,437.9 million and $1,435.5 million, respectively, of long-term debt outstanding, net of unamortized discount and the unamortized balance of capitalized debt issuance costs. at december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021 the company had no long-term debt with maturities due within the next twelve months.
borrowings under revolving credit facility on march 12, 2021, the company, as borrower, and its subsidiaries hubbell power holdings s.à r.l. and harvey hubbell holdings s.à r.l., each as a subsidiary borrower (collectively, the "subsidiary borrowers") entered into a new five-year credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders and jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as administrative agent, that provides a $750 million committed revolving credit facility (the "2021 credit facility"). commitments under the 2021 credit facility may be increased to an aggregate amount not to exceed $1.25 billion. the 2021 credit facility includes a $50 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit. the sum of the dollar amount of loans and letters of credits to the subsidiary borrowers under the 2021 credit facility may not exceed $75 million. there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2021 credit facility at december 31, 2022 or december 31, 2021.
the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the 2021 credit facility is (i) either the alternate base rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility) or (ii) the adjusted libor rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility) plus an applicable margin based on the company's credit ratings. all revolving loans outstanding under the 2021 credit facility will be due and payable on march 12, 2026.
the 2021 credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring that, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, the ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization shall not be greater than 65%. the company was in compliance with this covenant as of december 31, 2022.
unsecured senior notes on march 12, 2021, the company completed a public offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.300% senior notes due 2031 (the "2031 notes" and collectively with those described below, the "notes"). the net proceeds from the offering were approximately $295.5 million after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by the company. the 2031 notes bear interest at a rate of 2.300% per annum from march 12, 2021. interest on the 2031 notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 of each year, beginning on september 15, 2021. the 2031 notes will mature on march 15, 2031.
the company used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2031 notes, together with cash on hand, on april 2, 2021 to redeem in full all of the company's outstanding 3.625% senior notes due in 2022 for an aggregate principal amount of $300 million, which had a stated maturity date of november 15, 2022, and to pay the premium and accrued interest in respect thereof. the redemption of the 2022 notes resulted in a $16.8 million loss on extinguishment that was recognized in the second quarter of 2021.
the carrying value of the notes, net of unamortized discount and the unamortized balance of capitalized debt issuance costs, was $1,437.9 million and $1,435.5 million at december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, respectively.
the notes are callable at any time at specified prices and are only subject to accelerated payment prior to maturity upon customary events of default, or upon a change in control triggering event as defined in the indenture governing the notes, as supplemented. the company was in compliance with all covenants (none of which are financial) as of december 31, 2022.
◦$2.8 million at december 31, 2022 and $1.6 million at december 31, 2021, respectively, of borrowings to support our international operations in china as well as $1.9 million and $8.1 million of other short term debt at december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, respectively, to support other operations.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k net debt, defined as total debt less cash and investments, is a non-gaap measure that may not be comparable to definitions used by other companies. we consider net debt to be a useful measure of our financial leverage for evaluating the company's ability to meet its funding needs.
the following table sets forth the reconciliation of net debt at december 31, 2022 and 2021:
total hubbell incorporated shareholders' equity           2,360.9            2,229.8
total capital (gaap measure)                             $3,803.5           $3,675.0
total debt to total capital (gaap measure)                     38    %            39    %

net debt to total capital (non-gaap measure)                   24    %            29    %
liquidity we measure liquidity on the basis of our ability to meet short-term and long-term operational funding needs, to fund additional investments, including acquisitions, and to make dividend payments to shareholders. significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, cash dividend payments, stock repurchases, access to bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms.
in 2022, we returned capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. these activities were funded primarily with cash flows from operations.
◦in 2022, cash used for share repurchases was $182.0 million.
we also require cash outlays to fund our operations, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements to accommodate anticipated levels of business activity, as well as our rate of cash dividends and potential future acquisitions. we have contractual obligations for long-term debt, operating leases, purchase obligations, and certain other long-term liabilities, including defined benefit retirement obligations and other benefits. refer to note 13 - debt and note 24 - leases in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details on anticipated cash outflows. as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act ("tcja"), we also have an obligation to fund, by annual installments through 2025, the company's liability for the transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. contractual purchase obligations for years subsequent to december 31, 2022 include approximately, $590 million in 2023. contractual purchase obligations beyond 2023 are not significant.
our purchase obligations include amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price, quantity, delivery and termination liability. these obligations primarily consist of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements and commitments for equipment purchases. as of december 31, 2022, we have $42.1 million of uncertain tax positions reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. we are unable to make a reasonable estimate regarding the timing of settlement of these uncertain tax positions and, as a result, they have been excluded from the disclosure. see note 14 - income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
our sources of funds and available resources to meet these funding needs are as follows:
◦cash flows from operating activities and existing cash resources: in addition to our cash flows from operating activities, we also had $440.5 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2022, of which approximately 35% was held inside the united states and the remainder held internationally.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k
◦our 2021 credit facility provides a $750.0 million committed revolving credit facility and commitments under the 2021 credit facility may be increased (subject to certain conditions) to an aggregate amount not to exceed $1.250 billion. annual commitment fees to support availability under the 2021 credit facility are not material. although not the principal source of liquidity, we believe our 2021 credit facility is capable of providing significant financing flexibility at reasonable rates of interest and is an attractive alternative source of funding in the event that commercial paper markets experience disruption. however, an increase in usage of the 2021 credit facility related to growth or a significant deterioration in the results of our operations or cash flows could cause our borrowing costs to increase and/or our ability to borrow could be restricted. we have not entered into any guarantees that could give rise to material unexpected cash requirements. the full $750.0 million of borrowing capacity under the 2021 credit facility was available to the company at december 31, 2022.
◦in addition to our commercial paper program and existing revolving credit facility, we also have the ability to obtain additional financing through the issuance of long-term debt. considering our current credit rating, historical earnings performance, and financial position, we believe that we would be able to obtain additional long-term debt financing on attractive terms.
◦the company also maintains other lines of credit that are primarily used to support the issuance of letters of credit. interest rates and other terms of borrowing under these lines of credit vary from country to country, depending on local market conditions. at december 31, 2022 and 2021, total availability under these lines was $55.8 million and $30.0 million, respectively, of which $31.7 million and $23.2 million was utilized to support letters of credit and the remaining amount was unused. the annual commitment fees associated with these lines of credit are not material.
pension funding status we have a number of funded and unfunded non-contributory u.s. and foreign defined benefit pension plans. benefits under these plans are generally provided based on either years of service and final average pay or a specified dollar amount per year of service. the funded status of our qualified, defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including future returns on invested pension assets, the level of market interest rates, employee earnings and employee demographics.
in 2022, the company recognized a settlement loss within continuing operations relating to retirees that elected to receive lump-sum distributions from the company's defined benefit pension plans of $7.0 million. this charge was the result of lump-sum payments which exceeded the threshold for settlement accounting under u.s. gaap in such year.
changes in the value of the defined benefit plan assets and liabilities will affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. although differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results are no longer deferred for balance sheet purposes, deferral is still permitted for pension expense purposes. unrecognized gains and losses in excess of an annual calculated minimum amount (the greater of 10% of the projected benefit obligation or 10% of the market value of assets) have been amortized and recognized in net periodic pension cost. effective january 1, 2020, the amortization of unrecognized gains and losses of all of the company's qualified defined benefit pension plans is recognized over the remaining life expectancy of participants, as all participants are considered inactive as a result of plan amendments. during 2022 and 2021, we recorded $10.8 million and $10.8 million, respectively, of pension expense related to the amortization of these unrecognized losses.
in 2022 and 2021, we contributed $12.5 million and $0.1 million, respectively, to our qualified foreign and domestic defined benefit pension plans. these contributions have improved the funded status of those plans. although not required by erisa and the internal revenue code, the company may elect to make a voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic defined benefit pension plan in 2023. the anticipated level of pension funding in 2023 is not expected to have a significant impact on our overall liquidity.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k assumptions the following assumptions were used to determine projected pension and other benefit obligations at the measurement date and the net periodic benefit costs for the year:
pension benefits                         other benefits
weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at december 31, discount rate                                                                                                  5.46    %      2.79    %               5.50    %      2.90    %
weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended december 31, discount rate                                                                                                  2.79    %      2.47    %               2.90    %      2.50    %
expected return on plan assets                                                                                 4.59    %      4.66    %                     n/a            n/a rate of compensation increase                                                                                  0.08    %      0.24    %               3.87    %      3.99    %
at the end of each year, we estimate the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets based on the strategic asset allocation for our plans. in making this determination, we utilize expected rates of return for each asset class based upon current market conditions and expected risk premiums for each asset class. a one percentage point change in the expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets would have an impact of approximately $5.2 million on 2023 pretax pension expense. the expected long-term rate of return is applied to the fair market value of pension fund assets to produce the expected return on fund assets that is included in pension expense.
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets was recognized at december 31, 2022 for balance sheet purposes, but continues to be deferred for expense purposes. the net deferral of past asset gains (losses) ultimately affects future pension expense through the amortization of gains (losses) with an offsetting adjustment to hubbell shareholders' equity through accumulated other comprehensive loss.
at the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of our pension plan liabilities. for our u.s. and canadian pension plans, this discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows associated with our benefit obligations to the expected cash flows of a hypothetical portfolio of high quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that closely match the expected funding period of our pension liabilities. as of december 31, 2022, we used a discount rate of 5.50% for our u.s. pension plans compared to a discount rate of 2.90% used in 2021. for our canadian pension plan, we used a discount rate of 5.01% in 2022, compared to a 2.98% discount rate used in 2021.
for our uk pension plan the discount rate was derived using a full yield curve and uses plan specific cash flows. the derived discount rate is the single discount rate equivalent to discounting these liability cash flows at the term-dependent spot rates of aa corporate bonds. this methodology resulted in a december 31, 2022 discount rate for the uk pension plan of 5.00% as compared to a discount rate of 1.80% used in 2021.
in 2021 and 2022 we used the pri-2012 mortality table to calculate the present value of our pension plan liabilities and adopted the mp-2021 projection scale. the pri-2012 mortality table with adjustment for collar as appropriate and generational projection from 2012 using scale mp-2021 was chosen as the best estimate based on the observed and anticipated experience of the plans after considering alternative tables.
other post-employment benefits ("opeb")
the company also has a number of health care and life insurance benefit plans covering eligible employees who reached retirement age while working for the company. these benefits have been discontinued for substantially all future retirees. these plans are not funded and, therefore, no assumed rate of return on assets is required. we use a similar methodology to derive the discount rate for our post employment benefit plan obligations that we use for our pension plans. as of december 31, 2022, the company used a discount rate of 5.50% to determine the projected benefit obligation compared to a discount rate of 2.90% used in 2021.
in accordance with the accounting guidance for retirement benefits, we recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss, within hubbell shareholders' equity, a benefit, net of tax, of $5.5 million in 2022 and $3.4 million in 2021, respectively, related to the annual remeasurement of the opeb plans and the amortization of prior service credits and net actuarial gains.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements are defined as any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity that is not included in our consolidated results is a party, under which we, whether or not a party to the arrangement, have, or in the future may have: (1) an obligation under a direct or indirect guarantee or similar arrangement, (2) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity for such assets, (3) an obligation or liability, including a contingent obligation or liability, under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument, except that it is excluded from the scope of fasb asc topic 815, or (4) an obligation, including a contingent obligation, arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that is held by, and material to, the company, where such entity provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with, the company.
we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined above which have or are likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources or cash flows.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k critical accounting estimates note 1 - significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements.
use of estimates we are required to make assumptions and estimates and apply judgments in the preparation of our financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. we base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors deemed relevant by management, such as projections of future performance. we continually review these estimates and their underlying assumptions to ensure they are appropriate for the circumstances. changes in estimates and assumptions used by us could have a material impact on our financial results, and actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. we believe that the following estimates are among the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. these items utilize assumptions and estimates about the effect of future events that are inherently uncertain and are based on our judgment.
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when performance obligations identified under the terms of contracts with its customers are satisfied, which generally occurs, for products, upon the transfer of control in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions of the sale. the majority of the company's revenue associated with products is recognized at a point in time when the product is shipped to the customer, with a relatively small amount of transactions in the utility solutions segment recognized upon delivery of the product at the contractually specified destination. revenue from service contracts and post-shipment performance obligations is approximately two percent of total annual consolidated net revenue and those service contracts and post-shipment obligations are primarily within the utility solutions segment. revenue from service contracts and post-shipment performance obligations is recognized when or as those obligations are satisfied. the company primarily offers assurance-type standard warranties that do not represent separate performance obligations and on occasion will separately offer and price extended warranties that are separate performance obligations for which the associated revenue is recognized over-time based on the extended warranty period. the company records amounts billed to customers for reimbursement of shipping and handling costs within revenue. shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of goods sold. sales taxes and other usage-based taxes are excluded from revenue.
the company has certain arrangements that require us to estimate at the time of sale the amounts of variable consideration that should not be recorded as revenue as certain amounts are not expected to be collected from customers, as well as an estimate of the value of the product to be returned. the company principally relies on historical experience, specific customer agreements and anticipated future trends to estimate these amounts at the time of shipment and to reduce the transaction price. these arrangements include sales discounts and allowances based on sales volumes, specific programs and special pricing allowances, and returned goods, as are customary in the electrical products industry. customer returns have historically been approximately one percent of gross sales.
inventory valuation inventories in the u.s. are primarily valued at the lower of lifo cost or market, while non-u.s. inventories are valued at the lower of fifo cost or market. we routinely evaluate the carrying value of our inventories to ensure they are carried at the lower of lifo or fifo cost or market value. such evaluation is based on our judgment and use of estimates, including sales forecasts, gross margins for particular product groupings, planned dispositions of product lines, technological events and overall industry trends. in addition, the evaluation is based on changes in inventory management practices which may influence the timing of exiting products and method of disposing of excess inventory.
excess inventory is generally identified by comparing future expected inventory usage to actual on-hand quantities. inventory values are reduced for on-hand inventory in excess of pre-defined usage forecasts. forecast usage is primarily determined by projecting historical (actual) sales and inventory usage levels forward to future periods. changes in these estimates may necessitate future adjustments to inventory values.
employee benefits costs and funding we sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension, defined contribution and other postretirement plans. significant assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on the pension fund assets, rate of increase in employee compensation levels and health care cost increase projections. these assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement dates. further discussion of the assumptions used in 2022 and 2021 are included above under "pension funding status" and in note 12 - retirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. additionally, deferred tax assets are required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets are the forecast of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets, and future reversals of deferred tax liabilities. failure to achieve forecasted taxable income can affect the ultimate realization of net deferred tax assets.
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. the internal revenue service ("irs") and other tax authorities routinely review our tax returns. these audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. the company records uncertain tax positions when it has determined that it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the company uses the criteria established in the accounting guidance to determine whether an item meets the definition of more-likely-than-not. the company's policy is to recognize these uncertain tax positions when the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, when the statute of limitations has expired or upon settlement. in management's opinion, adequate provision has been made for potential adjustments arising from any examinations. see note 14 - income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill, and indefinite-lived intangible assets our long-lived assets include land, buildings, equipment, molds and dies, software, goodwill and other intangible assets. long-lived assets, other than land, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. goodwill represents purchase price in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. intangible assets primarily consist of patents, tradenames, developed technology and customer related intangibles.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment unless circumstances dictate the need for more frequent assessment. we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing as of april 1st of each year. the accounting guidance provides entities an option of performing a qualitative assessment (the "step-zero" test) before performing a quantitative analysis. if the entity determines, on the basis of certain qualitative factors, that it is more-likely-than-not that the goodwill is not impaired, the entity would not need to proceed to the quantitative goodwill impairment testing process as prescribed in the guidance. if the company does not elect to complete the qualitative assessment, the company completes the quantitative assessment whereby the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value.
the organizational changes within electrical solutions effective january 1, 2022 resulted in a change in the company's reporting units. as a result, the company performed an interim goodwill impairment assessment as of january 1, 2022. for the three reporting units within the electrical solutions segment, the company elected to utilize the quantitative goodwill impairment testing process, as permitted in the accounting guidance, by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values. the company did not have any reporting units at risk of failing the quantitative impairment test as the excess of the implied fair value exceeded the carrying value of each of the reporting units. additionally, the company did not have any reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
the company also completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of april 1, 2022. the company applied the step-zero test to one of its four reporting units. based on the qualitative assessment, the company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of this reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, further quantitative analysis was not required. for the other three reporting units, the company elected to utilize the quantitative goodwill impairment testing process, as permitted in the accounting guidance, by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting units to their carrying values. as of april 1, 2022, the impairment testing resulted in implied fair values of our reporting units that exceeded the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill. the range of fair value in excess of carrying value, including goodwill, of the reporting units was 57% to 308%. the company did not have any reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
hubbell incorporated - form 10-k the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future discounted cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions, including assumptions about secular economic and market conditions, such as increases in interest rates, the potential continuing effects of the covid-19 pandemic, impacts to the supply chain and higher inflation. we use internal discounted cash flow models to estimate fair value. these cash flow estimates are derived from historical experience, third-party end market data, and future long-term business plans and include assumptions of future sales growth, gross margin, operating margin, terminal growth rate, and the application of an appropriate discount rate. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. we corroborate the values determined from our discounted cash flow models by reconciling the sum of the estimated fair values of each reporting unit to our market capitalization at the testing date, including consideration of a control premium. we have not recorded any goodwill impairments since the initial adoption of the accounting guidance in 2002.
the identification and measurement of impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves either an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired or a quantitative assessment whereby the estimated fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value. if it is more-likely-than-not that the asset is impaired, the fair value of the indefinite lived intangibles will be determined using discounted cash flow estimates. if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the estimated fair value, the carrying value will be reduced to the estimated fair value. for the company's annual impairment test as of april 1, 2022, the company elected to utilize the quantitative impairment testing process as permitted in the accounting guidance. the fair value was determined utilizing an income approach (relief from royalty method). significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets including assumptions for future revenues, discount rates, royalty rates, and other assumptions, including assumptions about secular economic and market conditions, such as the potential continuing effects of the covid-19 pandemic. significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment for each indefinite-lived intangible asset. as of april 1, 2022, the impairment testing resulted in fair values for each indefinite-lived intangible asset that significantly exceeded the carrying values and there were no indefinite-lived intangible assets at risk of failing the quantitative impairment test. we did not record any impairments related to indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2022, 2021, or 2020.

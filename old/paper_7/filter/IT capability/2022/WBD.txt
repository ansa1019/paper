item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes. this section provides additional information regarding our businesses, current developments, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, contractual commitments, critical accounting policies, and estimates that require significant judgment and thus have the most significant potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. this discussion and analysis is intended to better allow investors to view the company from management's perspective.
this section provides an analysis of our financial results for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended december 31, 2021. a discussion of our results of operations and liquidity for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended december 31, 2020 can be found under item 7 in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2021, filed on february 24, 2022, which is available free of charge on the sec's website at www.sec.gov and our investor relations website at ir.wbd.com. the information contained on our website is not part of this annual report on form 10-k and is not incorporated by reference herein.
business overview on april 8, 2022, discovery, a global media company that provides content across multiple distribution platforms, including linear, free-to-air, and broadcast television, authenticated go applications, digital distribution arrangements, content licensing arrangements, and dtc subscription products, completed its merger with the wm business of at&t and changed its name from "discovery, inc." to "warner bros. discovery, inc." on april 11, 2022, our shares started trading on nasdaq under the trading symbol wbd. (see note 3 and note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
warner bros. discovery is a premier global media and entertainment company that combines the warnermedia business's premium entertainment, sports and news assets with discovery's leading non-fiction and international entertainment and sports businesses, thus offering audiences a differentiated portfolio of content, brands and franchises across television, film, streaming and gaming. some of our iconic brands and franchises include warner bros. pictures group, warner bros. television group, dc, hbo, hbo max, discovery channel, discovery+, cnn, hgtv, food network, tnt, tbs, tlc, own, warner bros. games, batman, superman, wonder woman, harry potter, looney tunes, hanna-barbera, game of thrones, and the lord of the rings. for a discussion of our global portfolio see our business overview set forth in item 1, "business" in this annual report on form 10-k.
in connection with the merger, we have announced and taken actions to implement projects to achieve cost synergies for the company. we finalized the framework supporting our ongoing restructuring and transformation initiatives during 2022, which include, among other things, strategic content programming assessments, organization restructuring, facility consolidation activities, and other contract termination costs. we expect that we will incur approximately $4.1 - $5.3 billion in pre-tax restructuring charges. of the total expected pre-tax restructuring charges, we expect total cash expenditures to be $1.0 - $ 1.5 billion. we incurred $3.8 billion of pre-tax restructuring charges during the year ended december 31, 2022. while our restructuring efforts are ongoing, the restructuring program is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2024.
in connection with the merger, we reevaluated and changed our segment presentation and reportable segments during 2022. as of december 31, 2022, we classified our operations in three reportable segments:
•studios, consisting primarily of the production and release of feature films for initial exhibition in theaters, production and initial licensing of television programs to third parties and our networks/dtc services, distribution of our films and television programs to various third party and internal television and streaming services, distribution through the home entertainment market (physical and digital), related consumer products and themed experience licensing, and interactive gaming;
•networks, consisting principally of our domestic and international television networks; and
our segment presentation was aligned with our management structure and the financial information management uses to make decisions about operating matters, such as the allocation of resources and business performance assessments. prior periods have been recast to conform to the current period presentation.
during 2022, we exited our operations in russia and removed all of our channels and services from the market. we do not expect these actions to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
for further discussion of financial information for our segments and the geographical areas in which we do business, our content development activities, and revenues, see our business overview set forth in item 1, "business" and note 23 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.
we continue to closely monitor the ongoing impact of covid-19 on all aspects of our business and geographies; however, the nature and full extent of covid-19's effects on our operations and results are not yet known and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. certain key sources of revenue for the studios segment, including theatrical revenues, original television productions, studio operations, and themed entertainment, have been adversely impacted by governmentally imposed shutdowns and related labor interruptions and constraints on consumer activity, particularly in the context of public entertainment venues, such as cinemas and theme parks.
results of operations the discussion below compares our actual and pro forma combined results, as if the merger occurred on january 1, 2021, for the year ended december 31, 2022 to the year ended december 31, 2021. management believes reviewing our combined operating results in addition to actual operating results is useful in identifying trends in, or reaching conclusions regarding, the overall operating performance of our businesses. our studios, networks, dtc, corporate, and inter-segment eliminations information is based on the historical operating results of the respective segments and include, where applicable, adjustments for (i) additional costs of revenues from the fair value step-up of film and television library, (ii) additional amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, (iii) additional depreciation expense from the fair value of property and equipment, (iv) transaction costs and other one-time non-recurring costs, (v) additional interest expense for borrowings related to the merger and amortization associated with fair value adjustments of debt assumed, (vi) changes to align accounting policies, (vii) elimination of intercompany activity, and (viii) associated tax-related impacts of adjustments.
adjustments do not include costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of what our results would have been had we operated the combined businesses since january 1, 2021 and should not be taken as indicative of the company's future consolidated results of operations.
actual amounts for the year ended december 31, 2022 include results of operations for discovery for the entire period and wm for the period subsequent to the completion of the merger on april 8, 2022.
foreign exchange impacting comparability in addition to the merger, the impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons of our results. for example, our international revenues are favorably impacted as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the u.s. dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis ("ex-fx"), in addition to results reported in accordance with u.s. gaap provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation ex-fx excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results. the presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, measures of financial performance reported in accordance with u.s. gaap.
the ex-fx change represents the percentage change on a period-over-period basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts. the ex-fx change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate, which is a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process (the "2022 baseline rate"), and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2022 baseline rate. in addition, consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment, our ex-fx results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities, as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
our consolidated results of operations for 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions).

nm - not meaningful unless otherwise indicated, the discussion through operating (loss) income below is on a pro-forma combined basis, ex-fx, since the actual increases year over year for revenues, cost of revenues, and selling, general and administrative expenses are substantially attributable to the merger. the percent changes of line items below operating (loss) income in the table above are not included as the activity is principally in u.s. dollars.
revenues advertising revenues are principally generated from the sale of commercial time on linear (television networks and authenticated tve applications) and digital platforms (dtc subscription services and websites), and sold primarily on a national basis in the u.s. and on a pan-regional or local-language feed basis outside the u.s. advertising contracts generally have a term of one year or less. advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content, our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels, the stage of development of television markets, and the popularity of fta television. revenue from advertising is subject to seasonality, market-based variations, the mix in sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets, and general economic conditions. advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth quarters. in some cases, advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved. we also generate revenue from the sale of advertising through our digital platforms on a stand-alone basis and as part of advertising packages with our television networks.
advertising revenue decreased 4% in 2022, primarily attributable to declines in domestic general entertainment and news networks, partially offset by subscriber growth on our dtc ad-supported tiers and higher sports advertising in the u.s. due to the ncaa men's final four and championship games airing on our networks and the addition of the nhl starting in the fourth quarter of 2021.
distribution revenues are generated from fees charged to network distributors, which include cable, dth satellite, telecommunications and digital service providers, and dtc subscribers. the largest component of distribution revenue is comprised of linear distribution rights to our networks from cable, dth satellite and telecommunication service providers. we have contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite service providers around the world, including the largest operators in the u.s. and major international distributors. distribution revenues are largely dependent on the rates negotiated in the agreements, the number of subscribers that receive our networks, the number of platforms covered in the distribution agreement, and the market demand for the content that we provide. from time to time, renewals of multi-year carriage agreements include significant year one market adjustments to re-set subscriber rates, which then increase at rates lower than the initial increase in the following years. in some cases, we have provided distributors launch incentives, in the form of cash payments or free periods, to carry our networks.
distribution revenue was flat in 2022, primarily attributable to a decline in linear subscribers in the u.s. and lower contractual affiliate rates in some european markets, as well as a decline in wholesale revenues primarily due to the expiration of hbo max on amazon channels in september 2021, offset by global retail subscriber gains on dtc platforms. hbo max re-launched on amazon channels in december 2022.
content revenues are generated from the release of feature films for initial exhibition in theaters, the licensing of feature films and television programs to various television, svod and other digital markets, distribution of feature films and television programs in the physical and digital home entertainment market, sales of console games and mobile in-game content, sublicensing of sports rights, and licensing of intellectual property such as characters and brands.
other revenue increased 36% in 2022, primarily attributable to a full year of results for the warner bros. studio tour london and hollywood, as well as the harry potter flagship store in new york, which opened in june 2021, and services provided to the unconsolidated bt sport joint venture.
costs of revenues our principal component of costs of revenues is content expense. content expense includes television/digital series, specials, films, and sporting events. the costs of producing a content asset and bringing that asset to market consist of production costs, participation costs, and exploitation costs.
costs of revenues increased 1% in 2022, primarily attributable to increased programming expenses on dtc platforms, higher theatrical product content expense, higher sports-related expense globally, and increased expense at cnn, partially offset by lower television product content expense and distribution fees.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs, marketing costs, research costs, occupancy, and back office support fees.
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 10% in 2022, primarily attributable to lower marketing expenses.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. depreciation and amortization decreased 13% in 2022, primarily attributable to a change in amortization method from the straight-line method to the sum of the months' digits method for some of the wm assets acquired.
restructuring in connection with the merger, the company has announced and taken actions to implement projects to achieve cost synergies for the company. restructuring was $3,694 million and $121 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. restructuring in 2022 primarily related to strategic content programming assessments, organization restructuring, facility consolidation activities, and other contract termination costs. (see note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
impairment and loss (gain) on dispositions and disposals groups impairment and loss (gain) on disposition and disposal groups was a $117 million and $152 million loss in 2022 and 2021, respectively. the loss in 2022 was primarily attributable to the write-down to the estimated fair value, less costs to sell, of the ranch lot and knoxville office building and land in connection with the classification as assets held for sale. (see note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) the gain in 2021 was primarily attributable to the sale of our great american country network, partially offset by the wm sale of hello sunshine. (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
interest expense, net actual interest expense, net increased $1,144 million in 2022, primarily attributable to debt assumed as a result of the merger. (see note 11 and note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
loss from equity investees, net actual losses from our equity method investees were $160 million and $18 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. the changes are attributable to the company's share of earnings and losses from its equity investees. (see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

income tax (benefit) expense was $(1,663) million and $236 million, and the company's effective tax rate was 19% and 16% for 2022 and 2021, respectively. the decrease in the tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2022, was primarily attributable to a decrease in pre-tax book income, partially offset by an unfavorable tax adjustment related to the 2022 preferred stock conversion transaction expense that was not deductible for tax purposes (see note 3), as well as the effect of foreign operations, including taxation and allocation of income and losses across multiple foreign jurisdictions. the decrease for the year ended december 31, 2022 was further offset by a deferred tax benefit of $155 million recorded in 2021 resulting from the uk finance act 2021 enacted in june 2021.
the company evaluates the operating performance of its operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and adjusted ebitda. adjusted ebitda is defined as operating income excluding:
•restructuring and facility consolidation;
•gains and losses on business and asset dispositions;
•third-party transaction and integration costs;
•amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content;
•amortization of capitalized interest for content; and
•other items impacting comparability.
the company uses this measure to assess the operating results and performance of its segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance, and allocate resources to each segment. the company believes adjusted ebitda is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. the company excludes employee share-based compensation, restructuring, certain impairment charges, gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and transaction and integration costs from the calculation of adjusted ebitda due to their impact on comparability between periods. the company also excludes the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets, amortization of purchase accounting fair value step-up for content, and amortization of capitalized interest for content, as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. certain corporate expenses and inter-segment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives. adjusted ebitda should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, operating income, net income, and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with u.s. gaap.

(a) prior year actual results have been recast to conform to the current period presentation as a result of the merger and segment recast.
the discussion below is on a pro forma combined basis, ex-fx, since the actual increases year over year for revenues, cost of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses and adjusted ebitda are substantially attributable to the merger.
revenues content revenue decreased 7% in 2022, primarily attributable to lower tv licensing and home entertainment revenue, partially offset by higher theatrical film rental revenue. tv licensing revenue decreased mainly due to large television licensing deals in the prior year and the timing of initial telecast revenue, as the prior year benefited from the ramp up of tv production following covid-related delays in 2020. home entertainment revenue was lower due to strong covid-induced demand in the prior year and fewer new releases of theatrical products. theatrical film rental revenue was favorably impacted by improved performance of our theatrical slate and improved audience attendance at movie theaters.
other revenue increased 36% in 2022, primarily attributable to a full year of results for the warner bros. studio tour london and hollywood, as well as the harry potter flagship store in new york, which opened in june 2021.
costs of revenues costs of revenues decreased 7% in 2022, primarily attributable to lower television product content expense and distribution fees related to the aforementioned television licensing deals, partially offset by higher theatrical product content expense.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 13% in 2022, primarily attributable to lower marketing expense due to fewer theatrical releases in 2022.

revenues advertising revenue decreased 5% in 2022, primarily attributable to declines in domestic general entertainment and news networks, partially offset by higher sports advertising in the u.s. due to the ncaa men's final four and championship games airing on our networks and the addition of the nhl starting in the fourth quarter of 2021.
distribution revenue decreased 1% in 2022, primarily attributable to a decline in linear subscribers in the u.s. and lower contractual affiliate rates in some european markets, partially offset by an increase in contractual affiliate rates in the u.s. and certain latin american markets and premium sports packages in latin america.
content revenue increased by 7% in 2022, primarily attributable to higher inter-segment licensing of content to dtc, partially offset by overall net lower sub-licensing revenue for the winter olympics in 2022 compared to the summer olympics in 2021.
costs of revenues costs of revenues increased 4% in 2022, primarily attributable to higher sports-related expense globally, increased expense at cnn, and costs associated with providing services to the unconsolidated bt sport joint venture, partially offset by lower content expense due to the previously announced restructuring program and lower international sports rights driven by the winter olympics in 2022 (as compared to the summer olympics in 2021).

adjusted ebitda decreased 17% for 2022, primarily attributable to increased securitization costs from higher interest rates, partially offset by lower personnel costs.
as reported transaction and integration costs for 2022 included the impact of the issuance of additional shares of wbd common stock to advance/newhouse programming partnership of $789 million upon the closing of the merger. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

inter-segment revenue and expense eliminations primarily represent inter-segment content transactions and marketing and promotion activity between reportable segments. in our current segment structure, in certain instances, production and distribution activities are in different segments. inter-segment content transactions are presented "gross" (i.e. the segment producing and/or licensing the content reports revenue and profit from inter-segment transactions in a manner similar to the reporting of third-party transactions, and the required eliminations are reported on the separate "eliminations" line when presenting our summary of segment results). generally, timing of revenue recognition is similar to the reporting of third-party transactions. the segment distributing the content, e.g. via our dtc or linear services, capitalizes the cost of inter-segment content transactions, including "mark-ups" and amortizes the costs over the shorter of the license term, if applicable, or the expected period of use. the content amortization expense related to the inter-segment profit is also eliminated on the separate "eliminations" line when presenting our summary of segment results.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity sources of cash historically, we have generated a significant amount of cash from operations. during 2022, we funded our working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations. as of december 31, 2022, we had $3.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. we are a well-known seasoned issuer and have the ability to conduct registered offerings of securities, including debt securities, common stock and preferred stock, on short notice, subject to market conditions. access to sufficient capital from the public market is not assured. we have a $6.0 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper program described below. we also participate in a revolving receivables program and an accounts receivable factoring program described below.
•debt revolving credit facility and commercial paper in june 2021, discovery communication, llc ("dcl") entered into a multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the "revolving credit agreement"), replacing the existing $2.5 billion credit agreement, dated february 4, 2016, as amended, among dcl, the company, certain lenders from time to time party thereto, and bank of america, n.a., as administrative agent. dcl has the capacity to borrow up to $6.0 billion under the revolving credit agreement (the "credit facility"). the revolving credit agreement includes a $150 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit. dcl may also request additional commitments up to $1.0 billion from the lenders upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. obligations under the revolving credit agreement are unsecured and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the company, scripps networks, and warnermedia holdings, inc. the credit facility will be available on a revolving basis until june 2026, with an option for up to two additional 364-day renewal periods subject to the lenders' consent. the revolving credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative covenants. as of december 31, 2022, dcl was in compliance with all covenants and there were no events of default under the revolving credit agreement.
additionally, the company's commercial paper program is supported by the credit facility. under the commercial paper program, the company may issue up to $1.5 billion, including up to $500 million of euro-denominated borrowings. borrowing capacity under the credit facility is reduced by any outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program.
as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, the company had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility or the commercial paper program.
•revolving receivables program the company has a revolving agreement to transfer up to $5.7 billion of certain receivables through its bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, warner bros. discovery receivables funding, llc, to various financial institutions on a recurring basis in exchange for cash equal to the gross receivables transferred. the company services the sold receivables for the financial institution for a fee and pays fees to the financial institution in connection with this revolving agreement. as customers pay their balances, the company's available capacity under this revolving agreement increases and typically the company transfers additional receivables into the program. in some cases, the company may have collections that have not yet been remitted to the bank, resulting in a liability. the outstanding portfolio of receivables derecognized from our consolidated balance sheets was $5,366 million as of december 31, 2022.
•accounts receivable factoring the company has a factoring agreement to sell certain of its non-u.s. trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to a third-party financial institution. total trade accounts receivable sold under the company's factoring arrangements was $477 million as of december 31, 2022.
•derivatives we received investing proceeds of $752 million during the year ended december 31, 2022 from the unwind and settlement of derivative instruments. (see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
•investments and business combinations in addition to other investments, we completed the sale of our minority interests in discovery education and golden maple limited (known as tencent video vip) and received cash of $306 million during the year ended december 31, 2022.
additionally, we acquired $3.6 billion of cash in connection with the merger and the post-closing working capital settlement process.
uses of cash our primary uses of cash include the creation and acquisition of new content, business acquisitions, income taxes, personnel costs, costs to develop and market hbo max and discovery+, principal and interest payments on our outstanding senior notes, funding for various equity method and other investments, and repurchases of our capital stock.
•content acquisition we plan to continue to invest significantly in the creation and acquisition of new content, as well as certain sports rights. subsequent to the merger, our contractual commitments to acquire content have increased significantly. additional information regarding contractual commitments to acquire content is set forth in "material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations" in item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
senior notes during the year ended december 31, 2022, we repaid in full at maturity $327 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 2.375% euro denominated senior notes due march 2022 and issued notices for the redemption in full of all $192 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 3.250% senior notes due in 2023 and all $796 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 2.950% senior notes due 2023 (collectively the "2023 notes"). the 2023 notes were redeemed in december 2022 for an aggregate redemption price of $988 million, plus accrued interest. during 2022, we also assumed $41.5 billion of senior notes (at par value) and term loans in connection with the merger.
in addition, we have $363 million of senior notes coming due in 2023.
•capital expenditures and investments in next generation initiatives we effected capital expenditures of $987 million in 2022, including amounts capitalized to support our next generation platforms, such as hbo max and discovery+. in addition, we expect to continue to incur significant costs to develop and market our combined streaming service in the future.
•investments and business combinations our uses of cash have included investments in equity method investments and equity investments without readily determinable fair value. (see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) we provide funding to our investees from time to time. we contributed $168 million and $184 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, for investments in and advances to our investees.
we have and expect to continue to incur significant, one-time transaction and integration costs during the first year following the merger. (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
•redeemable noncontrolling interest and noncontrolling interest due to business combinations, we also had redeemable equity balances of $318 million at december 31, 2022 which may require the use of cash in the event holders of noncontrolling interests put their interests to us. in 2022, goldentree exercised its put right and we are required to purchase goldentree's noncontrolling interest. (see note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) distributions to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests totaled $300 million and $251 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
•common stock repurchases historically, we have funded our stock repurchases through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and the issuance of debt. in february 2020, our board of directors authorized additional stock repurchases of up to $2 billion upon completion of our existing $1 billion authorization announced in may 2019. under the new stock repurchase authorization, management is authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases at prevailing prices or privately negotiated purchases subject to market conditions and other factors. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) there were no common stock repurchases during 2022 or 2021.
•income taxes and interest we expect to continue to make payments for income taxes and interest on our outstanding senior notes. during 2022 and 2021, we made cash payments of $1,027 million and $643 million for income taxes and $1,539 million and $664 million for interest on our outstanding debt, respectively. cash required for interest payments has increased significantly as a result of the merger.
cash flows the following table presents changes in cash and cash equivalents (in millions).
cash provided by operating activities                                                               4,304                           2,798
cash provided by (used in) investing activities                                                     3,524                            (56)
cash used in financing activities                                                                 (7,742)                           (853)
effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash                       (61)                           (106)
net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash                                              25                           1,783
operating activities cash provided by operating activities was $4,304 million and $2,798 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net income, excluding non-cash items, and working capital initiatives, partially offset by other negative fluctuations in working capital activity.
investing activities cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $3,524 million and $(56) million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. the increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds received from cash acquired during the merger and the post-closing working capital settlement process and cash received from the unwind and settlement of derivative instruments, partially offset by increased purchases of property and equipment and a reduction in cash received from the sales and maturities of investments during the year ended december 31, 2022.
financing activities cash used in financing activities was $7,742 million and $853 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to principal repayments made on our term loans during the year ended december 31, 2022.
capital resources as of december 31, 2022, capital resources were comprised of the following (in millions).
total                                                                                                                                     outstanding           unused capacity                                                                                                                                    indebtedness         capacity cash and cash equivalents                                                                                         $3,731                                                                                                                                              $-                  $3,731
revolving credit facility and commercial paper program                                                             6,000                                                                                                                                               -                   6,000
we expect that our cash balance, cash generated from operations and availability under the credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for both the short-term and the long-term. our borrowing costs and access to capital markets can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in part, on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios.
as of december 31, 2022, we held $3.1 billion of our $3.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents in our foreign subsidiaries. the 2017 tax act features a participation exemption regime with current taxation of certain foreign income and imposes a mandatory repatriation toll tax on unremitted foreign earnings. notwithstanding the u.s. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue to reinvest these funds outside of the u.s. our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to the u.s. however, if these funds were to be needed in the u.s., we would be required to accrue and pay non-u.s. taxes to repatriate them. the determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to these undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable.
material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of december 31, 2022, our significant contractual and other obligations were as follows (in millions).
long-term debt principal payments on long-term debt reflect the repayment of our outstanding senior notes, at face value, assuming repayment will occur upon maturity. interest payments on our outstanding senior notes are projected based on their contractual interest rates and maturity dates.
additionally, dcl's revolving credit facility allows dcl and certain designated foreign subsidiaries of dcl to borrow up to $6.0 billion, including a $150 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit. dcl may also request additional commitments up to $1.0 billion from the lenders upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. additionally, the company's commercial paper program is supported by the credit facility. under the commercial paper program, the company may issue up to $1.5 billion, including up to $500 million of euro-denominated borrowings. borrowing capacity under the credit facility is effectively reduced by any outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility or the commercial paper program. (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
purchase obligations content purchase obligations include commitments and liabilities associated with third-party producers and sports associations for content that airs on our television networks and dtc services. production and licensing contracts generally require: purchase of a specified number of episodes; payments during production or over the term of a license; and include both programs that have been delivered and are available for airing and programs that have not yet been produced or sporting events that have not yet taken place. if the content is ultimately never produced, our commitments expire without obligation. the commitments exclude content liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheet. we expect to enter into additional production contracts and content licenses to meet our future content needs.
other purchase obligations include agreements with certain vendors and suppliers for the purchase of goods and services whereby the underlying agreements are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms. significant purchase obligations include transmission services, television rating services, marketing commitments and research, equipment purchases, and information technology and other services. some of these contracts do not require the purchase of fixed or minimum quantities and generally may be terminated with a 30-day to 60-day advance notice without penalty, and are not included in the table above past the 30-day to 60-day advance notice period.
finance lease obligations we acquire satellite transponders and other equipment through multi-year finance lease arrangements. principal payments on finance lease obligations reflect amounts due under our finance lease agreements. interest payments on our outstanding finance lease obligations are based on the stated or implied rate in our finance lease agreements. (see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
operating lease obligations we obtain office space and equipment under multi-year lease arrangements. most operating leases are not cancelable prior to their expiration. payments for operating leases represent the amounts due under the agreements assuming the agreements are not canceled prior to their expiration. (see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
pension and other employee obligations we sponsor a qualified defined benefit pension plan ("pension plan") that covers certain u.s.-based employees. we also have a non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan ("serp"). in connection with the merger, the company assumed four u.s. nonqualified pension plans that are noncontributory and unfunded and several non-u.s. pension plans (see note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
contractual commitments include payments to meet minimum funding requirements of our pension plan in 2023 and estimated benefit payments for our serp that exceed plan assets. payments for the serp have been estimated over a ten-year period. while benefit payments under these plans are expected to continue beyond 2031, we believe it is not practicable to estimate payments beyond this period.
we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount of any payments due to cash-settled share-based compensation awards. as of december 31, 2022, the current portion of the liability for cash-settled share-based compensation awards was $4 million.
unrecognized tax benefits we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our unrecognized tax benefits because, until formal resolutions are reached, reasonable estimates of the amount and timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable. our unrecognized tax benefits totaled $1,929 million as of december 31, 2022.
six flags guarantee in connection with wm's former investment in the six flags (as defined below) theme parks located in georgia and texas (collectively, the "parks"), in 1997, certain subsidiaries of the company agreed to guarantee (the "six flags guarantee") certain obligations of the partnerships that hold the parks (the "partnerships") for the benefit of the limited partners in such partnerships, including, annual payments made to the parks or to the limited partners and additional obligations at the end of the respective terms for the partnerships in 2027 and 2028 (the "guaranteed obligations"). the aggregate gross undiscounted estimated future cash flow requirements covered by the six flags guarantee over the remaining term (through 2028) are $544 million. to date, no payments have been made by us pursuant to the six flags guarantee.
six flags entertainment corporation (formerly known as six flags, inc. and premier parks inc.) ("six flags"), which has the controlling interest in the parks, has agreed, pursuant to a subordinated indemnity agreement (the "subordinated indemnity agreement"), to guarantee the performance of the guaranteed obligations when due and to indemnify the company, among others, if the six flags guarantee is called upon. if six flags defaults on its indemnification obligations, we have the right to acquire control of the managing partner of the parks. six flags' obligations to us are further secured by its interest in all limited partnership units held by six flags.
based on our evaluation of the current facts and circumstances surrounding the guaranteed obligations and the subordinated indemnity agreement, we are unable to predict the loss, if any, that may be incurred under the guaranteed obligations, and no liability for the arrangements has been recognized as of december 31, 2022. because of the specific circumstances surrounding the arrangements and the fact that no active or observable market exists for this type of financial guarantee, we are unable to determine a current fair value for the guaranteed obligations and related subordinated indemnity agreement.
other contingent commitments other contingent commitments primarily include contingent payments for post-production term advance obligations on certain co-financing arrangements, as well as operating lease commitment guarantees, letters of credit, bank guarantees, and surety bonds, which generally support performance and payments for a wide range of global contingent and firm obligations, including insurance, litigation appeals, real estate leases, and other operational needs.
the company's other contingent commitments at december 31, 2022 were $283 million, with $279 million estimated to be due in 2026. for other contingent commitments where payment obligations are outside our control, the timing of amounts represents the earliest period in which the payment could be requested. for the remaining other contingent commitments, the timing of the amounts presented represents when the maximum contingent commitment will expire but does not mean that we expect to incur an obligation to make any payments within that time period. in addition, these amounts do not reflect the effects of any indemnification rights we might possess.
put rights we have granted put rights to certain consolidated subsidiaries, but we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of any payment. we recorded the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest in the equity associated with the put rights as a component of redeemable noncontrolling interest in the amount of $318 million. (see note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
noncontrolling interest the food network and cooking channel are operated and organized under the terms of the tv food network partnership (the "partnership"). we hold interests in the partnership, along with another noncontrolling owner. the partnership agreement specifies a dissolution date of december 31, 2023. if the term of the partnership is not extended prior to that date, the partnership agreement permits us, as holder of 80% of the applicable votes, to reconstitute the partnership and continue its business. if for some reason the partnership is not continued, it will be required to limit its activities to winding up, settling debts, liquidating assets and distributing proceeds to the partners in proportion to their partnership interests.
summarized guarantor financial information basis of presentation as of december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, all of the company's outstanding $13.8 billion registered senior notes have been issued by dcl, a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, and guaranteed by the company, scripps networks, and warnermedia holdings, inc. as of december 31, 2022, the company also has outstanding $30.0 billion of senior notes issued by warnermedia holdings, inc. and guaranteed by the company, scripps and dcl; $1.5 billion of senior notes issued by the legacy warnermedia business (not guaranteed); and approximately $23 million of un-exchanged senior notes issued by scripps networks (not guaranteed). (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) dcl primarily includes the discovery channel and tlc networks in the u.s. dcl is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company. scripps networks is also wholly owned by the company.
the tables below present the summarized financial information as combined for warner bros. discovery, inc. (the "parent"), scripps networks, dcl, and warnermedia holdings, inc. (collectively, the "obligors"). all guarantees of dcl and warnermedia holdings, inc.'s senior notes (the "note guarantees") are full and unconditional, joint and several and unsecured, and cover all payment obligations arising under the senior notes.
note guarantees issued by scripps networks, dcl or warnermedia holdings, inc., or any subsidiary of the parent that in the future issues a note guarantee (each, a "subsidiary guarantor") may be released and discharged (i) concurrently with any direct or indirect sale or disposition of such subsidiary guarantor or any interest therein, (ii) at any time that such subsidiary guarantor is released from all of its obligations under its guarantee of payment, (iii) upon the merger or consolidation of any subsidiary guarantor with and into dcl, warnermedia holdings, inc. or the parent or another subsidiary guarantor, as applicable, or upon the liquidation of such subsidiary guarantor and (iv) other customary events constituting a discharge of the obligors' obligations.
summarized financial information the company has included the accompanying summarized combined financial information of the obligors after the elimination of intercompany transactions and balances among the obligors and the elimination of equity in earnings from and investments in any subsidiary of the parent that is a non-guarantor (in millions). the summarized balance sheet information as of december 31, 2022 does not include information with respect to warnermedia holdings, inc., as warnermedia holdings, inc. was a wholly-owned subsidiary of at&t with de minimis assets and no operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2022. the summarized income statement information for the year ended december 31, 2022 includes information with respect to warnermedia holdings, inc. beginning subsequent to the close of the merger.

related party transactions in the ordinary course of business, we enter into transactions with related parties, primarily the liberty entities and our equity method investees. information regarding transactions and amounts with related parties is discussed in note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.
new accounting and reporting pronouncements we adopted certain accounting and reporting standards during 2022. information regarding our adoption of new accounting and reporting standards is discussed in note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to uncertain tax positions, goodwill and intangible assets, content rights, consolidation and revenue recognition. we base our estimates on historical experience, current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources. there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations.
the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates have been determined by management and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company. we believe the following accounting estimates are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
uncertain tax positions we are subject to income taxes in numerous u.s. and foreign jurisdictions. from time to time, we engage in transactions or take filing positions in which the tax consequences may be uncertain and may recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. we establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless we determine that such positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on their technical merits, including the resolution of any appeals or litigation processes. we include interest and where appropriate, potential penalties, as a component of income tax expense on the consolidated statement of operations. this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events including the status and results of income tax audits with the relevant tax authorities. significant judgment is exercised in evaluating all relevant information, the technical merits of the tax positions, and the accurate measurement of uncertain tax positions when determining the amount of reserve and whether positions taken on our tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained. this also involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the potential outcome of positions taken on tax returns that may be reviewed by tax authorities. at december 31, 2022, the reserve for uncertain tax positions was $1,929 million, and it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to certain of our uncertain tax positions could decrease by as much as $316 million within the next twelve months as a result of ongoing audits, foreign judicial proceedings, lapses of statutes of limitations or regulatory developments.
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is allocated to our reporting units, which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments (the component level). reporting units are determined by the discrete financial information available for the component and whether it is regularly reviewed by segment management. components are aggregated into a single reporting unit if they share similar economic characteristics. our reporting units are studios, networks, and dtc.
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 or earlier upon the occurrence of substantive unfavorable changes in economic conditions, industry trends, costs, cash flows, or ongoing declines in market capitalization. if we believe that as a result of our qualitative assessment it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is required. the quantitative impairment test requires significant judgment in determining the fair value of the reporting units. we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow ("dcf") method and the market multiple approach, which incorporates the use of ebitda multiples based on market data. for the dcf method, we use projections specific to the reporting unit, as well as those based on general economic conditions, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions. determining fair value specific to each reporting unit requires us to exercise judgment when selecting the appropriate discount rates, control premiums, terminal growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, including revenue growth rates and profit margins. the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis for each reporting unit are based on the reporting unit's budget, long range plan, and recent operating performance. discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and market conditions.
2022 impairment analysis as of october 1, 2022, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units consistent with our accounting policy. the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by at least 20% and, therefore, no impairment was recorded. due to declining levels of global gdp growth and execution risk associated with anticipated growth in the company's dtc reporting unit, which is the dtc segment, the company will continue to monitor its reporting units for changes that could impact recoverability.
content rights we capitalize the costs to produce or acquire feature films and television programs, and we amortize costs and test for impairment based on whether the content is predominately monetized individually, or as a group.
for films and television programs predominantly monetized individually, the amount of capitalized film and television production costs amortized and the amount of participations and residuals to be recognized as expense in a particular period are determined using the individual film forecast method. under this method, the amortization of capitalized costs and the accrual of participations and residuals are based on the proportion of the film's or television program's revenues recognized for such period to the film's or television program's estimated remaining ultimate revenues (i.e., the total revenue to be received throughout a film's or television program's remaining life cycle).
for theatrical films, which are monetized on an individual basis, the process of estimating ultimate revenues requires us to make a series of judgments related to future revenue-generating activities associated with a particular film. prior to the theatrical release of a film, our estimates are based on factors such as the historical performance of similar films, the star power of the lead actors, the rating and genre of the film, pre-release market research (including test market screenings), international distribution plans and the expected number of theaters in which the film will be released. subsequent to release, ultimate revenues are updated to reflect initial performance, which is often predictive of future performance.
for television programs that are monetized on an individual basis, ultimate revenues are estimated based on factors including the performance of similar programs in each applicable market, firm commitments in hand from customers that license the program in the future, and the popularity of the program in its initial markets.
for a film or television program that is predominantly monetized on its own but also monetized with other films and/or programs (such as our dtc or linear services), we make a reasonable estimate of the value attributable to the film or program's exploitation while monetized with other films/programs, based on relative market rates, and expense such costs as the film or television program is exhibited.
ultimates for content monetized on an individual basis are reviewed and updated (as applicable) on a quarterly basis; any adjustments are applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year of the change.
for programs monetized as a group, including licensed programming, amortization expense for network programs is generally based on projected usage, generally resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern. adjustments to projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change. streaming and premium pay-tv content amortization is based on estimated viewing patterns, as there are generally limited to no direct revenues to associate to the individual content assets for premium pay-tv. as such, number of views is most representative of the use of the title.
judgment is required to determine the useful lives and amortization patterns of our content assets that are predominately monetized as a group. critical assumptions include: (i) the grouping of content with similar characteristics, (ii) the application of a quantitative revenue forecast model or historical viewership model based on the adequacy of historical data, (iii) determining the appropriate historical periods to utilize and the relative weighting of those historical periods in the forecast model, and (iv) incorporating secondary revenue streams. we then consider the appropriate application of the quantitative assessment given forecasted content use, expected content investment and market trends. content use and future revenues may differ from estimates based on changes in expectations related to market acceptance, network affiliate fee rates, advertising demand, the number of cable and satellite television subscribers receiving our networks, the number of subscribers to our streaming services, and program usage. accordingly, we review our estimates and planned usage at least quarterly and revise our assumptions if necessary.
consolidation we have ownership and other interests in and contractual arrangements with various entities, including corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies. for each such entity, we evaluate our ownership, other interests and contractual arrangements to determine whether we should consolidate the entity or account for its interest as an investment at inception and upon reconsideration events. as part of its evaluation, we initially determine whether the entity is a variable interest entity ("vie"). management evaluates key considerations through a qualitative and quantitative analysis in determining whether an entity is a vie including whether (i) the entity has sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties, (ii) the ability or inability to make significant decisions about the entity's operations, and (iii) the proportionality of voting rights of investors relative to their obligations to absorb the expected losses (or receive the expected returns) of the entity. if the entity is a vie and if we have a variable interest in the entity, we use judgment in determining if we are the primary beneficiary and are thus required to consolidate the entity. in making this determination, we evaluate whether we or another party involved with the vie (1) has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses of or receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie.
if it is concluded that an entity is not a vie, we consider our proportional voting interests in the entity and consolidate majority-owned subsidiaries in which a controlling financial interest is maintained. a controlling financial interest is determined by majority ownership and the absence of substantive third-party participation rights. key factors we consider in determining the presence of substantive third-party participation rights include, but are not limited to, control of the board of directors, budget approval or veto rights, or operational rights that significantly impact the economic performance of the business such as programming, creative development, marketing, and selection of key personnel. ownership interests in unconsolidated entities for which we have significant influence are accounted for as equity method.
we evaluated reconsideration events during the year ended december 31, 2022 and concluded there were no changes to our consolidation assessments.
revenue recognition as described in note 2, revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services or goods to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services or goods. significant estimates and judgements are applied in determining the timing of revenue recognition for certain types of transactions, such as bundled arrangements for advertising sales and content licensing arrangements.
a substantial portion of the advertising contracts in the u.s. and certain international markets guarantee the advertiser a minimum audience level that either the program in which their advertisements are aired or the advertisement will reach. these advertising campaigns are considered to represent a single, distinct performance obligation. for such contracts, judgment is required in measuring progress across our single performance obligation. various factors such as pricing specific to the channel, daypart and targeted demographic, as well as audience guarantees, are considered in determining how to appropriately measure progress across the campaigns. revenues are ultimately recognized based on the guaranteed audience level delivered multiplied by the average price per impression.
our content licensing arrangements often include fixed license fees from the licensing of feature films and television programs in the off-network cable, premium pay, syndication, streaming, and international television and streaming markets. for arrangements that include multiple titles and/or staggered availabilities across geographical regions, the availability of each title and/or each region is considered a separate performance obligation, and the fixed fee is allocated to each title/region based on comparable market rates and recognized as revenue when the title is available for use by the licensee.
our games sometimes include digital offerings such as in-game purchases or other online features. in these cases, we determine the timing of satisfaction of our performance obligations based on the nature of the deliverable (e.g., whether the type of in-game purchase can be consumed by the player right away ("consumable good", or used by the player over time "durable good")), and if recognized over time, we estimate the duration of consumer game play based on available game play, historical, or market data.

business overview ametek's operations are affected by global, regional and industry-specific economic factors. however, the company's strategic geographic and industry diversification, and its mix of products and services, have helped to mitigate the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. in 2022, the company posted record sales, operating income, operating margins, net income, diluted earnings per share, backlog, and orders. the company also benefited from its strategic initiatives under ametek's four key strategies: operational excellence, strategic acquisitions, global & market expansion and new products.

recent events and market conditions recent events and market conditions impacting our business include the inflationary cost environment, rising interest rates, supply chain constraints, the covid-19 pandemic, and the ongoing conflict in ukraine. as a result of these events and conditions, we anticipate the challenging global economic environment to continue into 2023.
beginning in 2021, we experienced heightened levels of inflation in material and transportation costs. we have taken steps to mitigate the impacts of material and transportation cost inflation by implementing pricing actions. we experienced additional pressure in our supply chain due to component shortages and strained transportation capacity, as well as the impact of continued elevated customer demand. in response to these supply chain pressures, we have taken actions to build inventory and seek alternative sources of supply to support sales and backlog growth. the inflationary environment has also resulted in central banks raising short-term interest rates. we expect inflation to continue into 2023 and will continue to take actions to mitigate this inflationary pressure.
there still remains uncertainty concerning the covid-19 pandemic, its effect on labor, government mandated lockdowns and other restrictive measures, and the pandemic's ultimate duration. lockdowns in china during 2022 limited our ability to access customer sites, operate certain facilities, and placed additional constraints on our supply chain. depending on the course of the pandemic, additional lockdowns in china or elsewhere could impact our operations and results of operations.
the invasion of ukraine by russia and the sanctions imposed in response to this conflict have increased global economic and political uncertainty. while we do not have operations in russia or ukraine and do not have significant exposure to customers and vendors in those countries, a significant expansion of the conflict's current scope could further complicate the economic environment.
while the ultimate impact of these events remains uncertain, we will continue to evaluate the extent to which these factors will impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the company's financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based on the company's historical experience and management's judgment. because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ materially from the estimates used. below are the policies used in preparing the company's financial statements that management believes are the most dependent upon the application of estimates and assumptions. a complete list of the company's significant accounting policies is in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
•business combinations. the company allocates the purchase price of an acquired company, including when applicable, the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values, with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. third party appraisal firms and other consultants are engaged to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. estimating fair values requires significant judgments, estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to: discount rates, future cash flows and the economic lives of trade names, technology, and customer relationships. these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.
•goodwill and other intangible assets. goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. the company performs either a qualitative or quantitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units.
when testing goodwill for impairment, the company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if the company performs a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not, then performance of a quantitative impairment test is required. in conducting a qualitative assessment, the company analyzes actual and forecasted net sales and selling profit for each reporting unit, as well as historical performance and the results of prior quantitative tests performed. additionally, the company assesses critical areas that may impact its business, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, or any relevant events and factors that may impact projected financial results.
if performed, the quantitative goodwill impairment test uses a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which considers cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate. the annual goodwill impairment test requires the company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements, which are based on the company's long-range plan and are considered level 3 inputs. the discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. while the company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances.
the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. the company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those assets. the company elected to perform its annual goodwill impairment test using the quantitative analysis method. the company may elect to perform the quantitative analysis in future periods. the company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method using level 3 inputs, which is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net revenues discounted using an appropriate discount rate. each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the trade name to which it relates and observed market royalty rates. certain impairment models have discount rates calculated based on a debt/equity cost of capital. while the company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded intangible balances. while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, the company's overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged.
the company's acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the company expects to continue to make acquisitions. at december 31, 2022, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $6,262.2 million or 50.4% of the company's total assets. the company completed its required annual indefinite-lived intangibles impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2022 and determined that the carrying values of certain of the company's indefinite-lived intangibles were impaired as a result of higher discount rates driven by higher interest rates. as a result, in the fourth quarter of 2022, the company recorded an immaterial non-cash impairment charge related to certain of the company's trade names. the company completed its annual qualitative goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2022 and determined the carrying values of its goodwill intangibles were not impaired. there can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future.
•pensions. the company has u.s. and foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. the most significant elements in determining the company's pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. the pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be settled at the valuation date. at the end of each year, the company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities. in estimating this rate for 2022, the company considered rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments that have maturities consistent with the anticipated funding requirements of the plan. in estimating the u.s. and foreign discount rates, the company's actuaries developed a customized discount rate appropriate to the plans' projected benefit cash flow based on yields derived from a database of long-term bonds at consistent maturity dates. the company determines the expected long-term rate of return based primarily on its expectation of future returns for the pension plans' investments. additionally, the company considers historical returns on comparable fixed-income and equity investments and adjusts its estimate as deemed appropriate.
•income taxes. the process of providing for income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. the company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the company's tax assets and liabilities. to the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to the company's tax assets and liabilities may be necessary.
the company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the company's forecast of future taxable income, available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and the amount of, valuation allowances against the company's deferred tax assets. to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.
the company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions, by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. once the minimum threshold is met, using a more likely than not standard, a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit. the tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination. the underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes, published guidance, external expert opinion, or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past. there can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy, legislation and audit practice. the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.

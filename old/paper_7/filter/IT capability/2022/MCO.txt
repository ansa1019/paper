item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the moody's corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements. see "forward-looking statements" commencing on page 61 and item 1a. "risk factors" commencing on page 23 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements.
mis publishes credit ratings and provides assessment services on a wide range of debt obligations, programs and facilities, and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide, including various corporate, financial institution and governmental obligations, and structured finance securities.
ma is a global provider of: i) data and information; ii) research and insights; and iii) decision solutions, which help companies make better and faster decisions. ma leverages its industry expertise across multiple risks such as credit, market, financial crime, supply chain, catastrophe and climate to deliver integrated risk assessment solutions that enable business leaders to identify, measure and manage the implications of interrelated risks and opportunities.
current matters impacting moody's business current macroeconomic uncertainties/market volatility the company is monitoring current macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties that have contributed to declines in rated issuance volumes in 2022. a substantial portion of mis's revenue is impacted by the level of issuance activity in the fixed income capital markets, both in the u.s. and internationally. while market volatility in 2022 has resulted in declines in rated issuance volumes, the company believes that these declines are predominantly cyclical in nature. however, due to various uncertainties, moody's is unable to predict the severity and duration of current macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties and their potential impact on future ratings issuance volumes. refer to item 1a. "risk factors" for further disclosure relating to these risks.
russia/ukraine conflict the company is closely monitoring the impact of the ongoing russia/ukraine conflict on all aspects of its business. in response to the conflict, the company is no longer conducting commercial operations in russia for both mis and ma and is complying with all applicable regulatory restrictions set forth by the jurisdictions in which moody's operates. furthermore, the company also has withdrawn mis credit ratings on russian entities.
while moody's russian operations and net assets are not material, broader global market volatility, which partially relates to uncertainties surrounding the conflict, has contributed to an adverse impact on rated issuance volumes in 2022. this impact to rated issuance volumes is more fully discussed in the "results of operations" section of this md&a. the company is unable to predict either the near-term or longer-term impact that the conflict may have on its financial position and operating results due to numerous uncertainties regarding the severity and duration of the conflict and its broader potential macroeconomic impact.
the company continues to closely monitor the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on all aspects of its business. the company continues to monitor regional developments relating to the covid-19 pandemic to inform decisions regarding its offices and its business travel policies. as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form 10-k, the company has reopened all of its offices for employees to access.
the covid-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse impact on the company's reported results to date and is currently not expected to have a material adverse impact on its financial outlook. refer to item 1a. "risk factors" for further disclosure relating to the risks of the covid-19 pandemic on the company's business.
critical accounting estimates moody's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires moody's to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. on an ongoing basis, moody's evaluates its critical accounting estimates. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management's judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
table of contents goodwill and other acquired intangible assets at july 31st of each year, moody's evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment (i.e., mis and ma), or one level below an operating segment (i.e., a component of an operating segment).
the company has four reporting units: two within the company's ratings business (one for the icra business and one that encompasses all of moody's other ratings operations) and two reporting units within ma consisting of businesses that offer: i) data and data-driven analytical solutions; and ii) risk-management software, workflow and cre solutions.
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. in the first step, the company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount. if a determination is made based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist, the company is not required to perform further testing. if the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the fair value of the reporting unit will be quantitatively determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill. if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired, and the company is not required to perform further testing. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the company will record a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the company due to acquisitions, realignments or if there are indicators of potential impairment. for the reporting units where the company is consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach, the company's accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years.
the company last performed quantitative assessments on all reporting units at july 31, 2021, pursuant to a change in reporting unit structure in the ma reportable segment. the quantitative assessments performed at july 31, 2021 resulted in fair values that significantly exceeded carrying values for all reporting units.
determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which are more fully described below. in addition, the company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units.
other assets and liabilities, including applicable corporate assets, are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units.
at july 31, 2022, the company performed qualitative assessments for each of the four reporting units. these qualitative assessments resulted in the company determining that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount.
methodologies and significant estimates utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units:
the following is a discussion regarding the company's methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units, excluding icra, at july 31, 2021 (the date of the last quantitative assessment). as icra is a publicly traded company in india, the company was able to observe its fair value based on its market capitalization.
the fair value of each reporting unit, excluding icra, was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples. the discounted cash flow analysis requires significant estimates, including projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit that are based on internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long-term growth rates, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit that could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which could be material to the company's financial position and results of operations. moody's allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition.
the sensitivity analyses on the future cash flows and wacc assumptions are described below. these key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology require significant management judgment:
-future cash flow assumptions - the projections for future cash flows utilized in the models are derived from historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit. these projections are consistent with the company's operating budget and strategic plan. cash flows for the five years subsequent to the date of the quantitative goodwill impairment test were utilized in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the growth rates assumed a gradual increase in revenue based on new customer acquisition and new products. beyond five years, a terminal value was determined using a perpetuity growth rate based on inflation and real gdp growth rates. a sensitivity analysis of the revenue growth rates was performed on all reporting units. for each reporting unit analyzed, a 10% reduction in the revenue growth rates used would still result in fair values that significantly exceeded carrying values.
-wacc - the wacc is the rate used to discount each reporting unit's estimated future cash flows. the wacc is calculated based on the proportionate weighting of the cost of debt and equity. the cost of equity is based on a risk-free interest rate and an equity risk factor, which is derived from public companies similar to the reporting unit and which captures the perceived risks and uncertainties associated with the reporting unit's cash flows. the cost of debt component is calculated as the
36     moody's 2022 10-k table of contents weighted average cost associated with all of the company's outstanding borrowings as of the date of the impairment test and was immaterial to the computation of the wacc. the cost of debt and equity is weighted based on the debt to market capitalization ratio of publicly traded companies with similarities to the reporting unit being tested. the wacc for all reporting units ranged from 8.0% to 8.5% as of july 31, 2021. differences in the wacc used between reporting units is primarily due to distinct risks and uncertainties regarding the cash flows of the different reporting units. a sensitivity analysis of the wacc was performed on all reporting units as of july 31, 2021 for each reporting unit. for all reporting units, an increase in the wacc of one percentage point would still result in fair values that significantly exceeded carrying values.
long-lived assets long-lived assets, which consist primarily of amortizable intangible assets, operating lease rou assets and property and equipment, are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
under the first step of the recoverability assessment, moody's compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or asset group to its carrying value. if the undiscounted future cash flows are greater than the carrying value, no further assessment is required. if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value, moody's proceeds with step two of the assessment. under step two of this assessment, moody's is required to determine the fair value of the asset or asset group and recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. in performing this assessment, moody's must include assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value, including the estimated future cash flows and discount rate. moody's must apply judgment in developing estimated future cash flows and in the determination of market participant assumptions.
income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions. the company's tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions. the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc topic 740. therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes, and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes.
the company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for utps. the company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company's consolidated financial statements and associated penalties, if any, as part of other non-operating expenses.
for utps, asc topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. a tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. as the determination of liabilities related to utps and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company, there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company's operating results or financial condition.
revenue recognition and costs to obtain a contract with a customer revenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
the discussion below outlines areas of the company's revenue recognition process that require significant management judgment and estimates. refer to note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for a comprehensive discussion regarding the company's accounting policies relating to the recognition of revenue and costs to obtain a contract with a customer.
in the mis segment, the ssp for both ratings and monitoring services is generally based upon directly observable selling prices where the rating or monitoring service is sold separately.
table of contents costs to obtain a contract with a customer:
costs incurred to obtain customer contracts, such as sales commissions, are deferred and recorded within other current assets and other assets when such costs are determined to be incremental to obtaining a contract, would not have been incurred otherwise and the company expects to recover those costs. these costs are amortized to expense on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of products or services to the customer for which the asset relates. depending on the line of business to which the contract relates, this amortization period may be based upon the average economic life of the products sold or average period for which services are provided, inclusive of anticipated contract renewals.
contingencies accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. in many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent management's best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may, in the future, adjust its associated liabilities.
for claims, litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes, the company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range. in instances when a loss is reasonably possible but uncertainties exist related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if material. as additional information becomes available, the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. moody's also discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to sec rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate.
in view of the inherent difficulty of assessing the potential outcome of legal proceedings, governmental, regulatory and legislative investigations and inquiries, claims and litigation and similar matters and contingencies, particularly when the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. the company also may be unable to predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. as the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition and to accrue for and disclose such matters as and when required. however, because such matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the ultimate outcome of such matters, including the amount of any loss, may differ from those estimates.
pension and other retirement benefits the expenses, assets and liabilities that moody's reports for its retirement plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. these significant assumptions include the following:
-long-term expected return on pension plan assets based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan's portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed-income investments); and
the discount rates used to measure the present value of the company's benefit obligation for its retirement plans as of december 31, 2022 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares each plan's projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the ftse pension discount curve. the cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan.
moody's major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. in determining these assumptions, the company consults with third-party actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the company's retirement plans.
when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. excluding differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual returns on plan assets, the company amortizes, as a component of annual pension expense, total outstanding actuarial gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gain/loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the beginning-of-year projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. for moody's retirement plans, the total actuarial losses as of december 31, 2022 that have not been recognized in annual expense are $68 million, and moody's expects the net periodic expense related to the amortization of net actuarial (losses)/gains will be immaterial in 2023.
38     moody's 2022 10-k table of contents for moody's funded u.s. pension plan, the differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual returns could also affect the net periodic pension expense. as permitted under asc topic 715, the company amortizes the impact of asset returns over a five-year period for purposes of calculating the market-related value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets' component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization. as of december 31, 2022, the company has an unrecognized loss of $106 million, of which $19 million will be recognized in the market-related value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets component of 2023 expense.
the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage-point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody's 2023 income before provision for income taxes. these effects have been calculated using the company's current projections of 2023 expenses, assets and liabilities related to moody's retirement plans, which could change as updated data becomes available.
investments in non-consolidated affiliates equity method investments are reviewed for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. these investments are written down to fair value if there is evidence of a loss in value that is other-than-temporary.
for equity investments without a readily determinable fair value for which the company does not have significant influence, moody's generally elects to measure these investments at cost, less impairment, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes as of the date that an observable transaction takes place.
the company performs an assessment on a quarterly basis to determine if there are indicators of impairment for its investments in non-consolidated affiliates. if there are indicators of impairment, the company estimates the investment's fair value and records an impairment if the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value.
in situations where estimation of fair value is required for investments in non-consolidated affiliates, the company considers various factors, including: recent observable investee equity transactions, comparable public company/precedent transaction multiples and discounted cash flow models. the estimation of fair value for these investments may involve significant judgment.
other estimates in addition to the critical accounting estimates described above, there are other accounting estimates within moody's consolidated financial statements. management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody's consolidated financial statements are appropriate. however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody's consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
reportable segments the company is organized into two reportable segments at december 31, 2022: mis and ma, which are more fully described in the section entitled "the company" above and in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.

- higher costs of approximately $15 million relating to strategic initiatives to support business growth coupled with enhancements to technology infrastructure to enable automation, innovation and efficiency.
partially offset by: - inorganic growth from acquisitions of approximately $30 million; and
depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is driven by higher amortization of intangible assets reflecting recent m&a activity (most notably rms) coupled with amortization of internally developed software, which is primarily related to the development of ma saas solutions.
- an approximate $45 million benefit in the prior year related to the reversal of tax-related interest accruals pursuant to the resolution of utps; and                                                                                                  - a $36 million non-cash gain in 2021 relating to the exchange of the company's minority investment in visiblerisk for shares of bitsight; and
- $31 million higher interest on borrowings resulting from the issuance of new long-term debt late in 2021 and in 2022 (refer to the "material cash requirements" section of this md&amp;a for further information on the company's indebtedness).       - $20 million in fx translation losses reclassified to earnings in 2022 resulting from the company no longer conducting commercial operations in russia (refer to the section above entitled "russia/ukraine conflict" for further information); partially offset by
- tax benefits realized upon resolution of uncertain tax positions during 2021 that did not recur to the same extent in 2022; and
- a non-deductible loss in 2022 associated with the company no longer conducting commercial operations in russia.
diluted eps and adjusted diluted eps declined mainly due to lower operating income and adjusted operating income, respectively. refer to the section entitled "non-gaap financial measures" of this md&a for items excluded in the derivation of adjusted diluted eps.

mis: global revenue ⇓ $1,113 million         u.s. revenue ⇓ $710 million         non-u.s. revenue ⇓ $403 million the decrease in global mis revenue primarily relates to a 31% decrease in rated issuance volumes, which resulted in transaction revenue declining $1,128 million compared to the same period in the prior year. the decline in rated issuance volumes compared to 2021 reflected muted credit market activity across all sectors given ongoing market volatility, central bank actions, high levels of balance sheet cash, as well as heightened inflationary and recessionary concerns.
(1) other includes: recurring monitoring fees of a rated debt obligation and/or entities that issue such obligations as well as fees from programs such as commercial paper, medium term notes and icra corporate finance revenue.
the most notable drivers of the decrease compared to 2021 reflected declines in leveraged finance and investment-grade issuance activity resulting from muted credit market activity given ongoing market volatility, central bank actions, high levels of balance sheet cash, as well as heightened inflationary and recessionary concerns compared to a strong prior year period.
table of contents the most notable driver of the decline compared to 2021 was a decrease in clo refinancing activity in the u.s. and emea resulting from the widening of credit spreads for this asset class.
-a decline in opportunistic issuance, as banks, insurers and asset management issuers were well capitalized following financing activity in the prior year period ahead of anticipated interest rate increases.
-declines in u.s. public finance revenue resulting from market volatility, which increased funding costs, coupled with issuers in this sector being currently well capitalized; and
-declines in sovereign, project finance and infrastructure finance rated issuance volumes in emea resulting from market volatility and rising funding costs.
- lower incentive compensation accruals and performance-based equity compensation of approximately $165 million, which aligns with actual/projected financial and operating performance.                                                                                                                                      - higher bad debt reserves of approximately $20 million resulting from the impact of the russia/ukraine conflict; and

52     moody's 2022 10-k table of contents ma: operating and sg&amp;a expense ⇑ $142 million the increase in operating and sg&a expenses compared to 2021 is primarily due to growth in both compensation and non-compensation costs of $125 million and $17 million, respectively, with the most notable drivers of the increase reflecting:
- inorganic expense growth from acquisitions of approximately $150 million.         - operating and integration-related costs associated with recent acquisitions of approximately $65 million;partially offset by:
- lower consulting/professional fees of approximately $45 million due in part to a higher proportion of costs capitalized relating to the development of saas-based solutions.

moody's maintains a presence in more than 40 countries. in 2022, approximately 40% of the company's revenue and approximately 38% of the company's expenses were denominated in functional currencies other than the u.s. dollar, principally in the british pound and the euro. as such, the company is exposed to market risk from changes in fx rates. as of december 31, 2022, approximately 51% of moody's assets were located outside the u.s., making the company susceptible to fluctuations in fx rates. the effects of translating assets and liabilities of non-u.s. operations with non-u.s. functional currencies to the u.s. dollar are charged or credited to oci.
the effects of revaluing assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary's functional currency are charged to other non-operating income (expense), net in the company's consolidated statements of operations. accordingly, the company enters into foreign exchange forwards to partially mitigate the change in fair value on certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary's functional currency. the following table shows the impact to the fair value of moody's 2022 10-k     53

(1)refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k for further detail on the forward contracts.
the change in fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would be offset by fx revaluation gains or losses on underlying assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary's functional currency.
cross-currency swaps as of december 31, 2022, the company had cross-currency swaps designated as hedges of euro denominated net investments in subsidiaries, for which the notional values and corresponding interest rates are disclosed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements located in item 8 of this form 10-k.
euro-denominated debt as of december 31, 2022, the company has designated €500 million of the 2015 senior notes and €750 million of the 2019 senior notes as a net investment hedge to mitigate fx exposure relating to euro denominated net investments in subsidiaries. if the euro were to strengthen 10% relative to the u.s. dollar, there would be an approximate $133 million unfavorable adjustment to oci related to these net investment hedges. this adjustment would be offset by favorable translation adjustments on the company's euro net investment in subsidiaries.
interest rate and credit risk:
the company's interest rate risk management objectives are to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to a desired risk profile. moody's uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing these objectives. the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its various outstanding fixed-rate debt for which the fair value of the outstanding fixed rate debt fluctuates based on changes in interest rates. the company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert the fixed interest rate on certain of its long-term debt to a floating interest rate based on the 3-month and 6-month libor as well as sofr. these swaps are adjusted to fair market value based on prevailing interest rates at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded as a reduction or addition to the carrying value of the borrowing, while net interest payments are recorded as interest expense/income in the company's consolidated statement of operations. a hypothetical change of 100 bps in the libor/sofr-based swap rate would result in an approximate $110 million change to the fair value of the swaps, which would be offset by the change in fair value of the hedged item.
additional information on these interest rate swaps is disclosed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements located in item 8 of this form 10-k.
moody's cash equivalents consist of investments in high-quality investment-grade securities within and outside the u.s. with maturities of three months or less when purchased. the company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market deposit accounts and certificates of deposit and by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit.
54     moody's 2022 10-k table of contents liquidity and capital resources moody's remains committed to using its strong cash flow to create value for shareholders by both investing in the company's employees and growing the business through targeted organic initiatives and inorganic acquisitions aligned with strategic priorities. additional excess capital is returned to the company's shareholders via a combination of dividends and share repurchases.

(1)free cash flow is a non-gaap measure and is defined by the company as net cash provided by operating activities minus cash paid for capital expenditures. refer to the section entitled "non-gaap financial measures" of this md&a for further information on this financial measure.
net cash provided by operating activities net cash flows from operating activities decreased $531 million compared to the prior year primarily reflecting:
-a decrease in operating income of $961 million (see section entitled "results of operations" of this md&a for further discussion);
-various changes in working capital;
net cash used in investing activities the $2,357 million decrease in cash flows used in investing activities compared to 2021 primarily reflects:
-higher cash paid of $2,082 million in the prior year for acquisitions, primarily reflecting the acquisition of rms (refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the company's m&a activity);
-$250 million of cash paid in the prior year for a minority investment in bitsight (refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the company's investments in non-consolidated affiliates); and
-an increase in cash paid for capital additions of $144 million reflecting product development and investments relating to strategic initiatives to support business growth and to enhance technology infrastructure to enable automation, innovation and efficiency.
net cash used in financing activities the $1,086 million increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributed to:
table of contents cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments the company's aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.9 billion at december 31, 2022 included approximately $1.4 billion located outside of the u.s. approximately 42% of the company's aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments is denominated in euros and british pounds. the company manages both its u.s. and non-u.s. cash flow to maintain sufficient liquidity in all regions to effectively meet its operating needs.
as a result of the tax act, all previously net undistributed foreign earnings have now been subject to u.s. tax. the company continues to evaluate which entities it will indefinitely reinvest earnings outside the u.s. the company has provided deferred taxes for those entities whose earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested. accordingly, the company has commenced repatriating a portion of its non-u.s. cash in these subsidiaries and will continue to repatriate certain of its offshore cash in a manner that addresses compliance with local statutory requirements, sufficient offshore working capital and any other factors that may be relevant in certain jurisdictions. notwithstanding the tax act, which generally eliminated federal income tax on future cash repatriation to the u.s., cash repatriation may be subject to state and local taxes or withholding or similar taxes.
financing arrangements indebtedness at december 31, 2022, moody's had $7.4 billion of outstanding debt and approximately $1 billion of additional capacity available under the company's cp program, which is backstopped by the $1.25 billion 2021 facility.
future interest payments and fees associated with the company's debt and credit facility are expected to be $4.8 billion, of which approximately $316 million is expected to be paid over the next twelve months. for additional information on the company's outstanding debt, cp program and 2021 facility, refer to note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
management may consider pursuing additional long-term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for operations, share repurchases and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs.
purchase obligations purchase obligations generally include multi-year agreements with vendors to purchase goods or services and mainly include data center/cloud hosting fees and fees for information technology licensing and maintenance. as of december 31, 2022, these purchase obligations totaled $218 million, of which $138 million is expected to be paid in the next twelve months.
pension and other retirement plan obligations the company does not anticipate making significant contributions to its funded pension plan in the next twelve months. this plan is overfunded at december 31, 2022, and accordingly holds sufficient investments to fund future benefit obligations. payments for the company's unfunded plans are not expected to be material in either the short or long-term. for further information on the company's pension and other retirement plan obligations, refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
on february 9, 2021, the board approved $1 billion in share repurchase authority, and on february 7, 2022, the board approved an additional $750 million of share repurchase authority. at december 31, 2022, the company had approximately $848 million of remaining authority. there is no established expiration date for the remaining authorizations.
restructuring as more fully discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the company is currently in the process of executing the 2022 - 2023 geolocation restructuring program. this program relates to the company's post-covid-19 geolocation strategy and includes the rationalization and exit of certain real estate leases and a reduction in staff, including the relocation of certain job functions from their current locations. future cash outlays associated with this program are expected to be approximately $60 million to $80 million, which are expected to be paid through 2024.
sources of funding to satisfy material cash requirements the company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements and expects to have positive operating cash flow in 2023. cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the company's profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. the company may also borrow from various sources as described above.
in addition to its reported results, moody's has included in this md&a certain adjusted results that the sec defines as "non-gaap financial measures." management believes that such adjusted financial measures, when read in conjunction with the company's reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period-to-period comparisons of the company's performance, facilitate comparisons to competitors' operating results and can provide greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. these adjusted measures, as defined by the company, are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of other companies. furthermore, these adjusted measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other gaap measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the company. below are brief descriptions of the company's adjusted financial measures accompanied by a reconciliation of the adjusted measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure.
the company presents adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin because management deems these metrics to be useful measures to provide additional perspective on moody's operating performance. adjusted operating income excludes the impact of: i) depreciation and amortization; and ii) restructuring charges/adjustments. depreciation and amortization are excluded because companies utilize productive assets of different useful lives and use different methods of acquiring and depreciating productive assets. restructuring charges/adjustments are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these charges may vary widely across periods and companies.
management believes that the exclusion of the aforementioned items, as detailed in the reconciliation below, allows for an additional perspective on the company's operating results from period to period and across companies. the company defines adjusted operating margin as adjusted operating income divided by revenue.
the company presents adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps because management deems these metrics to be useful measures to provide additional perspective on moody's operating performance. adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps exclude the impact of: i) amortization of acquired intangible assets; ii) restructuring charges/adjustments; iii) a gain on the extinguishment of debt; iv) fx translation losses reclassified to earnings resulting from the company no longer conducting commercial operations in russia; and v) a non-cash gain relating to the company's minority investment in bitsight.
the company excludes the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets as companies utilize intangible assets with different estimated useful lives and have different methods of acquiring and amortizing intangible assets. these intangible assets were recorded as part of acquisition accounting and contribute to revenue generation. the amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. furthermore, the timing and magnitude of business combination transactions are not predictable and the purchase price allocated to amortizable intangible assets and the related amortization period are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from period to period and across companies. restructuring charges/adjustments, the gain on extinguishment of debt, fx translation losses reclassified to earnings resulting from the company no longer conducting commercial operations in russia, and the non-cash gain relating to the company's minority interest in bitsight are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these items may vary widely across periods and companies.
the company excludes the aforementioned items to provide additional perspective when comparing net income and diluted eps from period to period and across companies as the frequency and magnitude of similar transactions may vary widely across periods.

the company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus payments for capital additions. management believes that free cash flow is a useful metric in assessing the company's cash flows to service debt, pay dividends and to fund acquisitions and share repurchases. management deems capital expenditures essential to the company's product and service innovations and maintenance of moody's operational capabilities. accordingly, capital expenditures are deemed to be a recurring use of moody's cash flow. below is a reconciliation of the company's net cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow:

inorganic revenue from acquisitions                                         (234)                           -                       (234)
inorganic revenue from acquisitions                                           (2)                           -                         (2)
inorganic revenue from acquisitions                                         (236)                           -                       (236)
the company presents annualized recurring revenue ("arr") on a constant currency organic basis for its ma business as a supplemental performance metric to provide additional insight on the estimated value of ma's recurring revenue contracts at a given point in time. the company uses arr to manage and monitor performance of its ma operating segment and believes that this metric is a key indicator of the trajectory of ma's recurring revenue base.
the company calculates arr by taking the total recurring contract value for each active renewable contract as of the reporting date, divided by the number of days in the contract and multiplied by 365 days to create an annualized value. the company defines renewable contracts as subscriptions, term licenses, maintenance and renewable services. arr excludes transaction sales including training, one-time services and perpetual licenses. in order to compare period-over-period arr excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, the company bases the calculation on currency rates utilized in its current year operating budget and holds these fx rates constant for the duration of all current and prior periods being reported. additionally, arr excludes contracts related to acquisitions to provide additional perspective in assessing growth excluding the impacts from certain acquisition activity.
the company's definition of arr may differ from definitions utilized by other companies reporting similarly named measures, and this metric should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures presented in accordance with u.s. gaap.

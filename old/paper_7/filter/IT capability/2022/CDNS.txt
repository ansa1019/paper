item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k and with part i, item 1a, "risk factors." please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report on form 10-k regarding forward-looking statements.
business overview cadence is a leader in electronic system design, building upon more than 30 years of computational software expertise. we apply our underlying intelligent system design strategy to deliver computational software, hardware and ip that turn design concepts into reality. we enable our customers to develop electronic products. our products and services are designed to give our customers a competitive edge in their development of integrated ics, socs, and increasingly sophisticated electronic devices and systems. our products and services do this by optimizing performance, minimizing power consumption, shortening the time to bring our customers' products to market, improving engineering productivity and reducing their design, development and manufacturing costs.
we group our products into categories related to major design activities:
•digital ic design and signoff;
table of contents consistent with our intelligent system design strategy, we completed our acquisitions of openeye and future facilities during fiscal 2022. both of these acquisitions are expected to add important new technologies and capabilities to our system design and analysis technology portfolio that we believe will enhance our ability to pursue attractive opportunities in the markets we serve. during fiscal 2022, these acquisitions increased expenses, including amortization of acquired intangible assets more than revenue.
for additional information about our products, see the discussion in item 1, "business," under the heading "products and product categories."
management uses certain performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items further below under the headings "results of operations" and "liquidity and capital resources."
fiscal year end on september 7, 2022, our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year end from the saturday closest to december 31 of each year to december 31 of each year. our fiscal quarters will end on march 31, june 30, and september 30. the fiscal year change is effective beginning with our 2023 fiscal year, which began on january 1, 2023.
macroeconomic environment our business is subject to the effects of expanded trade restrictions, the ongoing geopolitical conflict in ukraine and other areas of the world, the covid-19 pandemic, volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, global inflation and the rise in interest rates.
we have been impacted by expanded trade restrictions, including restrictions concerning advanced node ic production in china, the inclusion of additional chinese technology companies on the bis's "unverified list" and regulations governing the sale of certain technologies. based on our current assessments, we expect the impact of these expanded trade restrictions on our business to be limited.
we also continuously monitor geopolitical conflicts around the world and their effects on our business. during the first half of fiscal 2022, due to the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine and the corresponding sanctions imposed by the united states and other countries, we terminated our operations in russia. the termination of our operations in russia has not limited our ability to develop or support our products and has not had a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows. we do not have operations or employees in ukraine.
since its inception, the covid-19 pandemic has posed a variety of challenges to our day-to-day operations. despite these challenges, the pandemic has not had a material, adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows. while we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that covid-19 and its continuing repercussions will have on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows, we have implemented policies and practices that have enabled us to support critical operations and execute our strategy.
while our business model provides some resilience against these factors, we will continue to monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these or similar circumstances on our business and financial results. for additional information on the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business, see part i, item 1a, "risk factors."
results of operations the discussion of our fiscal 2022 consolidated results of operations include year-over-year comparisons to fiscal 2021 for revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, other non-operating expenses, income taxes and cash flows. for a discussion of the fiscal 2021 changes compared to fiscal 2020, see the discussion in item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended january 1, 2022, filed on february 22, 2022.
•continued investment in research and development activities and technical sales support; and
•increased provision for income taxes primarily due to changes to tax laws in the united states.
table of contents generally, between 85% and 90% of our annual revenue is characterized as recurring revenue. recurring revenue includes revenue recognized over time from our software arrangements, services, royalties, maintenance on ip licenses and hardware, and operating leases of hardware. recurring revenue also includes revenue recognized at varying points in time over the term of other arrangements with non-cancelable commitments, whereby the customer commits to a fixed dollar amount over a specified period of time that can be used to purchase from a list of products or services.
the remainder of our revenue is recognized at a point in time and is characterized as up-front revenue. up-front revenue is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and individual ip licenses. the percentage of our recurring and up-front revenue and fluctuations in revenue within our geographies are impacted by delivery of hardware and ip products to our customers in any single fiscal period.
revenue from arrangements with non-cancelable commitments             2   %              3   %
while the percentage of revenue characterized as recurring compared to revenue characterized as up-front may vary between fiscal quarters, the overall mix of revenue is relatively consistent on an annual basis or over the course of twelve consecutive months. the following table shows the percentage of recurring revenue for the twelve-month periods ending concurrently with our five most recent fiscal quarters:
digital ic design and signoff                                                    28   %             29   %
revenue by product category fluctuates from period to period based on demand for our products and services, our available resources and our ability to deliver and support them. certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products. additionally, we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products, with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. for these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product categories based upon the expected usage of our products. the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the table above would differ.
united states                             $1,577.9                      $1,293.0                                              $284.9                      22   %
revenue in each of the six geographies presented in the table above increased during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, due to increased revenue from our software offerings. revenue in the united states and china also increased during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, due to increased revenue from our hardware and ip offerings.
united states                             44   %             43   %
most of our revenue is transacted in the united states dollar. however, certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies. for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion under item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency risk."
cost of product and maintenance cost of product and maintenance includes costs associated with the sale and lease of our emulation and prototyping hardware and licensing of our software and ip products, certain employee salary and benefits and other employee-related costs, cost of our customer support services, amortization of technology-related and maintenance-related acquired intangibles, costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors. cost of product and maintenance depends primarily on our hardware product sales in any given period, but is also affected by employee salary and benefits and other employee-related costs, reserves for inventory, and the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets, license third-party technology or ip, and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed technology or ip.
salary, benefits and other employee-related costs                   4.9
other items                                                         0.8
costs associated with our emulation and prototyping hardware products include components, assembly, testing, applicable reserves and overhead. these costs make our cost of emulation and prototyping hardware products higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software and ip products. the increase in emulation and prototyping hardware costs during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was primarily due to increased revenue from emulation and prototyping hardware products.
table of contents cost of services cost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs to perform work on revenue-generating projects and costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization. cost of services may fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenue-generating projects rather than internal development projects.
operating expenses our operating expenses include marketing and sales, research and development, and general and administrative expense. factors that tend to cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions, our annual mid-year promotion and pay raise cycle, stock-based compensation, restructuring and other employment separation activities, foreign exchange rate movements, acquisition-related costs, volatility in variable compensation programs that are driven by operating results, and charitable donations.
during fiscal 2021, we offered a voluntary retirement program to eligible employees in the united states. this program resulted in a one-time charge for voluntary termination and post-employment benefits of $26.8 million. as of december 31, 2022, liabilities related to the voluntary retirement program were $0.4 million and were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. we expect to make cash payments to settle these liabilities during fiscal 2023.
many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies. we recognize lower expenses in periods when the united states dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the united states dollar weakens against other currencies. for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency risk."
salary, benefits and other employee-related costs              $24.0
facilities and other infrastructure costs                        3.9
other items                                                      1.2
salary, benefits and other employee-related costs and stock-based compensation included in marketing and sales increased during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to increased business levels and our continued investment in attracting and retaining talent dedicated to technical sales support. costs related to marketing programs and events increased during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to an increased number of in-person meetings and events.
salary, benefits and other employee-related costs              $76.6
facilities and other infrastructure costs                       11.5
other items                                                      1.7
salary, benefits and other employee-related costs and stock-based compensation included in research and development expense increased during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to our continued investment in attracting and retaining talent for research and development activities. facilities and other infrastructure costs increased during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to an increase in costs associated with our acquisitions and our growing work force.
contributions to non-profit organizations                        8.7
salary, benefits and other employee-related costs                8.5
other items                                                      4.3
as a result of the transition of our chief executive officer and creation of the executive chair role in december of 2021, general and administrative expense for fiscal 2022 includes incremental compensation costs, as compared to fiscal 2021. the increase in stock-based compensation included in general and administrative expense during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, is primarily due to equity awards granted to executives.
professional services and legal fees included in general and administrative expense increased during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to an increase in acquisition-related professional services, legal fees and costs for other matters. the increase in contributions to non-profit organizations during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, is primarily related to increased contributions to the cadence giving foundation in an effort to give back to the communities where our employees live and work.
during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, we benefited from a non-recurring foreign service tax refund, offsetting the increase in other categories of general and administrative expense.
revolving credit facility                     2.8                       0.7
interest expense increased during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to increased interest expense associated with amounts outstanding under our 2025 term loan and our 2021 credit facility. interest rates under our 2025 term loan and 2021 credit facility are variable, so interest expense is affected by changes in interest rates, particularly for periods when we maintain a balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. as of december 31, 2022, we had outstanding borrowings of $100.0 million under our 2021 credit facility to fund domestic working capital and for other general corporate requirements. for an additional description of our debt arrangements, including our 2025 term loan and 2021 credit facility, see note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act in december 2017, which requires companies to capitalize all of their r&d costs, including software development costs, incurred in tax years beginning after december 31, 2021. beginning in fiscal 2022, we began capitalizing and amortizing r&d costs over five years for domestic research and fifteen years for international research rather than expensing these costs as incurred. as a result, our fiscal 2022 effective tax rate and our cash tax payments increased significantly as compared to fiscal 2021. we recognized increases to our deferred tax assets as we begin to capitalize domestic research costs.
our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2022 was primarily attributable to federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2022 income, partially offset by the tax benefit of $42.1 million related to stock-based compensation that vested or was exercised during the period. we also recognized a tax benefit of $68.7 million related to the release of the valuation allowance on our california r&d tax credits because we expect to utilize these tax credits based on strong current earnings and future taxable income projections.
our provision for fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2021 income, partially offset by the tax benefit of $22.1 million related to our foreign-derived intangible income, and the tax benefit of $64.3 million related to stock-based compensation that vested or was exercised during the period. we also recognized a tax benefit of $10.5 million related to the release of the valuation allowance on our massachusetts r&d tax credits because we expect to utilize these tax credits prior to expiration based on strong current earnings and future taxable income projections.
table of contents our future effective tax rates may also be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the united states federal statutory rate, research credits, the tax impact of stock-based compensation, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, closure of statutes of limitations or settlement of tax audits and changes in tax law. a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary. our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates. we currently expect that our fiscal 2023 effective tax rate will be approximately 26%. we expect that our quarterly effective tax rates will vary from our fiscal 2023 effective tax rate as a result of recognizing the income tax effects of stock-based awards in the quarterly periods that the awards vest or are settled and other items that we cannot anticipate. for additional discussion about how our effective tax rate could be affected by various risks, see part i, item 1a, "risk factors." for further discussion regarding our income taxes, see note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
liquidity and capital resources as of                                                         change december 31,                     january 1,                                       2022 vs. 2021
net working capital              359.1                744.5                                                       (385.4)
cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $882.3 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to $1,088.9 million as of january 1, 2022.
our primary uses of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2022 were payments related to salaries and benefits, operating expenses, repurchases of our common stock, payments for business combinations, net of cash acquired, payments for income taxes, purchases of inventory, payment of employee taxes on vesting of restricted stock and purchases of property, plant and equipment.
approximately 76% of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2022. our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries may vary from period to period due to the timing of collections and repatriation of foreign earnings. we expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances and cash flows that are generated from operations and financing activities will be sufficient to meet the needs of our domestic and international operating activities and other capital and liquidity requirements, including acquisitions and share repurchases, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
net working capital net working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets. the decrease in our net working capital as of december 31, 2022, as compared to january 1, 2022, is primarily due to our use of cash for investing and financing activities and the timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors.
cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2022 and 2021 were as follows:
cash provided by operating activities           $1,241.9                  $1,101.0                                            $140.9
cash flows from operating activities include net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our customer agreements. the increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was primarily due to improved results from operations and timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors.
table of contents cash flows used for investing activities cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2022 and 2021 were as follows:
cash used for investing activities        $(738.6)                  $(293.0)                                          $(445.6)
the increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was primarily due to an increase in cash paid in business combinations, net of cash acquired, and an increase in payments for purchases of property, plant and equipment. we expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, acquiring other companies and businesses, purchasing software licenses, and making strategic investments.
cash flows used for financing activities cash flows used for financing activities during fiscal 2022 and 2021 were as follows:
cash used for financing activities        $(657.0)                  $(643.8)                                          $(13.2)
the increase in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was primarily due to an increase in payments for repurchases of our common stock, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from debt.
other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources stock repurchase program in august 2022, our board of directors increased the prior authorization to repurchase shares of our common stock by authorizing an additional $1.0 billion. the actual timing and amount of repurchases are subject to business and market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities and other factors. as of december 31, 2022, approximately $1.1 billion of the share repurchase authorization remained available to repurchase shares of our common stock. see part ii, item 5, "market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" for additional information on share repurchases.
revolving credit facility in june 2021, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders led by bank of america, n.a., as administrative agent, as amended in september 2022 (the "2021 credit facility"). the 2021 credit facility provides for borrowings up to $700.0 million, with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional $350.0 million upon receipt of lender commitments, for total maximum borrowings of $1.05 billion. the 2021 credit facility expires on june 30, 2026. any outstanding loans drawn under the 2021 credit facility are due at maturity on june 30, 2026, subject to an option to extend the maturity date. outstanding borrowings may be repaid at any time prior to maturity. interest rates associated with the 2021 credit facility are variable, so interest expense is impacted by changes in interest rates, particularly for periods when there are outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. as of december 31, 2022, there were $100.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the 2021 credit facility, and we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with such credit facility.
2024 notes in october 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% senior notes due october 15, 2024 (the "2024 notes"). we received net proceeds of $342.4 million from the issuance of the 2024 notes, net of a discount of $1.4 million and issuance costs of $6.2 million. interest is payable in cash semi-annually. the 2024 notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness. as of december 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the 2024 notes.
2025 term loan in september 2022, we entered into a $300.0 million three-year senior non-amortizing term loan facility due on september 7, 2025 with a group of lenders led by bank of america, n.a., as administrative agent (the "2025 term loan"). the 2025 term loan is unsecured and ranks equal in right of payment to all of our unsecured indebtedness. proceeds from the 2025 term loan were used to fund our acquisition of openeye. interest rates associated with the 2025 term loan are variable, so interest expense is impacted by changes in interest rates. as of december 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with the 2025 term loan.
for additional information relating to our debt arrangements, see note 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. for additional information relating to openeye and other acquisitions, see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
other liquidity requirements a summary of other capital and liquidity requirements as of december 31, 2022 is as follows:
(3)    in 2022, we received a tax audit assessment from the korea taxing authorities primarily related to value-added taxes for years 2017-2019. we are required to pay these assessed taxes, prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the assessment. we paid the assessment in january 2023. payment of this amount is not an admission that we are subject to such taxes, and we continue to defend our position vigorously.
(4)    included in other long-term contractual obligations are long-term income tax liabilities of $63 million related to unrecognized tax benefits. the remaining portion of other long-term contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisitions.
we expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows that are generated from operations and financing activities will be sufficient to meet the needs of our domestic and international operating activities, and other capital and liquidity requirements, including acquisitions and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
as of december 31, 2022, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our operating results or financial condition.
table of contents critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. we base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. at least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary.
we believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes, revenue recognition and business combinations have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements; therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. for information on our significant accounting policies, see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple software and/or ip licenses, hardware and services, including professional services, technical support services, and rights to unspecified updates to a customer. these contracts require us to apply judgment in identifying and evaluating any terms and conditions in contracts which may impact revenue recognition. determining whether licenses and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately, or not distinct and thus accounted for together, requires significant judgment. in some arrangements, such as most of our ip license arrangements, we have concluded that the licenses and associated services are distinct from each other. in other arrangements, like our time-based software arrangements, the licenses and certain services are not distinct from each other. our time-based software arrangements include multiple software licenses and updates to the licensed software products, as well as technical support, and we have concluded that these promised goods and services are a single, combined performance obligation.
judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling prices ("ssps") for each distinct performance obligation. we rarely license or sell products on a standalone basis, so we are required to estimate the ssp for each performance obligation. in instances where the ssp is not directly observable because we do not sell the license, product or service separately, we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. we typically have more than one ssp for individual performance obligations due to the stratification of those items by classes of customers and circumstances. in these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region of the customer in determining the ssp.
if a group of agreements are so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such agreements are deemed to be one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes. we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate agreements should be accounted for separately or as, in substance, a single arrangement. our judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved.
we are required to estimate the total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers. in some circumstances, the consideration expected to be received is variable based on the specific terms of the contract or based on our expectations of the term of the contract. generally, we have not experienced significant returns or refunds to customers. these estimates require significant judgment and the change in these estimates could have an effect on our results of operations during the periods involved.
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes. there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances, changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws, and developments in current and future tax examinations.
table of contents we only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained, solely on its technical merits, in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. to make this judgment, we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws, regulations and administrative practices. if we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold, then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% cumulative probability of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts. it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes. we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, the lapse of applicable statute of limitations, and new audit activity. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. for a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits, see note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
business combinations when we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities, including deferred revenue, liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets. any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill. these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies, our assessment of this information, and historical experience. these estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future, the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. in addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and if such events occur, we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities.
we also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite-lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. these estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. in addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets, which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations.
with our acquisitions of openeye and future facilities, we acquired combined intangible assets of $155.5 million. for existing technology acquired with openeye and future facilities, the fair value was determined by applying the relief-from-royalty method. this method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue to quantify the benefit of owning the intangible asset rather than paying a royalty for use of the asset. to estimate royalty savings over time, we projected revenue from the acquired existing technology over the estimated remaining life of the technology, including the effect of assumed technological obsolescence, before applying an assumed royalty rate. for both openeye and future facilities, we assumed technological obsolescence at a rate of 10% annually, before applying an assumed royalty rate of 25%.
the fair value for agreements and relationships acquired with our acquisitions of openeye and future facilities was determined by using the multi-period excess earnings method. this method reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated from existing customers, less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. projected income from existing customer relationships was determined using customer retention rates between 95% and 100% for openeye and 95% for future facilities. the present value of operating cash flows from existing customers was determined using discount rates ranging from 10% to 11%.
we also completed three other business combinations with combined intangible assets of $23.1 million. the fair value of certain intangible assets acquired was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, a variation of the income approach that utilizes unobservable inputs classified as level 3 measurements. this method estimates the revenue and cash flows derived from the acquired assets, net of investment in supporting assets. the resulting cash flow, which is attributable solely to the assets acquired, is then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the associated risk of the asset to calculate the present value. we assumed discount rates ranging from 11.5% to 24.5%. the fair value of the remaining intangible assets acquired was determined using the relief-from-royalty method using a technological obsolescence rate of approximately 12% annually, before applying a royalty rate of 25%.

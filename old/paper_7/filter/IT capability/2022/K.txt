proposed separation transaction on june 21, 2022, the company announced its intent to separate its north american cereal and plant-based foods businesses, via tax-free spin-offs, with a target to complete the transactions by the end of 2023, resulting in three independent public companies, each better positioned to unlock their full standalone potential. after exploring strategic options, the company has decided to retain its plant-based business. the proposed separation of the north american cereal business is expected to create greater strategic, operational, and financial focus for the company and its stakeholders, and will build on our current momentum.
war in ukraine the war in ukraine and the related sanctions imposed have increased global economic and geopolitical uncertainty. in march 2022, we suspended all new investments and shipments of all products to russia. we have no employees or direct operations in ukraine. our business in russia consists of three manufacturing facilities and represented approximately 1% of consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31, 2022.
in december 2022 the company entered into an agreement to sell our russian business to a third party, pending a number of local government regulatory approvals. the business is a part of our europe reportable segment. the pending sale includes the entirety of the company's operations in russia and will result in a complete exit from the market. although the company has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its russian business, there is no assurance that we will obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or that the other conditions to complete the sale will be satisfied.
at the end of 2022 the pending sale did not meet the criteria for held for sale accounting due to uncertainty related to the evolving regulatory approvals that are required in order to complete the transaction. if approved, the company expects to incur a loss on the transaction due to the release of historical foreign currency translation adjustments (cta). the net book value of the assets related to the russian business, including historical cta losses, represents less than 1% of total company assets as of december 31, 2022.
impacts of the war to our net sales, earnings, and cash flows extends beyond our business in russia. regional or global economic recessions, inflation, and supply chain challenges as a result of the war or further escalation could have a material impact on our results.
since the world health organization categorized the novel coronavirus (covid-19) as a pandemic in march 2020, our key objectives continue to be 1) protecting the health and safety of our employees, 2) safely producing and delivering our foods to customers and consumers, and 3) supporting the communities in which we operate.
the company continues to actively monitor covid-19 and will adjust our mitigation strategies as necessary to address any changing health, operational or financial risks that may arise. during the first year of the pandemic, the company experienced a significant increase in demand for food for at-home consumption. while this demand has moderated for certain products, we will continue to manage our production capacity during this period of volatility. we continue to monitor the business for adverse impacts of the pandemic, including volatility in the foreign exchange markets, reduced demand in our away from home businesses, supply-chain disruptions in certain markets, increased costs of maintaining food supply, and potential disruptions for certain emerging market countries. in the event the company experiences adverse impacts from the above or other factors, the company would also evaluate the need to perform interim impairment tests of the company's goodwill, indefinite lived intangible assets, investments in unconsolidated affiliates and property, plant and equipment. there can be no assurance that volatility and/or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
inflationary pressures events such as the ongoing covid-19 pandemic and the war in ukraine have resulted in certain impacts to the global economy, including market disruptions, supply chain challenges, and inflationary pressures. during the year ended december 31, 2022 we continued to experience elevated commodity and supply chain costs, including logistics, procurement, and manufacturing costs. we expect these market disruptions and inflationary pressures to persist into 2023.
segments we manage our operations through four operating segments that are based on geographic location - north america which includes the u.s. businesses and canada; europe which consists principally of european countries; latin america which consists of central and south america and includes mexico; and amea (asia middle east africa) which consists of africa, middle east, australia and other asian and pacific markets. these operating segments also represent our reportable segments non-gaap financial measures this filing includes non-gaap financial measures that we provide to management and investors that exclude certain items that we do not consider part of on-going operations. items excluded from our non-gaap financial measures are discussed in the "significant items impacting comparability" section of this filing. our management team consistently utilizes a combination of gaap and non-gaap financial measures to evaluate business results, to make decisions regarding the future direction of our business, and for resource allocation decisions, including incentive compensation. as a result, we believe the presentation of both gaap and non-gaap financial measures provides investors with increased transparency into financial measures used by our management team and improves investors' understanding of our underlying operating performance and in their analysis of ongoing operating trends. all historic non-gaap financial measures have been reconciled with the most directly comparable gaap financial measures.
non-gaap financial measures non-gaap financial measures used for evaluation of performance include currency-neutral and organic net sales, adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted operating profit, adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted diluted earnings per share (eps), adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted gross profit, adjusted and currency neutral adjusted gross margin, net debt and cash flow. we determine currency-neutral results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current period u.s. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. these non-gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
•currency-neutral net sales and organic net sales: we adjust the gaap financial measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency, resulting in currency-neutral net sales. in addition, we exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency, and differences in shipping days including 53rd week, resulting in organic net sales. we excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying net sales performance. by providing these non-gaap net sales measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of net sales performance for the company and each of our reportable segments for the periods presented. management uses these non-gaap measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives behind net sales growth, pricing realization, and the impact of mix on our business results. these non-gaap measures are also used to make decisions regarding the future direction of our business, and for resource allocation decisions.
•adjusted: gross profit, gross margin, operating profit and diluted eps: we adjust the gaap financial measures to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, costs of the proposed separation transactions, mark-to-market adjustments for pension and postretirement plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodity contracts, certain equity investments and certain foreign currency contracts, multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, a gain on interest rate swaps, and other costs impacting comparability resulting in adjusted. we excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying profitability. by providing these non-gaap profitability measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the company's profitability measures for the periods presented. management uses these non-gaap financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability, as well as to evaluate the impacts of inflationary pressures and decisions to invest in new initiatives within each of our segments.
•currency-neutral adjusted: gross profit, gross margin, operating profit, and diluted eps: we adjust the gaap financial measures to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, costs of the proposed separation transactions, mark-to-market adjustments for pension and postretirement plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodity contracts, certain equity investments and certain foreign currency contracts, multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, a gain on interest rate swaps, and other costs impacting comparability, and foreign currency, resulting in currency-neutral adjusted. we excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying profitability. by providing these non-gaap profitability measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the company's profitability measures for the periods presented. management uses these non-gaap financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability, as well as to evaluate the impacts of inflationary pressures and decisions to invest in new initiatives within each of our segments.
•adjusted effective income tax rate: we adjust the gaap financial measures to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, costs of the proposed separation transactions, mark-to-market adjustments for pension and postretirement plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodity contracts, certain equity investments, and certain foreign currency contracts, a gain on interest rate swaps, and other costs impacting comparability. we excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our pre-tax income and the related tax effect of those items on our adjusted effective income tax rate, and other impacts to tax expense, including tax reform in the uk and u.s. and certain foreign valuation allowances. by providing this non-gaap measure, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the company's effective tax rate, excluding the pre-tax income and tax effect of the items noted above, for the periods presented. management uses this non-gaap measure to monitor the effectiveness of initiatives in place to optimize our global tax rate.
•net debt: defined as the sum of long-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt and notes payable, less cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities. with respect to net debt, cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities are subtracted from the gaap measure, total debt liabilities, because they could be used to reduce the company's debt obligations. company management and investors use this non-gaap measure to evaluate changes to the company's capital structure and credit quality assessment.
•cash flow: defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. we use this non-gaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases once all of the company's business needs and obligations are met. additionally, certain performance-based compensation includes a component of this non-gaap measure.
these measures have not been calculated in accordance with gaap and should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap reporting measures.
significant items impacting comparability mark-to-market we recognize mark-to-market adjustments for pension and postretirement benefit plans, commodity contracts, and certain foreign currency contracts as incurred. actuarial gains/losses for pension plans were recognized in the year they occur. mark-to-market gains/losses for certain equity investments are recorded based on observable price changes. changes between contract and market prices for commodities contracts and certain foreign currency contracts result in gains/losses that were recognized in the quarter they occur. we recorded a total pre-tax mark-to-market charge of $574 million for 2022, a total pre-tax market-to-market gain of $166 million for 2021 and a total pre-tax mark-to-market charge of $162 million for 2020. included within the aforementioned totals was a pre-tax mark-to-market charge for pension plans of $414 million for 2022, pre-tax mark-to-market gain for pension plans of $164 million for 2021, and a pre-tax mark-to-market charge for pension plans of $154 million for 2020.
separation costs the company continues to work towards its planned separation of its north america cereal business. as a result, we incurred pre-tax charges related to the proposed separation, primarily related to legal and consulting costs, of $61 million for 2022.
business and portfolio realignment one-time costs related to reorganizations in support of our deploy for growth priorities and a reshaped portfolio; investments in enhancing capabilities prioritized by our deploy for growth strategy; and completed and prospective divestitures and acquisitions. as a result, we incurred pre-tax charges, primarily related to reorganizations of $21 million in 2022, $36 million in 2021 and $38 million in 2020.
gain related to interest rate swaps during the third quarter of 2022, the company recognized a pre-tax gain of $18 million in interest expense related to a portion of certain forward-starting interest rate swaps no longer designated as cash flow hedges due to changes in forecasted debt issuance.
foreign valuation allowance during the third quarter of 2021, the company determined that certain foreign deferred tax assets were no longer more likely than not to be realized in the future and a full valuation allowance of $20 million was recorded.
uk tax rate change during the second quarter of 2021, the company recorded tax expense of $23 million as a result of tax legislation enacted in the uk in june of 2021, which increased the statutory uk tax rate from 19 percent to 25 percent and required us to re-value our net uk deferred tax liability balance to reflect this higher rate.
multi-employer pension plan exit liability during the second quarter of 2020, the company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $5 million related to the settlement of one multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liability from the prior year.
impact of shipping day differences including 53rd week during the fourth quarter of 2020, the company had a difference in shipping days resulting from an additional week of business during the fiscal year. this impact increased reported net sales by $174 million for the year ended january 2, 2021.

financial results for the full year ended december 31, 2022, our reported net sales increased 8.0% versus the prior year on positive price/mix across all regions partially offset by a modest decline in volume and foreign currency. growth was led by snacks across all four regions and consolidated net sales grew in cereal and noodles and other. organic net sales increased 11.5% from the prior year after excluding the impact of foreign currency.
reported operating profit decreased 6.7% versus the prior year due primarily to unfavorable mark-to-market impacts, costs related to the company's pending separation, and foreign currency, as well as economy-wide supply disruptions and input cost inflation that persisted throughout the year. currency-neutral adjusted operating profit increased 7.0%, after excluding the impact of mark-to-market, separation costs, and foreign currency.
reported diluted eps of $2.79 for the year decreased 35.6% compared to the prior year eps of $4.33 due primarily to unfavorable mark-to-market and costs related to the company's pending separation. currency-neutral adjusted diluted eps of $4.38 for the year increased 5.3% compared to prior year eps of $4.16, after excluding the impact of significant items impacting comparability.

(a) gross profit is equal to net sales less cost of goods sold.
restructuring programs periodically, the company may initiate a restructuring program to achieve it's long-term profit growth targets. initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a 3 to 5-year period subsequent to completion. completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi-year programs), is when the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation.
during 2021, the company announced a reconfiguration of the north america reportable segment supply chain network, designed to drive increased productivity. the project is expected to be substantially completed by early 2024, with related productivity improvements commencing in 2023. the overall project is expected to result in cumulative pretax charges of approximately $45 million, which include employee-related costs of $4 million, other cash costs of $21 million and non-cash costs, primarily consisting of accelerated depreciation and asset write-off's, of $20 million. charges incurred related to this restructuring program were approximately $6 million and $5 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively. these charges primarily related to severance, accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs, and were recorded in cogs. total program costs to date for the life of this project was $11 million as of december 31, 2022.
in addition to the project discussed above, the company incurred restructuring costs in each of its reportable segments related to various reorganization and simplification initiatives and supply chain optimization projects. the company recorded total restructuring charges of $11 million, $27 million and $29 million across all restructuring programs during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily related to employee severance charges, accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs.
foreign currency translation the reporting currency for our financial statements is the u.s. dollar. certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, primarily in the euro, british pound, mexican peso, australian dollar, canadian dollar, brazilian real, nigerian naira, russian ruble, polish zloty, and egyptian pound. to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues into u.s. dollars at the applicable exchange rates. as a result, increases and decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the u.s. dollar is substantial.
interest expense interest expense was $218 million and $223 million for the years ended december 31, 2022 and january 1, 2022, respectively. the decrease from the prior year is due primarily to an $18 million gain related to a portion of certain forward-starting interest rate swaps no longer designated as cash flow hedges due to changes in forecasted debt issuance. interest expense capitalized as part of the construction cost of fixed assets was immaterial for both periods.
interest income (recorded in other income (expense), net) was $33 million and $12 million for the years ended december 31, 2022 and january 1, 2022, respectively.
income taxes our reported effective tax rate for 2022 and 2021 was 20.4% and 24.1%, respectively.
the lower effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to the prior year, was due to a decrease in net discrete tax expense.
the 2021 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by tax legislation in the uk and the establishment of a full valuation allowance related to certain foreign deferred tax assets. during the second quarter of 2021, the company recorded tax expense of $23 million as a result of tax legislation enacted in the uk in june 2021, which increased the statutory uk tax rate from 19 percent to 25 percent for tax periods after april 1, 2023. the company revalued its net deferred tax balances related to the uk business to reflect the increased tax rate. additionally, during the third quarter, the company determined that certain foreign deferred tax assets were no longer more likely than not to be realized in the future and a full valuation allowance totaling $20 million was recorded on a discrete period basis.
adjusted effective tax rates for 2022 and 2021 were 21.5% and 21.9%, respectively.
the following table provides a reconciliation of reported to adjusted income taxes and effective income tax rate for 2022 and 2021.

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon u.s. dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory rates. additionally, the rate could be impacted by tax legislation and if pending uncertain tax matters, including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives, are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect.
liquidity and capital resources at this time, the covid-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity and we anticipate current cash and marketable security balances, operating cash flows, together with our credit facilities and other financing sources including commercial paper, credit and bond markets, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs. we expect cash provided by operating activities of $1.7-$1.8 billion and capital expenditures of approximately $700 million in 2023. we currently have $2.5 billion of unused revolving credit agreements, including $1.5 billion effective through 2026 and $1.0 billion effective through december 2023, as well as continued access to the commercial paper markets. we are currently in compliance with all debt covenants and do not have material uncertainty about our ability to maintain compliance in future periods. we continue to utilize available capacity within the monetization programs to maintain financial flexibility without negatively impacting working capital. as the impact of covid-19 on the economy and our operations evolves, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs.
our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions. our cash-generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs.
we have historically reported negative working capital primarily as the result of our focus to improve core working capital by reducing our levels of trade receivables and inventory while extending the timing of payment of our trade payables. the impacts of the extended customer terms programs and of the monetization programs are included in our calculation of core working capital and are largely offsetting. these programs are all part of our ongoing working capital management.
we periodically monitor our supplier payment terms to assess whether our terms are competitive and in line with local market terms. to the extent that such assessment indicates that our supplier payment terms are not aligned with local market terms, we may seek to adjust our terms, including extending or shortening our payment due dates as appropriate. supplier payment term modifications did not have a material impact on our cash flows during 2022, and are not expected to have a material impact in 2023.
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which results in current maturities of long-term debt and notes payable which can have a significant impact on working capital as a result of the timing of these required payments. these factors, coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations, pay dividends, fund acquisition opportunities, and repurchase our common stock, reduce our working capital amounts.
we had negative working capital of $2.2 billion and $1.9 billion as of december 31, 2022 and january 1, 2022, respectively.
we believe that our operating cash flows, together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing, including commercial paper, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. however, there can be no assurance that volatility and/or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows:
operating activities                                                             $1,651                     $1,701
investing activities                                                              (448)                      (528)
financing activities                                                            (1,081)                    (1,306)
effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents                             (109)                       (16)
operating activities the principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings, primarily cash receipts from the sale of our products, net of costs to manufacture and market our products.
net cash provided by our operating activities for 2022 totaled $1,651 million compared to $1,701 million in the prior year. the decrease is due primarily to net cash outflows related to core working capital, principally related to an increase in accounts receivable resulting from higher net sales, partially offset by changes in incentive compensation and other accruals from the prior year.
our cash conversion cycle (defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding, based on a trailing 12 month average), is approximately negative 6 days and negative 9 days for 2022 and 2021, respectively. core working capital in 2022 averaged 1.7% of net sales compared to 1.0% in 2021.
our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to $23 million and $20 million for the years ended december 31, 2022 and january 1, 2022, respectively.
the pension protection act (ppa), and subsequent regulations, determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the united states. we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until 2024 or beyond. our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance, future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa.
we currently project that we will make total u.s. and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2023 of approximately $26 million. actual 2023 contributions could be different from our current projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities, future changes in government requirements, trust asset performance, renewals of union contracts, or higher-than-expected health care claims cost experience.
we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. we use this non-gaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available over time for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases. our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure, as follows:
net cash provided by operating activities                   $1,651                  $1,701
additions to properties                                      (488)                   (553)
investing activities our net cash used in investing activities for 2022 totaled $448 million compared to $528 million in 2021. the decrease was due primarily to phasing of capital expenditures.
capital spending in 2022 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure, including manufacturing capacity expansions in multiple markets and categories and initiatives targeting waste reductions and productivity improvements.
cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales was 3.2% and 3.9% in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
financing activities our net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,081 million compared to $1,306 million during the prior year. the year-over-year variance was driven primarily by higher proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper in the current year.
(millions, unaudited)                                     december 31, 2022                  january 1, 2022
current maturities of long-term debt         780                              712
total debt liabilities                                       $6,564                           $7,111
in november 2022, we repaid €600 million, five-year 0.80% euro notes due 2022, upon maturity.
in may 2021, we issued €300 million of eight-year 0.50% euro notes due 2029, resulting in net proceeds of €298 million after discount and underwriting commissions. the 2029 euro notes were issued as a sustainability bond, and thus an amount equal to the net proceeds was used to finance, in whole or in part, eligible environmental or social projects described in the company's sustainability bond framework. the notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined) to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions, as well as a change of control provision. additionally, we repaid the €500 million, seven-year 1.75% euro notes due 2021, upon maturity.
we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling $2.34 per share in 2022 versus $2.31 per share in 2021. on february 17, 2023, the board of directors declared a dividend of $.59 per common share, payable on march 15, 2023 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 1, 2023.
we entered into an unsecured five-year credit agreement in december 2021, allowing us to borrow, on a revolving credit basis, up to $1.5 billion and expiring in december 2026.
in december 2022, we entered into an unsecured 364-day credit agreement to borrow, on a revolving credit basis, up to $1.0 billion at any time outstanding, to replace the $1.0 billion 364-day facility that was set to expire in december 2022.
the five-year and 364 day credit agreements which had no outstanding borrowings as december 31, 2022, contain customary covenants and warranties, including specified restrictions on indebtedness, liens and a specified interest expense coverage ratio. if an event of default occurs, then, to the extent permitted, the administrative agents may terminate the commitments under the credit facilities, accelerate any outstanding loans under the agreements, and demand the deposit of cash collateral equal to the lender's letter of credit exposure plus interest. the company was in compliance with all financial covenants contained in these agreements at december 31, 2022.
our notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined) to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions and also contain a change of control provision. there are no significant restrictions on the payment of dividends. we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31, 2022.
the notes do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings. a change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the u.s. short-term debt market and/or increase the cost of refinancing long-term debt in the future. however, even under these circumstances, we would continue to have access to our 364-day credit facility, which expires in december 2023, as well as our five-year credit agreement, which expires in december 2026. this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis, although we do not currently plan to use it.
we monitor the financial strength of our third-party financial institutions, including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities, our derivative financial instruments, and other arrangements.
we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future, while still meeting our operational needs, including the pursuit of select acquisitions. this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow, our short-term borrowings, and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis.
monetization and accounts payable programs we have a program in which customers could extend their payment terms in exchange for the elimination of early payment discounts (extended terms program). in order to mitigate the net working capital impact of the extended terms program for discrete customers, we entered into agreements to sell, on a revolving basis, certain trade accounts receivable balances to third party financial institutions (monetization programs). transfers under the monetization programs are accounted for as sales of receivables resulting in the receivables being de-recognized from our consolidated balance sheet. the monetization programs provide for the continuing sale of certain receivables on a revolving basis until terminated by either party; however the maximum funding from receivables that may be sold at any time is currently $920 million, but may be increased or decreased as customers move in or out of the extended terms program and as additional financial institutions move in or out of the monetization programs. accounts receivable sold of $865 million and $549 million remained outstanding under this arrangement as of december 31, 2022 and january 1, 2022, respectively.
the monetization programs are designed to directly offset the impact the extended terms program would have on the days-sales-outstanding (dso) metric that is critical to the effective management of the company's accounts receivable balance and overall working capital. current dso levels within north america are consistent with dso levels prior to the execution of the extended term program and monetization programs.
refer to note 3 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to the sale of accounts receivable.
we have agreements with third parties (accounts payable program) to provide accounts payable tracking systems which facilitate participating suppliers' ability to monitor and, if elected, sell our payment obligations to designated third-party financial institutions. participating suppliers may, at their sole discretion, make offers to sell one or more of our payment obligations prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price to participating financial institutions. our goal is to capture overall supplier savings, in the form of payment terms or vendor funding, and the agreements facilitate the suppliers' ability to sell payment obligations, while providing them with greater working capital flexibility. we have no economic interest in the sale of these suppliers' receivables and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions concerning these services. our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by suppliers' decisions to sell amounts under the arrangements. however, our right to offset balances due from suppliers against payment obligations is restricted by the agreements for those payment obligations that have been sold by suppliers.
refer to note 1 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to accounts payable.
if financial institutions were to terminate their participation in the monetization programs and we are not able to modify related customer payment terms, working capital could be negatively impacted. additionally, working capital could be negatively impacted if we shorten our supplier payment terms as a result of supplier negotiations. for suppliers participating in the accounts payable programs, financial institutions may terminate their participation or we could experience a downgrade in our credit rating that could result in higher costs to suppliers. if working capital is negatively impacted as a result of these events and we were unable to secure alternative programs, we may have to utilize our various financing arrangements for short-term liquidity or increase our long-term borrowings.
contractual obligationswe have material contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business and we believe cash flow from operations will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. in addition to principal and interest payments on our outstanding long-term debt and notes payable balances, our contractual obligations primarily consist of lease payments, income taxes, pension and postretirement benefits and unconditional purchase obligations.
a summary of our operating and finance lease obligations as of december 31, 2022 can be found in note 8 "leases and other commitments", to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report.
a summary of principal payments for long-term debt as of december 31, 2022 can be found in note 9 "debt", to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report.
interest payments will be approximately $164 million per year from 2023 through 2027 and approximately $747 million in total from 2028 through the last debt maturity date.
a summary of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of december 31, 2022 can be found in notes 11 "pension benefits" and note 12 "nonpension postretirement and postemployment benefits", to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report.
see note 14 "income taxes", to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for discussion of uncertain tax positions.
our unconditional purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business and for marketing, advertising and other services. as of december 31, 2022, unconditional purchase obligations totaled approximately $1.9 billion. approximately $1.5 billion of these unconditional purchase obligations will be settled in the ordinary course of business in the next 12 months.
critical accounting estimates promotional expenditures our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in-store displays and events, feature price discounts, consumer coupons, contests and loyalty programs. the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer. these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs. differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally immaterial and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. on a full-year basis, these subsequent period adjustments represent less than 1% of our company's net sales. however, our company's total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a revenue reduction) are significant, so it is likely our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.
goodwill and other intangible assets we review our operating segment and reporting unit structure annually or as significant changes in the organization occur and assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors affecting our reporting units with goodwill. annually during the fourth quarter, in conjunction with our annual budgeting process, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may instead perform a quantitative impairment test. in our quantitative testing, we compare a reporting unit's estimated fair value with its carrying value with a reporting unit's fair value being estimated using market multiples. this approach employs market multiples based on either sales or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for companies that are comparable to our reporting units. in the event the fair value determined using the market multiple approach is close to carrying value, we may supplement the fair value determination using discounted cash flows that incorporates assumptions surrounding planned growth rates, market-based discount rates and estimates of residual value. the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units. these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market comparables. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we consider the reporting unit impaired and reduce its carrying value of goodwill such that the reporting unit's new carrying value is the estimated fair value.
similarly, we assess indefinite-life intangible assets impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these intangible assets. annually during the fourth quarter, in conjunction with our annual budgeting process, we may perform qualitative testing, or depending on factors such as prior-year test results, current year developments, current risk evaluations and other practical considerations, we may instead perform a quantitative impairment test. in the quantitative testing, we compare an intangible asset's estimated fair value with its carrying value with the intangible asset's fair value being determined using estimates of future cash flows to be generated from that asset based on estimates of future sales, as well as assumptions surrounding earnings growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates consistent with rates used by market participants. these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market comparables. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, we consider the asset impaired and reduce its carrying value to the estimated fair value.
we also evaluate the useful life over which a non-goodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.
at december 31, 2022, goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to $8.0 billion, consisting primarily of goodwill and brands. within this total, approximately $2.0 billion of non-goodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinite-lived, including $1.7 billion related to trademarks, comprised principally of pringles and cracker-related trademarks. the majority of all goodwill and other intangible assets are recorded in our north america reporting unit. the company currently believes the fair value of goodwill and other significant intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to cash flows. our impairment testing performed through the fourth quarter of 2022 consisted of qualitative testing for all reporting unit goodwill and all significant indefinite-lived intangible assets, except for one brand, for which quantitative testing was performed. no heightened risk or qualitative indicators of impairment of individual significant intangible assets or reporting units was identified.
we have $184 million at december 31, 2022 related to one brand in the north america operating segment that primarily relates to snack category products. in performing the quantitative test of this brand, fair value was determined using a relief from royalty valuation method that includes estimates, and significant assumptions, of future cash flows to be generated from that asset based on estimates of future sales, royalty rate and discount rate consistent with rates used by market participants. we determined the fair value of this brand exceeds its carrying value and no heightened risk of impairment exists for the asset.
retirement benefits our company sponsors a number of u.s. and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada. plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance. a majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities with smaller holdings of other investments. we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees' active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans. inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date. major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the health care cost trend rates, the mortality table and improvement scale, and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans, which cover employees in the united states, united kingdom and canada.
our expense recognition policy for pension and nonpension postretirement benefits is to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our results in the year in which they occur. actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually as of our measurement date, which is our fiscal year-end, or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles.
additionally, for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets related to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits we use the fair value of plan assets.
to conduct our annual review of the long-term rate of return on plan assets, we model expected returns over a 20-year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans. the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on long-term bonds, price-earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and long-term inflation. our u.s. plan model, corresponding to approximately 69% of our trust assets globally, currently incorporates a long-term inflation assumption of 2.5% and a 2022 weighted-average active management premium of 0.78% for the pension plans and 0.89% for the retiree medical plan, (net of fees) validated by historical analysis and future return expectations. although we review our expected long-term rates of return annually, our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. our expected rates of return have generally not been revised, provided these rates continue to fall within a "more likely than not" corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected long-term returns, as determined by our modeling process. because of a change in the asset mixes between the us pension and retiree medical trusts, separate rate of return assumptions were used in 2022. our assumed rate of return for u.s. plans in 2022 was 6.25% for the pension plans and 7.00% for the retiree medical plan, which equated to approximately the
63rd and 55th percentile expectations of our model, respectively. similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets, reflecting local economic conditions. foreign trust investments represent approximately 31% of our global benefit plan assets.
based on consolidated benefit plan assets at december 31, 2022, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would correspondingly decrease or increase 2023 benefits expense by approximately $40 million. for the years ended december 31, 2022 and january 1, 2022, our actual return on plan assets was less than the recognized assumed return by $1.9 billion and $33 million, respectively.
pension assets include a level 3 investment comprising 5% of total plan assets as of december 31, 2022. the investment, a buy-in annuity contract, is valued based on the estimated cost to enter an equivalent contract at the balance sheet date.
to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates, we model our actual claims cost data over a five-year historical period, including an analysis of pre-65 versus post-65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population. this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends. 2020 experience was adjusted to remove the estimated impact of covid-19 claims. no adjustments were made to 2021 or 2022 claims. our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short-term future trends. kellogg's 5-year average claims inflation has been in the vicinity of 5.00% in recent years. our initial trend rate for 2023 of 6.00% reflects the recognition of increased short-term inflation and the health care provisions of the inflation reduction act. our initial rate remains flat for three years before trending downward by 0.50% per year, until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5% is reached. the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the year in which they occur. the experience gain arising from recognition of 2022 claims experience was approximately $14 million.
assumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize. in 2019, the society of actuaries (soa) published updated mortality tables and an updated improvement scale. in 2021, the soa released an improvement scale that incorporated an additional year of data. in 2022, the soa did not release an updated improvement scale. in determining the appropriate mortality assumptions as of 2022 fiscal year-end, we used the 2019 soa tables with collar adjustments based on kellogg's current population, consistent with the prior year. in addition, our assumption for future mortality improvement continues to be based on mortality information available from the social security administration and other sources, consistent with the prior year and in line with our expectations for future experience. there were no changes to the year-end pension and postretirement benefit obligations due to mortality assumption changes.
to conduct our annual review of discount rates, we selected the discount rate based on a cash-flow matching analysis using willis towers watson's proprietary rate:link tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans. rate:link establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments, as is generated by discounting each year's benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year. the spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of u.s. high quality bonds. a similar methodology is applied in canada and europe, and in the united kingdom the underlying yield curve was derived after further adjustments to the universe of bonds to remove government backed bonds. we use a december 31 measurement date for our defined benefit plans. accordingly, we select yield curves to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year.
based on consolidated obligations at december 31, 2022, a 25 basis point decline in the yield curve used for benefit plan measurement purposes would decrease 2023 benefits expense by approximately $3 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of $111 million. all obligation-related actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur.
despite the previously-described policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions, we periodically experience material actuarial gains or losses due to differences between assumed and actual experience and due to changing economic conditions. during 2022, we recognized a net actuarial loss of approximately $414 million compared to a net actuarial gain of approximately $166 million in 2021. the total net loss recognized in 2022 was driven by a loss of approximately $1.9 billion from lower than expected asset returns and a loss of approximately $108 million from plan experience, partially offset by an approximate $1.6 billion gain from assumption changes, including increases in the discount rate.
during 2022, we made contributions in the amount of $3 million to kellogg's global tax-qualified pension programs. this amount was mostly non-discretionary. additionally, we contributed $20 million to our retiree medical programs.
income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. the calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment.
we recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. for tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, new or emerging legislation and tax planning. the tax position will be de-recognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note 13 within notes to consolidated financial statements.
management monitors the company's ability to utilize certain future tax deductions, operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, prior to expiration as well as the reinvestment assertion regarding our undistributed foreign earnings. changes resulting from management's assessment will result in impacts to deferred tax assets and the corresponding impacts on the effective income tax rate. valuation allowances were recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized in the future.
future outlook the company issued its initial financial guidance for 2023. the company is projecting:
•organic net sales growth of 5-7%, driven by price/mix growth and led by sustained momentum in snacks and emerging markets.
•adjusted operating profit growth of 7-9% on a currency-neutral basis as margins stabilize amidst persistent cost inflation.
•adjusted earnings per share decline of (2)-(4)% on a currency-neutral basis which includes a an approximate (7)% impact from the remeasurement of pension and postretirement plans, reflecting last year's sharp decline in financial markets, and it is also impacted by a significant increase in interest expense due to higher interest rates.
•net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $1.7-1.8 billion, with capital expenditure of about $0.7 billion including capital expenditure related to the pending separation. as a result, cash flow is expected to be $1.0-1.1 billion. this is below 2022 levels due solely to approximately $0.3 billion of up-front charges and capital expenditure related to the company's pending separation, without which cash flow would be higher year on year.
for simplicity reasons, this guidance assumes the north america cereal business will remain in kellogg company for the full year, even though the plan is to spin it off before year end.
reconciliation of non-gaap guidance measures we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential full-year financial impact of mark-to-market adjustments because these impacts are dependent on future changes in market conditions (interest rates, return on assets, and commodity prices). similarly, because of volatility in foreign exchange rates and shifts in country mix of our international earnings, we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential full-year financial impact of foreign currency translation.
as a result, these impacts are not included in the guidance provided. therefore, we are unable to provide a full reconciliation of these non-gaap measures used in our guidance without unreasonable effort as certain information necessary to calculate such measure on a gaap basis is unavailable, dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the company.
see the table below that outlines the projected impact of certain other items that are excluded from non-gaap guidance for 2023:

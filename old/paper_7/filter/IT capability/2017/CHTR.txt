item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
reference is made to "part i. item 1a. risk factors" and "cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements," which describe important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and non-historical information contained herein. in addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto of charter included in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
overview we are the second largest cable operator in the united states and a leading broadband communications services company providing video, internet and voice services to approximately 27.2 million residential and business customers at december 31, 2017. in addition, we sell video and online advertising inventory to local, regional and national advertising customers and fiber-delivered communications and managed it solutions to large enterprise customers. we also own and operate regional sports networks and local sports, news and community channels and sell security and home management services in the residential marketplace. see "part i. item 1. business - products and services" for further description of these services, including customer statistics for different services.
in the first half of 2017, we completed the roll-out of spp to legacy twc and legacy bright house markets simplifying our offers and improving our packaging of products, allowing us to deliver more value to new and existing customers. as of december 31, 2017, approximately 60% of our residential customers are in an spp package. in the second half of 2017, we began converting the remaining legacy twc and legacy bright house analog markets to an all-digital platform enabling us to deliver more hd channels and higher internet speeds. the bulk of this all-digital initiative will take place in 2018. our corporate organization, as well as our marketing, sales and product development departments, are centralized. field operations are managed through eleven regional areas, each designed to represent a combination of designated marketing areas. in 2017, we began migrating legacy twc and legacy bright house customer care centers to legacy charter's model of using virtualized, u.s.-based in-house call centers. we are focused on deploying superior products and service with minimal service disruptions as we integrate our information technology and network operations. we intend to continue to insource the legacy twc and legacy bright house workforces in our call centers and in our field operations which we expect to lead to lower customer churn and longer customer lifetimes.
our integration activities will continue in 2018 with the expectation that by 2019 we will have substantially integrated the practices and systems of legacy charter, legacy twc and legacy bright house. in 2018, we will also launch our mobile product. as a result of growth costs for a new product line and implementing our operating strategy across legacy twc and legacy bright house, we cannot be certain that we will be able to grow revenues or maintain our margins at recent historical rates.
the company realized revenue, adjusted ebitda and income from operations during the periods presented as follows (in millions; all percentages are calculated using whole numbers. minor differences may exist due to rounding).
adjusted ebitda               $15,301               $10,592                $3,406                44.5         %          211.0         %
adjusted ebitda               $15,301               $14,464               $13,004                 5.8         %           11.2         %
(a)   income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2016 has been reduced from what was previously reported by $899 million to reflect the adoption of pension accounting guidance, and on a pro forma basis, income from operations for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 have been reduced from what was previously reported by $915 million and $73 million, respectively. for more information, see note 22 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
adjusted ebitda is defined as consolidated net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on financial instruments, net, other pension benefits, other (income) expense, net and other operating (income) expenses, such as merger and restructuring costs, special charges and gain (loss) on sale or retirement of assets. see "-use of adjusted ebitda and free cash flow" for further information on adjusted ebitda and free cash flow.
growth in total revenue, adjusted ebitda and income from operations was primarily due to the transactions. on a pro forma basis, assuming the transactions occurred as of january 1, 2015, total revenue growth was primarily due to growth in our internet and commercial businesses. revenue growth during 2017 was offset by lower advertising sales revenue due to a decrease in political and local advertising and an early contract termination benefit at legacy twc and legacy bright house in 2016. in addition to the items noted above, adjusted ebitda growth on a pro forma basis was affected by increases in programming costs and, in 2017, offset by decreases in costs to service customers and other operating costs and expenses. income from operations on a pro forma basis was additionally affected by increases in depreciation and amortization as well as changes in merger and restructuring costs.
approximately 91%, 90% and 91% of our revenues for years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our video, internet, voice and commercial services provided by our cable systems. generally, these customer subscriptions may be discontinued by the customer at any time subject to a fee for certain commercial customers. the remaining 9%, 10% and 9% of revenue for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is derived primarily from advertising revenues, franchise and other regulatory fee revenues (which are collected by us but then paid to local authorities), vod and pay-per-view programming, installation, processing fees or reconnection fees charged to customers to commence or reinstate service, revenue from regional sports and news channels and commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping services.
we incurred the following transition costs in connection with the transactions (in millions).
capital expenditures          $489                $460                $115
amounts included in transition operating expenses and transition capital expenditures represent incremental costs incurred to integrate the legacy twc and legacy bright house operations and to bring the three companies' systems and processes into a uniform operating structure.  costs are incremental and would not be incurred absent the integration.  other operating expenses associated with the transactions represent merger and restructuring costs and include advisory, legal and accounting fees, employee retention costs, employee termination costs and other exit costs.  interest expense associated with the transactions represents interest incurred on the cco safari ii, cco safari iii and ccoh safari notes issued in advance of the closing of the transactions, the proceeds of which were held in escrow to finance the transactions.
critical accounting policies and estimates certain of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments. management has discussed these policies with the audit committee of charter's board of directors, and the audit committee has reviewed the following disclosure. we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the estimates, assumptions and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements, and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows:
•   capitalization of labor and overhead costs
•   litigation
•   pension plans in addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimates or judgment that are not deemed critical, such as the allowance for doubtful accounts and valuations of our financial instruments, but changes in estimates or judgment in these other items could also have a material impact on our financial statements.
property, plant and equipment the cable industry is capital intensive, and a large portion of our resources are spent on capital activities associated with extending, rebuilding, and upgrading our cable network. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the net carrying amount of our property, plant and equipment (consisting primarily of cable distribution systems) was approximately $33.9 billion (representing 23% of total assets) and $33.0 billion (representing 22% of total assets), respectively. total capital expenditures for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $8.7 billion, $5.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.
capitalization of labor and overhead costs. costs associated with network construction or upgrades, initial placement of the customer drop to the dwelling and the initial placement of outlets within a dwelling along with the costs associated with the initial deployment of customer premise equipment necessary to provide video, internet or voice services, are capitalized.  costs capitalized include materials, direct labor and certain indirect costs. these indirect costs are associated with the activities of personnel who assist in installation activities, and consist of compensation and overhead costs associated with these support functions.  while our capitalization is based on specific activities, once capitalized, we track these costs on a composite basis by fixed asset category at the cable system level, and not on a specific asset basis.  for assets that are sold or retired, we remove the estimated applicable cost and accumulated depreciation.  the costs of disconnecting service and removing customer premise equipment from a dwelling and the costs to reconnect a customer drop or to redeploy previously installed customer premise equipment are charged to operating expense as incurred. costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred, while plant and equipment replacement, including replacement of certain components, betterments, and replacement of cable drops and outlets, are capitalized.
we make judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be capitalized. we capitalize direct labor and overhead using standards developed from actual costs and applicable operational data. we calculate standards annually (or more frequently if circumstances dictate) for items such as the labor rates, overhead rates, and the actual amount of time required to perform a capitalizable activity. for example, the standard amounts of time required to perform capitalizable activities are based on studies of the time required to perform such activities. overhead rates are established based on an analysis of the nature of costs incurred
in support of capitalizable activities, and a determination of the portion of costs that is directly attributable to capitalizable activities. the impact of changes that resulted from these studies were not material in the periods presented.
labor costs directly associated with capital projects are capitalized. capitalizable activities performed in connection with installations include such activities as:
•   verification of serviceability to the customer's dwelling or business (i.e., determining whether the customer's dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network);
•   customer premise activities performed by in-house field technicians and third-party contractors in connection with the installation, replacement and betterment of equipment and materials to enable video, internet or voice services; and
•   verifying the integrity of the customer's network connection by initiating test signals downstream from the headend to the customer premise equipment, as well as testing signal levels at the utility pole or pedestal.
judgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead costs incurred result from specific capital activities, and therefore should be capitalized. the primary costs that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are (i) employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct labor, (ii) direct variable costs associated with capitalizable activities, (iii) the cost of support personnel, such as care personnel and dispatchers, who assist with capitalizable installation activities, and (iv) indirect costs directly attributable to capitalizable activities.
while we believe our existing capitalization policies are appropriate, a significant change in the nature or extent of our system activities could affect management's judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future. we monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policies, and perform updates to our internal studies on an ongoing basis to determine whether facts or circumstances warrant a change to our capitalization policies. we capitalized direct labor and overhead of $1.7 billion, $991 million and $420 million, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
valuation and impairment of property, plant and equipment. we evaluate the recoverability of our property, plant and equipment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. such events or changes in circumstances could include such factors as the impairment of our indefinite life assets, changes in technological advances, fluctuations in the fair value of such assets, adverse changes in relationships with local franchise authorities, adverse changes in market conditions, or a deterioration of current or expected future operating results. a long-lived asset is deemed impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset. no impairments of long-lived assets to be held and used were recorded in the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
we utilize the cost approach as the primary method used to establish fair value for our property, plant and equipment in connection with business combinations.  the cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing a new asset with similar utility, then adjusts the value in consideration of physical depreciation and functional and economic obsolescence as of the valuation date. the cost approach relies on management's assumptions regarding current material and labor costs required to rebuild and repurchase significant components of our property, plant and equipment along with assumptions regarding the age and estimated remaining useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.
depreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment totaled $7.8 billion, $5.0 billion and $1.9 billion for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing approximately 21%, 19% and 21% of costs and expenses, respectively. depreciation is recorded using the straight-line composite method over management's estimate of the useful lives of the related assets as listed below:
cable distribution systems                      8-20 years customer premise equipment and installations     3-8 years vehicles and equipment                           4-9 years buildings and improvements                     15-40 years furniture, fixtures and equipment               7-10 years intangible assets valuation and impairment of franchises. the net carrying value of franchises as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $67.3 billion (representing 46% of total assets) and $67.3 billion (representing 45% of total assets), respectively. for more information and a complete discussion of how we value and test franchise assets for impairment, see note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
we perform an impairment assessment of franchise assets annually or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances. we performed a qualitative assessment in 2017. our assessment included consideration of a fair value appraisal performed for tax purposes in the beginning of 2017 as of a december 31, 2016 valuation date (the "appraisal") along with a multitude of factors that affect the fair value of our franchise assets. examples of such factors include environmental and competitive changes within our operating footprint, actual and projected operating performance, the consistency of our operating margins, equity and debt market trends, including changes in our market capitalization, and changes in our regulatory and political landscape, among other factors. based on our assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our franchise assets equals or exceeds their carrying values and that a quantitative impairment test is not required.
the appraisal indicated that the fair value of our franchise assets exceeded carrying value by more than 40% in the aggregate. at our unit of accounting level for franchise asset impairment testing, the amount by which fair value exceeded carrying value varied based on the extent to which the unit of accounting was comprised of operations acquired in 2016. for units of accounting comprised entirely or substantially of newly-acquired operations, the appraisal fair value exceeded carrying value by a range of 16% to 46% due to the recency of the transactions, while fair value for units of accounting comprised of at least 25% legacy charter operations, exceeded carrying value by a range of 29% to 264%.
valuation and impairment of goodwill. the net carrying value of goodwill as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $29.6 billion (representing 20% of total assets) and $29.5 billion (representing 20% of total assets), respectively. for more information and a complete discussion on how we test goodwill for impairment, see note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data." we perform our impairment assessment of goodwill annually as of november 30. as with our franchise impairment testing, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill in 2017 which included the fair value appraisal and other factors described above. based on the appraisal, we determined that the fair value of our goodwill exceeded carrying value by approximately 53%. given the completion of the assessment and absence of significant adverse changes in factors impacting our fair value estimates, we concluded that it is more likely than not that our goodwill is not impaired.
valuation, impairment and amortization of customer relationships. the net carrying value of customer relationships as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $12.0 billion (representing 8% of total assets) and $14.6 billion (representing 10% of total assets), respectively. amortization expense related to customer relationships for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $2.7 billion, $1.9 billion and $249 million, respectively. no impairment of customer relationships was recorded in the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. for more information and a complete discussion on our valuation methodology and amortization method, see note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
income taxes as of december 31, 2017, charter had approximately $10.9 billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset of approximately $2.3 billion. these losses resulted from the operations of charter holdco and its subsidiaries and from loss carryforwards received as a result of the twc transaction. federal tax net operating loss carryforwards
expire in the years 2018 through 2035. in addition, as of december 31, 2017, charter had state tax net operating loss carryforwards, resulting in a gross deferred tax asset (net of federal tax benefit) of approximately $359 million. state tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the years 2018 through 2037.  such tax loss carryforwards can accumulate and be used to offset charter's future taxable income. as of december 31, 2017, all of charter's federal tax loss carryforwards are subject to section 382 and other restrictions. pursuant to these restrictions, charter estimates that approximately $8.7 billion in 2018, $654 million in 2019 and an additional $226 million annually over each of the next five years of federal tax loss carryforwards, should become unrestricted and available for charter's use. an additional $415 million is currently subject to a valuation allowance. charter's state tax loss carryforwards are subject to similar but varying restrictions.
income tax benefit for the year ended december 31, 2017 was recognized primarily as a result of the enactment of the tax cuts & jobs act ("tax reform") in december 2017. among other things, the primary provisions of tax reform impacting us are the reductions to the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and temporary 100% bonus depreciation for certain assets. the change in tax law required us to remeasure existing net deferred tax liabilities using the lower rate in the period of enactment resulting in an income tax benefit of approximately $9.3 billion to reflect these changes in the year ended december 31, 2017. we have reported provisional amounts for the income tax effects of tax reform for which the accounting is incomplete but a reasonable estimate could be determined. there were no specific impacts of tax reform that could not be reasonably estimated which we accounted for under prior tax law. based on a continued analysis of the estimates and further guidance on the application of the law, it is anticipated that additional revisions may occur throughout the allowable measurement period. overall, the changes due to tax reform will favorably affect income tax expense on future u.s. earnings.
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management takes into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. due to legacy charter's history of losses, legacy charter was historically unable to assume future taxable income in its analysis and accordingly valuation allowances were established against the deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, from definite-lived assets for book accounting purposes. however, as a result of the twc transaction in 2016, deferred tax liabilities resulting from the acquisition accounting increased significantly and future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities are recognized, is sufficient to conclude it is more likely than not that we will realize substantially all of our deferred tax assets. as a result, in 2016 charter reversed approximately $3.3 billion of its valuation allowance and recognized a corresponding income tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31, 2016. approximately $87 million of valuation allowance associated with federal tax net operating loss carryforwards and approximately $50 million of valuation allowance associated with state tax loss carryforwards and other miscellaneous deferred tax assets remains on the december 31, 2017 consolidated balance sheet.
in determining our tax provision for financial reporting purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless such positions are determined to be "more likely than not" of being sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits. in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements. the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved. there is considerable judgment involved in determining whether positions taken on the tax return are "more likely than not" of being sustained. we adjust our uncertain tax reserve estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations.
no tax years for charter, charter holdings or charter holdco for income tax purposes, are currently under examination by the irs. charter and charter holdings' 2016 and 2017 tax years remain open for examination and assessment. legacy charter's tax years ending 2014 through the short period return dated may 17, 2016 remain subject to examination and assessment. years prior to 2014 remain open solely for purposes of examination of legacy charter's loss and credit carryforwards. the irs is currently examining legacy twc's income tax returns for 2011 through 2014. legacy twc's tax year 2015 remains subject to examination and assessment. prior to legacy twc's separation from time warner inc. ("time warner") in march 2009 (the "separation"), legacy twc was included in the consolidated u.s. federal and certain state income tax returns of time warner. the irs is currently examining time warner's 2008 through 2010 income tax returns. time warner's income tax returns for 2005 to 2007, which are periods prior to the separation, were settled with the exception of an immaterial item that has been referred to the irs appeals division. we do not anticipate that these examinations will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. in addition, we are also subject to ongoing examinations of our tax returns by state and local tax authorities for various periods. activity related to these state and local examinations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations during the year ended december 31, 2017, nor do we anticipate a material impact in the future.
litigation legal contingencies have a high degree of uncertainty. when a loss from a contingency becomes estimable and probable, a reserve is established. the reserve reflects management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised as facts and circumstances change. a reserve is released when a matter is ultimately brought to closure or the statute of limitations lapses. we have established reserves for certain matters. although these matters are not expected individually to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, such matters could have, in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
programming agreements we exercise judgment in estimating programming expense associated with certain video programming contracts. our policy is to record video programming costs based on the substance of our contractual agreements with our programming vendors, which are generally multi-year agreements that provide for us to make payments to the programming vendors at agreed upon market rates based on the number of customers to which we provide the programming service. if a programming contract expires prior to the parties' entry into a new agreement and we continue to distribute the service, we estimate the programming costs during the period there is no contract in place. in doing so, we consider the previous contractual rates, inflation and the status of the negotiations in determining our estimates. when the programming contract terms are finalized, an adjustment to programming expense is recorded, if necessary, to reflect the terms of the new contract. we also make estimates in the recognition of programming expense related to other items including the allocation of consideration exchanged between the parties among the various items in multiple-element transactions.
judgment is also involved when we enter into agreements that result in us receiving cash consideration from the programming vendor, usually in the form of advertising sales, channel positioning fees, launch support or marketing support. in these situations, we must determine based upon facts and circumstances if such cash consideration should be recorded as revenue, a reduction in programming expense or a reduction in another expense category (e.g., marketing).
pension plans we sponsor two qualified defined benefit pension plans, the twc pension plan and the twc union pension plan (collectively, the "twc pension plans"), that provide pension benefits to a majority of legacy twc employees. we also provide a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain employees under the twc excess pension plan. as of december 31, 2017, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the twc pension plans was $3.6 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, and the net underfunded liability of the twc pension plans was recorded as a $1 million noncurrent asset, $5 million current liability and $292 million long-term liability. as of december 31, 2016, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the twc pension plans was $3.3 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, and the net underfunded liability of the twc pension plans was recorded as a $1 million noncurrent asset, $6 million current liability and $309 million long-term liability.
pension benefits are based on formulas that reflect the employees' years of service and compensation during their employment period. actuarial gains or losses are changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from changes in assumptions. we have elected to follow a mark-to-market pension accounting policy for recording the actuarial gains or losses annually during the fourth quarter, or earlier if a remeasurement event occurs during an interim period. we use a december 31 measurement date for our pension plans.
we recognized net periodic pension benefits of $1 million and $813 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. net periodic pension benefit or expense is determined using certain assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate and mortality assumptions. we determined the discount rate used to compute pension expense based on the yield of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds with cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future defined benefit payments. in developing the expected long-term rate of return on assets, we considered the current pension portfolio's composition, past average rate of earnings, and our asset allocation targets. we used a discount rate of 4.20% from january 1, 2017 to september 30, 2017 and 3.88% from october 1, 2017 to december 31, 2017 to compute 2017 pension expense. a decrease in the discount rate of 25 basis points would result in a $173 million increase in our pension plan benefit obligation as of december 31, 2017 and net periodic pension expense recognized in 2017 under our mark-to-market accounting policy. our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to compute 2017 pension expense was 6.50%. a decrease in the expected long-term rate of return of 25 basis points, from 6.50% to 6.25%, while holding all other assumptions constant, would result in an increase in our 2018 net periodic pension expense of approximately $8 million. see note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" for additional discussion on these assumptions.

revenues.  total revenues grew $12.6 billion or 43.4% in the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 and grew $19.2 billion or 197.3% in the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to 2015. revenue growth primarily reflects the transactions and increases in the number of residential internet and commercial business customers, price adjustments as well as growth in expanded basic video penetration offset by a decrease in limited basic video customers. the transactions increased revenues for the years ended 2017 and 2016 as compared to the corresponding prior periods by approximately $11.4 billion and $18.6 billion, respectively. on a pro forma basis, assuming the transactions occurred as of january 1, 2015, total revenue growth was 3.9% and 7.0% for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 as compared to the corresponding prior periods.
video revenues consist primarily of revenues from basic and digital video services provided to our residential customers, as well as franchise fees, equipment and video installation revenue. residential video customers decreased by 292,000 in 2017 and, excluding the impacts of the transactions, increased by 42,000 in 2016. the increases in video revenues are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):
advertising sales revenues consist primarily of revenues from commercial advertising customers, programmers and other vendors, as well as local cable and advertising on regional sports and news channels. advertising sales revenues increased in 2017 and 2016 primarily due to the transactions. the transactions increased advertising sales revenues for the years ended 2017 and 2016 as compared to the corresponding prior periods by $425 million and $898 million, respectively. on a pro forma basis, assuming the transactions occurred as of january 1, 2015, advertising sales revenues decreased $186 million and increased $172 million during the years ended 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior periods primarily due to political advertising.

programming costs consist primarily of costs paid to programmers for basic, digital, premium, vod, and pay-per-view programming. the increase in programming costs on a pro forma basis, assuming the transactions occurred as of january 1, 2015, is primarily a result of contractual rate adjustments, including renewals and increases in amounts paid for retransmission consents, higher expanded basic video package customers and higher pay-per-view events offset by synergies as a result of the transactions.  we expect programming expenses will continue to increase due to a variety of factors, including annual increases imposed by programmers with additional selling power as a result of media consolidation, increased demands by owners of broadcast stations for payment for retransmission consent or linking carriage of other services to retransmission consent, and additional programming, particularly new services. we have been unable to fully pass these increases on to our customers nor do we expect to be able to do so in the future without a potential loss of customers.
costs to service customers decreased $144 million during 2017 as compared to 2016, on a pro forma basis, assuming the transactions occurred as of january 1, 2015, primarily due to benefits from combining legacy twc and legacy bright house into charter, including lower employee benefit and maintenance costs, higher labor and material capitalization with increases in placement of new customer equipment and improved productivity.
the increase in corporate costs during 2016 as compared to 2015 relates primarily to increases in the number of employees including increases in engineering and it. the increase in advertising sales expense relates primarily to higher advertising sales revenue. stock compensation expense increased during 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to increases in headcount and the value of equity issued.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization expense increased by $3.7 billion and $4.8 billion in 2017 and 2016 as compared to the corresponding prior periods primarily as a result of additional depreciation and amortization related to the transactions, inclusive of the incremental amounts as a result of the higher fair values recorded in acquisition accounting and, in 2017, higher capital expenditures.
the changes in merger and restructuring costs is primarily due to approximately $262 million of contingent financing and advisory transaction fees paid at the closing of the transactions in 2016 as well as approximately $279 million and $611 million of employee retention and employee termination costs incurred during 2017 and 2016, respectively. for more information, see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
interest expense, net.  net interest expense increased by $591 million in 2017 from 2016 and by $1.2 billion in 2016 from 2015. the increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily due to an increase in weighted average debt outstanding of $11.7 billion primarily as a result of the issuance of notes in 2017 for general corporate purposes including stock buybacks. interest expense associated with debt assumed from legacy twc also increased interest expense during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the corresponding period in 2016 by approximately $336 million. the increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily due to an increase of $463 million of interest expense associated with the debt incurred to fund the transactions and $604 million associated with debt assumed from legacy twc.
loss on extinguishment of debt. loss on extinguishment of debt of $40 million, $111 million and $128 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 primarily represents losses recognized as a result of the repurchase of cco holdings notes and amendments to charter operating's credit facilities. for more information, see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
gain (loss) on financial instruments, net. gains and losses on financial instruments are recognized due to changes in the fair value of our interest rate and our cross currency derivative instruments, and the foreign currency remeasurement of the fixed-rate british pound sterling denominated notes (the "sterling notes") into u.s. dollars. for more information, see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
other pension benefits. other pension benefits decreased by $898 million during 2017 compared to 2016 and increased $899 million during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the pension curtailment gain of $675 million and remeasurement gain of $195 million recognized in 2016 as opposed to remeasurement losses of $55 million recognized in 2017. for more information, see note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
other expense, net. other expense, net primarily represents equity losses on our equity-method investments. for more information, see note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
income tax benefit. we recognized income tax benefit of $9.1 billion, $2.9 billion and $60 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31, 2017 was recognized primarily through the enactment of tax reform which resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately $9.3 billion as well as by approximately $88 million due to the recognition of excess tax benefits resulting from share based compensation as a component of the provision for income taxes following the prospective application of accounting guidance related to employee-share based payments (see note 22 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.").
income tax benefit for the year ended december 31, 2016 was the result of a reduction of substantially all of legacy charter's preexisting valuation allowance associated with its deferred tax assets of approximately $3.3 billion as certain of the deferred tax liabilities that were assumed in connection with the closing of the twc transaction will reverse and provide a source of future taxable income.
the income tax benefit in 2015 was primarily due to the deemed liquidation of charter holdco solely for federal and state income tax purposes, resulting in a $187 million deferred income tax benefit offset by income tax expense primarily through increases in deferred tax liabilities. for more information, see note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for financial reporting purposes represents a/n's portion of charter holdings' net income based on its effective common unit ownership interest of approximately 10% and on the preferred dividend of $150 million and $93 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. for more information, see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
use of adjusted ebitda and free cash flow we use certain measures that are not defined by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") to evaluate various aspects of our business. adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are non-gaap financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, consolidated net income (loss) and net cash flows from operating activities reported in accordance with gaap. these terms, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are reconciled to consolidated net income (loss) and net cash flows from operating activities, respectively, below.
adjusted ebitda eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of our businesses as well as other non-cash or special items, and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. however, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and our cash cost of financing. these costs are evaluated through other financial measures.
free cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures.
management and charter's board of directors use adjusted ebitda and free cash flow to assess our performance and our ability to service our debt, fund operations and make additional investments with internally generated funds. in addition, adjusted ebitda generally correlates to the leverage ratio calculation under our credit facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the facilities and notes (all such documents have been previously filed with the sec). for the purpose of calculating compliance with leverage covenants, we use adjusted ebitda, as presented, excluding certain expenses paid by our operating subsidiaries to other charter entities. our debt covenants refer to these expenses as management fees, which fees were in the amount of $1.1 billion, $930 million and $322 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

liquidity and capital resources overview we have significant amounts of debt.  the principal amount of our debt as of december 31, 2017 was $69.0 billion, consisting of $9.5 billion of credit facility debt, $40.6 billion of investment grade senior secured notes and $18.9 billion of high-yield senior unsecured notes. our business requires significant cash to fund principal and interest payments on our debt.
our projected cash needs and projected sources of liquidity depend upon, among other things, our actual results, and the timing and amount of our expenditures. as we launch our new mobile services, we expect an initial funding period to grow a new product as well as negative working capital impacts from the timing of device-related cash flows when we provide the handset or tablet to customers pursuant to equipment installment plans. free cash flow was $4.1 billion, $3.3 billion and $547 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. as of december 31, 2017, the amount available under our credit facilities was approximately $3.6 billion and cash on hand was approximately $621 million. we expect to utilize free cash flow, cash on hand and availability under our credit facilities as well as future refinancing transactions to further extend the maturities of our obligations. the timing and terms of any refinancing transactions will be subject to market conditions among other considerations. additionally, we may, from time to time, and depending on market conditions and other factors, use cash on hand and the proceeds from securities offerings or other borrowings to retire our debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, tender offers or redemption provisions. we believe we have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand, free cash flow and charter operating's revolving credit facility as well as access to the capital markets to fund our projected cash needs.
we continue to evaluate the deployment of our cash on hand and anticipated future free cash flow including to invest in our business growth and other strategic opportunities, including mergers and acquisitions as well as stock repurchases and dividends. our target leverage remains at 4 to 4.5 times, and up to 3.5 times at the charter operating level. our leverage ratio was 4.5 as of december 31, 2017. we may increase the total amount of our indebtedness to maintain leverage within our target leverage range. during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, we purchased approximately 33.4 million and 5.1 million shares, respectively, of charter class a common stock for approximately $11.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. as of december 31, 2017, charter had remaining board authority to purchase an additional $1.1 billion of charter's class a common stock and/or charter holdings common units. charter is not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the timing of any purchases that may occur cannot be predicted and will largely depend on market conditions and other potential uses of capital. purchases may include open market purchases, tender offers or negotiated transactions.
as possible acquisitions, swaps or dispositions arise, we actively review them against our objectives including, among other considerations, improving the operational efficiency, clustering, product development or technology capabilities of our business and achieving appropriate return targets, and we may participate to the extent we believe these possibilities present attractive opportunities. however, there can be no assurance that we will actually complete any acquisitions, dispositions or system swaps, or that any such transactions will be material to our operations or results.
in december 2016, charter and a/n entered into a letter agreement (the "letter agreement") that requires a/n to sell to charter or to charter holdings, on a monthly basis, a number of shares of charter class a common stock or charter holdings common units that represents a pro rata participation by a/n and its affiliates in any repurchases of shares of charter class a common stock from persons other than a/n effected by charter during the immediately preceding calendar month, at a purchase price equal to
the average price paid by charter for the shares repurchased from persons other than a/n during such immediately preceding calendar month. a/n and charter both have the right to terminate or suspend the pro rata repurchase arrangement on a prospective basis once charter or charter holdings have repurchased shares of class a common stock or charter holdings common units from a/n and its affiliates for an aggregate purchase price of $537 million, which threshold has been met. on december 21, 2017, charter and a/n entered into an amendment to the letter agreement resetting the aggregate purchase price to $400 million. charter holdings purchased from a/n 4.8 million and 0.8 million charter holdings common units at an average price per unit of $347.03 and $289.83, or $1.7 billion and $218 million during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

(a)   the table presents maturities of long-term debt outstanding as of december 31, 2017. refer to notes 9 and 20 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" for a description of our long-term debt and other contractual obligations and commitments.
(c)   we lease certain facilities and equipment under noncancelable capital and operating leases. capital lease obligations represented $123 million of total capital and operating lease obligations as of december 31, 2017. leases and rental costs charged to expense for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, were $321 million, $215 million and $49 million, respectively.
minimum payments. the table sets forth the aggregate guaranteed minimum commitments under our programming contracts.
(e)   "other" represents other guaranteed minimum commitments, including rights negotiated directly with content owners for distribution on company-owned channels or networks, commitments related to our role as an advertising and distribution sales agent for third party-owned channels or networks, commitments to our customer premise equipment vendors and contractual obligations related to third-party network augmentation.
the following items are not included in the contractual obligations table because the obligations are not fixed and/or determinable due to various factors discussed below. however, we incur these costs as part of our operations:
•   we rent utility poles used in our operations. generally, pole rentals are cancelable on short notice, but we anticipate that such rentals will recur. rent expense incurred for pole rental attachments for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $167 million, $115 million and $53 million, respectively.
•   we have $291 million in letters of credit, of which $137 million is secured under the charter operating credit facility, primarily to our various casualty carriers as collateral for reimbursement of workers' compensation, auto liability and general liability claims.
•   minimum pension funding requirements have not been presented in the table above as such amounts have not been determined beyond 2017. we made no cash contributions to the qualified pension plans in 2017; however, we are permitted to make discretionary cash contributions to the qualified pension plans in 2018. for the nonqualified pension plan, we contributed $18 million during 2017 and will continue to make contributions in 2018 to the extent benefits are paid.
see "part i. item 1. business - transaction-related commitments" for a listing of commitments as a result of the transactions.
historical operating, investing, and financing activities cash and cash equivalents. we held $621 million and $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
operating activities.  net cash provided by operating activities increased $3.9 billion during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in adjusted ebitda of $4.7 billion offset by an increase in cash paid for interest, net of $761 million as a result of the transactions and long-term debt issued for general corporate purposes including stock buybacks.
net cash provided by operating activities increased $5.7 billion during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in adjusted ebitda of $7.2 billion offset by an increase in cash paid for interest, net of $1.6 billion primarily as a result of the transactions.
investing activities. net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, was $8.1 billion, $11.3 billion and $17.0 billion, respectively. the changes in cash used were primarily due to the acquisition of legacy twc and legacy bright house in 2016 as well as increases in capital expenditures as a result of the transactions.
financing activities. net cash used in financing activities increased $9.5 billion during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to increases in the purchase of treasury stock and noncontrolling interest as well as a decrease in equity issued offset by an increase in borrowings of long-term debt exceeding repayments.
net cash provided in financing activities decreased $9.9 billion during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in borrowings of long-term debt exceeding repayments as well as increases in the purchase of treasury stock and noncontrolling interest offset by an increase in equity issued for the acquisition of legacy twc and legacy bright house in 2016.
capital expenditures we have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements.  capital expenditures were $8.7 billion, $5.3 billion and $1.8 billion for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  the increase was driven by the transactions. on a pro forma basis, assuming the transactions occurred as of january 1, 2015, the increase during 2017 as compared to 2016 was driven
by higher cpe purchases for spp, our all-digital initiative and early inventory purchases to operationally stage 2018 activity, higher support capital investments and line extensions. see the table below for more details.
the actual amount of our capital expenditures in 2018 will depend on a number of factors, including our all-digital transition in the legacy twc and legacy bright house markets, further spend related to product development and growth rates of both our residential and commercial businesses.
our capital expenditures are funded primarily from cash flows from operating activities and borrowings on our credit facility. in addition, our accrued liabilities related to capital expenditures increased by $820 million, $603 million and $28 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
the following tables present our major capital expenditures categories on an actual and pro forma basis, assuming the transactions occurred as of january 1, 2015, in accordance with national cable and telecommunications association ("ncta") disclosure guidelines for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. the disclosure is intended to provide more consistency in the reporting of capital expenditures among peer companies in the cable industry. these disclosure guidelines are not required disclosures under gaap, nor do they impact our accounting for capital expenditures under gaap (dollars in millions):

(a)   the accreted values presented in the table above represent the principal amount of the debt less the original issue discount at the time of sale, deferred financing costs, and, in regards to the legacy twc debt assumed, fair value premium adjustments as a result of applying acquisition accounting plus the accretion of those amounts to the balance sheet date. however, the amount that is currently payable if the debt becomes immediately due is equal to the principal amount of the debt. in regards to the sterling notes, the principal amount of the debt and any premium or discount is remeasured into us dollars as of each balance sheet date. we have availability under our credit facilities of approximately $3.6 billion as of december 31, 2017.
(b)   in general, the obligors have the right to redeem all of the notes set forth in the above table in whole or in part at their option, beginning at various times prior to their stated maturity dates, subject to certain conditions, upon the payment of the outstanding principal amount (plus a specified redemption premium) and all accrued and unpaid interest.
see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" for further details regarding our outstanding debt and other financing arrangements, including certain information about maturities, covenants and restrictions related to such debt and financing arrangements. the agreements and instruments governing our debt and financing arrangements are complicated and you should consult such agreements and instruments which are filed with the sec for more detailed information.
at december 31, 2017, charter operating had a consolidated leverage ratio of approximately 3.0 to 1.0 and a consolidated first lien leverage ratio of 2.9 to 1.0. both ratios are in compliance with the ratios required by the charter operating credit facilities of 5.0 to 1.0 consolidated leverage ratio and 4.0 to 1.0 consolidated first lien leverage ratio. a failure by charter operating to maintain the financial covenants would result in an event of default under the charter operating credit facilities and the debt of cco holdings. see "part i. item 1a. risk factors - the agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity."

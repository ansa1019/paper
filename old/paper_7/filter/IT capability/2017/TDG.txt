item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with "selected financial data" and td group's consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. the following discussion may contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed under the heading entitled "risk factors" included elsewhere in this report. these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below.
overview for fiscal year 2017, we generated net sales of $3,504.3 million, gross profit of $1,984.6 million or 56.6% of sales, and net income of $596.9 million. we believe we have achieved steady, long-term growth in sales and improvements in operating performance since our formation in 1993 due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our value-driven operating strategy. more specifically, focusing our businesses on our value-driven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business, carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered value-added products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long term.
our selective acquisition strategy has also contributed to the growth of our business. the integration of certain acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements of the financial performance of the acquired business.
we believe our key competitive strengths include:
large and growing installed product base with aftermarket revenue stream. we provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products. we estimate that our products are installed on approximately 95,000 commercial transport, regional transport, military and general aviation fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft.
diversified revenue base. we believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product, platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance. our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms now in production. we expect to continue to develop new products for military and commercial applications.
barriers to entry. we believe that the niche nature of our markets, the industry's stringent regulatory and certification requirements, the large number of products that we sell and the investments necessary to develop and certify products create potential disincentives to competition for certain products.
our business strategy is made up of two key elements: (1) a value-driven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and (2) a selective acquisition strategy.
•   obtaining profitable new business. we attempt to obtain profitable new business by using our technical expertise and application skill and our detailed knowledge of our customer base and the individual niche markets in which we operate. we have regularly been successful in identifying and developing both aftermarket and oem products to drive our growth.
•   improving our cost structure. we are committed to maintaining and continuously improving our lean cost structure through detailed attention to the cost of each of the products that we offer and our organizational structure, with a focus on reducing the cost of each.
selective acquisition strategy. we selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core value-driven operating strategies. the aerospace industry, in particular, remains highly fragmented, with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small non-core operations of larger businesses. we have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture. as of the date of this report, we have successfully acquired approximately 60 businesses and/or product lines since our formation in 1993. many of these acquisitions have been integrated into an existing transdigm production facility, which enables a higher production capacity utilization, which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production volume.
acquisitions during the previous three fiscal years are more fully described in note 2, "acquisitions," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap, which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods. management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations. however, investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods, assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions.
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. for additional accounting policies, see note 3, "summary of significant accounting policies," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.
revenue recognition and related allowances: revenue is recognized from the sale of products when title and risk of loss passes to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment. substantially all product sales are made pursuant to firm, fixed-price purchase orders received from customers. collectibility of amounts recorded as revenue is reasonably assured at the time of sale. provisions for returns, uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified, as appropriate, by the most current information available. we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of such allowances; however, due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material.
allowance for doubtful accounts: management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness. the allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers. management's estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified credit losses and estimated credit losses based on historical information. the determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management. depending on the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues, or if the financial condition of any of the company's customers were to deteriorate and their ability to make required payments were to become impaired, increases in these allowances may be required. historically, changes in estimates in the allowance for doubtful accounts have not been significant.
inventories: inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. cost of inventories is generally determined by the average cost and the first-in, first-out (fifo) methods and includes material, labor and overhead related to the manufacturing process. because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be in-service for 25 or more years, it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use. where management estimated that the current market value was below cost or determined that future demand was lower than current inventory levels, based on historical experience, current and projected market demand, current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions, a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value was made by recording a provision included in cost of sales. although management believes that the company's estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future. in addition, in accordance with industry practice, all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales, even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year. historically, changes in estimates in the net realizable value of inventories have not been significant.
goodwill and other intangible assets: in accordance with asc 805, "business combinations," the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill. the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. in addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts, the company used a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including third-party appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets. fair value adjustments to the company's assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition.
intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed or exchanged, regardless of the company's intent to do so. goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates.
gaap requires that the annual, and any interim, impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level. the reporting unit level is one level below an operating segment. substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each reporting
unit pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction. with respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing reporting unit, any acquired goodwill is combined with the goodwill of the reporting unit.
at the time of goodwill impairment testing, the company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. the quantitative test is required only if the company concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if the company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit. for the quantitative test, management determines the estimated fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit. if the calculated estimated fair value is less than the current carrying value, impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit may exist. the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing. the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing includes discount rates, growth rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital ("wacc") methodology. the wacc methodology considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used. the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business.
management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates, sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low long-term growth rates. as an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model, the aggregate of all reporting unit's estimated fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the company.
the company had 34 reporting units with goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the date of the last annual impairment test. the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective carrying values, and therefore, no goodwill impairment was recorded. the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, which is a significant assumption in the calculation of fair values. with a one percentage point increase in the discount rate, nearly all of the reporting units would continue to have fair values substantially in excess of their respective carrying values.
management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level, as determined by appropriate asset valuation at the time of acquisition. the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison between the estimated fair values and carrying values. if the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their estimated fair values, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference. management utilizes the royalty savings valuation method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset. in this method, management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset. the key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the wacc methodology considering any differences in company-specific risk factors between reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets. royalty rates are established by management with the advice of valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts. management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant intangible asset. terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low long-term growth rates.
the discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed. actual results could differ from these assumptions. management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions.
stock-based compensation: the cost of the company's stock-based compensation is recorded in accordance with asc 718, "stock compensation." the company uses a black-scholes-merton option pricing model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the stock options awarded. the black-scholes-merton model requires assumptions regarding the expected volatility of the company's common shares, the risk-free interest rate, the expected life of the stock options award and the company's dividend yield. the company utilizes historical data in determining these assumptions. an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management's control could have an impact on the black-scholes-merton model.
income taxes: the company estimates income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates. this involves estimating taxable earnings, specific taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits. to the extent these estimates change, adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes are made in the period in which the changes occur. historically, such adjustments have not been significant.
fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 compared with fiscal year ended september 30, 2016
total company net sales. net organic sales and acquisition sales and the related dollar and percentage changes for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (amounts in millions):
acquisition sales             255.7                 -                          255.7                           8.1           %
acquisition sales represent sales of acquired businesses for the period up to one year subsequent to their acquisition date. the amount of acquisition sales shown in the table above was attributable to the third quarter 2017 acquisitions in fiscal year 2017 and the acquisitions of y&f/tactair, ddc and breeze-eastern in fiscal year 2016.
cost of sales and gross profit. cost of sales increased by $76.4 million, or 5.3%, to $1,519.7 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 compared to $1,443.3 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016. cost of sales and the related percentage of total sales for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (amounts in millions):
acquisition integration costs                           4.0                             8.3                     (4.3    )        (51.8     )%
gross profit                                       $1,984.6                        $1,728.1                   $256.5              14.8      %
gross profit percentage                                56.6        %                   54.5        %             2.1    %
the increase in the dollar amount of cost of sales during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 was primarily due to increased volume associated with the sales from acquisitions and organic sales growth.
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased by 2.1 percentage points to 56.6% for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 from 54.5% for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016. the dollar amount of gross profit increased by $256.5 million, or 14.8%, for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 compared to the comparable period last year due to the following items:
•   gross profit on the sales from the acquisitions indicated above (excluding acquisition-related costs) was approximately $153.6 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017, which represented gross profit of approximately 60% of the acquisition sales. the higher gross profit margin on the acquisition sales increased gross profit as a percentage of consolidated sales by approximately 1 percentage point.
•   organic sales growth described above, application of our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving our cost structure, and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers), and positive leverage on our fixed overhead costs spread over a higher production volume, resulted in a net increase in gross profit of approximately $94.4 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017.
•   gross profit was also improved by the reduction of the impact of inventory purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition integration costs and stock compensation expense charged to cost of sales of approximately $8.5 million.
acquisition-related expenses                                            6.5                            26.0              (19.5    )        (75.0     )%
the increase in the dollar amount of selling and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 is primarily due to higher selling and administrative expenses relating to recent acquisitions of approximately $47.7 million, which was approximately 19% of acquisition sales. the increase is partially offset by lower acquisition-related and stock compensation expenses of $19.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively.
amortization of intangible assets. amortization of intangible assets increased to $89.2 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 from $77.4 million for the comparable period last year. the net increase of $11.8 million was primarily due to the third quarter 2017 acquisitions and full year amortization recorded from the fiscal 2016 acquisitions of breeze-eastern, ddc and y&f/tactair.
refinancing costs. refinancing costs of $39.8 million were recorded during the year ended september 30, 2017 representing debt issuance costs expensed in connection with the debt financing activity as disclosed in note 11, "debt," to the consolidated financial statements. included within the $39.8 million was approximately $31.9 million in debt issuance costs and premium related to the repurchase of the 2021 notes. refinancing costs of $15.8 million were recorded during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 representing debt issuance costs expensed in connection with the debt financing activity in june 2016.
interest expense-net. interest expense-net includes interest on borrowings outstanding, amortization of debt issuance costs, original issue discount and premium, and revolving credit facility fees offset by interest income. interest expense-net increased $118.7 million, or 24.5%, to $602.6 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 from $483.9 million for the comparable period last year. the net increase in interest expense-net was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average level of outstanding borrowings, which was approximately $10,993 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 and approximately $8,834 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016. the weighted average cash interest rate was consistent at 5.3% during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017 and 2016. the increase in weighted average level of borrowings was due to the issuance of the 2026 notes for $950 million in june 2016, the incremental term loans of $950 million in june 2016, the additional net debt financing of $641 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2017, the additional 2025 notes offering of $300 million in the second fiscal
quarter of 2017, the additional $100 million drawn on the trade receivable securitization facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and the additional net debt financing of $575 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. the weighted average interest rate for cash interest payments on total borrowings outstanding at september 30, 2017 was 5.2%.
income taxes. income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately 24.9% for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 compared to 23.7% for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016. the company's effective tax rate for these periods was less than the federal statutory tax rate due primarily to excess tax benefits on equity compensation, foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the u.s. statutory rates, and the domestic manufacturing deduction. the increase in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 was primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at higher rates versus the prior year foreign earnings.
loss from discontinued operations. loss from discontinued operations is comprised of the operating loss from the schroth operations that were classified as held-for-sale as of september 30, 2017. the loss includes a $32 million impairment charge to write-down schroth's assets to fair value. more detailed information can be found in note 22, "discontinued operations."
organic sales for the power & control segment increased $70.8 million, or an increase of 4.3%, when compared to the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016. the organic sales increase resulted from increases in commercial aftermarket sales ($40.9 million, an increase of 7.5%), defense sales ($28.2 million, an increase of 4.4%), and commercial oem sales ($1.0 million, an increase of 0.3%). acquisition sales for the power & control segment totaled $255.7 million, or an increase of 15.8%, resulting from the third quarter 2017 acquisitions and the acquisitions of y&f/tactair, ddc and breeze-eastern in fiscal year 2016.
organic sales for the airframe segment decreased $5.8 million, or a decrease of 0.4%, when compared to the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016. the organic sales decrease primarily resulted from decreases in commercial aftermarket sales ($6.1 million, a decrease of 1.0%), commercial oem sales ($5.3 million, a decrease of 1.1%) and non-aerospace sales ($6.9 million, a decrease of 39.4%) offset by an increase in defense sales ($12.5 million, an increase of 4.2%). there was no impact from acquisitions in the results of the airframe segment.
organic sales for the non-aviation segment increased $12.2 million, or an increase of 12.0%, when compared to the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016. the sales increase was primarily due to an increase in non-aerospace sales of $9.9 million, an increase of 11.5%. there was no impact from acquisitions in the results of the non-aviation segment.
ebitda as defined. ebitda as defined by segment for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (amounts in millions):
organic ebitda as defined for the power & control segment increased approximately $82.7 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016. ebitda as defined from the third quarter 2017 acquisitions and the acquisitions of y&f/tactair, ddc and breeze-eastern in fiscal year 2016 was approximately $110.9 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017.
organic ebitda as defined for the airframe segment increased approximately $16.7 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016. there was no impact from acquisitions in the results of the airframe segment.
organic ebitda as defined for the non-aviation segment increased approximately $13.3 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016. there was no impact from acquisitions in the results of the non-aviation segment.
fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 compared with fiscal year ended september 30, 2015
total company net sales. net organic sales and acquisition sales and the related dollar and percentage changes for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (amounts in millions):
acquisition sales             409.2                 -                          409.2                          15.1           %
acquisition sales represent sales of acquired businesses for the period up to one year subsequent to their acquisition date. the amount of acquisition sales shown in the table above was attributable to the acquisitions of breeze-eastern and ddc in fiscal year 2016 and and the acquisitions of pneudraulics, pexco aerospace, adams rite aerospace gmbh and telair cargo group in fiscal year 2015.
cost of sales and gross profit. cost of sales increased by $186.0 million, or 14.8%, to $1,443.3 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 compared to $1,257.3 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2015. cost of sales and the related percentage of total sales for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (amounts in millions):
cost of sales-excluding acquisition-related costs below          $1,405.6                        $1,235.1                   $170.5             13.8      %
acquisition integration costs                                         8.3                             6.1                      2.2             36.1      %
gross profit                                                     $1,728.1                        $1,449.8                   $278.3             19.2      %
gross profit percentage                                              54.5        %                   53.6        %             0.9    %
the increase in the dollar amount of cost of sales during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 was primarily due to increased volume associated with the sales from acquisitions and organic sales growth.
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased by 0.9 percentage points to 54.5% for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 from 53.6% for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2015. the dollar amount of gross profit increased by $278.3 million, or 19.2%, for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 compared to the comparable period last year due to the following items:
•   gross profit on the sales from the acquisitions indicated above (excluding acquisition-related costs) was approximately $171.2 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016, which represented gross profit of approximately 42% of the acquisition sales. the lower gross profit margin on the acquisition sales reduced gross profit as a percentage of consolidated sales by approximately 2 percentage points.
•   organic sales growth described above, application of our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving our cost structure, and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers), and positive leverage on our fixed overhead costs spread over a higher production volume, resulted in a net increase in gross profit of approximately $122.6 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016.
•   slightly offsetting the increases in gross profit was the impact of higher inventory purchase accounting adjustments acquisition integration costs and stock compensation expense charged to cost of sales of approximately $15.5 million.
acquisition-related expenses                                           26.0                            18.7                    7.3             39.0      %
the increase in the dollar amount of selling and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 is primarily due to higher selling and administrative expenses relating to recent acquisitions of approximately $44.8 million, which
was approximately 11% of acquisition sales, and higher acquisition-related and stock compensation expenses of $7.3 million and $15.6 million, respectively.
amortization of intangible assets. amortization of intangible assets decreased to $77.4 million for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 from $54.2 million for the comparable period last year. the net increase of $23.2 million was primarily due to the acquisitions of breeze-eastern and ddc in fiscal 2016 and full year amortization recorded on the acquisitions made in 2015.

backlog for information about our backlog, see item 1. - "business."
foreign operations our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately $1,318.9 million, $1,169.5 million, and $881.1 million for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks, including foreign currency fluctuations, the impact of foreign government regulations, political uncertainties and differences in business practices. there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments' countries. furthermore, there can be no assurance that the political, cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy.
inflation many of the company's raw materials and operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of inflation, which could result in changing operating costs. the effects of inflation on the company's businesses during the fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 were immaterial.
liquidity and capital resources we have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing. we vary our leverage both to optimize our equity return and to pursue acquisitions. we expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations and/or through refinancing in the debt markets prior to the maturity dates of our debt.
we continually evaluate our debt facilities to assess whether they most efficiently and effectively meet the current and future needs of our business. the company evaluates from time to time the appropriateness of its current leverage, taking into consideration the company's debt holders, equity holders, credit ratings, acquisition opportunities and other factors. the company's debt leverage ratio, which is computed as total debt divided by ebitda as defined for the applicable twelve-month period, has varied widely during the company's history, ranging from approximately 3.5 to 7.2. our debt leverage ratio at september 30, 2017 was approximately 6.9.
if the company has excess cash, it generally prioritizes allocating the excess cash in the following manner: (1) capital spending at existing businesses, (2) acquisitions of businesses, (3) payment of a special dividend and/or repurchases of our common stock and (4) prepayment of indebtedness or repurchase of debt. whether the company undertakes additional common stock repurchases or other aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions, the company's liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. the amounts involved may be material. in addition, the company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so.
the company's ability to make scheduled interest payments on, or to refinance, the company's indebtedness, or to fund non-acquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts, will depend on the company's ability to generate cash in the future. this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control.
as a result of the additional debt financing during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017, interest payments will increase going forward in accordance with the terms of the related debt agreements. however, in connection with the continued application of our three core value-driven operating strategies (obtaining profitable new business, continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers), we expect our efforts will continue to generate strong margins and provide more than sufficient cash from operating activities to meet our interest obligations and liquidity needs.  we believe our cash from operations and available borrowing capacity will enable us to make opportunistic investments in our own stock, make strategic business combinations and/or pay dividends to our shareholders.
in the future, the company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions, if cash flow from operating activities becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other short-term cash needs or for stock repurchases or dividends. our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets.
operating activities. the company generated $788.7 million of net cash from operating activities during fiscal 2017 compared to $683.3 million during fiscal 2016, a net increase of $105.4 million. the net increase is primarily attributable to an increase in income from continuing operations and items adjusting net income for non-cash expenses and income of $38.8 million, and favorable changes in trade accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable of $28.9 million, net.
the change in inventories was a source of cash of $5.1 million in fiscal 2017 compared to a use of cash of $2.1 million in fiscal 2016, which is attributable to increased monitoring of inventory management.
the company generated $683.3 million of net cash from operating activities during fiscal 2016 compared to $520.9 million during fiscal 2015. the net increase of $162.4 million was due primarily to an increase in income from continuing operations.

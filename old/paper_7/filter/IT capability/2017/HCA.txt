2017 operations summary net income attributable to hca healthcare, inc. totaled $2.216 billion, or $5.95 per diluted share, for 2017, compared to $2.890 billion, or $7.30 per diluted share, for 2016. the 2017 results include additional expenses and losses of revenues estimated at approximately $140 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, associated with the impact of hurricanes harvey and irma on our texas, florida, georgia and south carolina facilities and an increase in provision for income taxes of $301 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the enactment of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act. the amount associated with the hurricanes is prior to any insurance recoveries which we may receive. the 2017 results also include net gains on sales of facilities of $8 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, and losses on retirement of debt of $39 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. the 2016 results include net gains on sales of facilities of $23 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, losses on retirement of debt of $4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, and legal claim benefits of $246 million, or $0.39 per diluted share. our provisions for income taxes for 2017 and 2016 included tax benefits of $82 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, and $162 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, respectively, related to employee equity award settlements. our provision for income taxes for 2016 also included tax benefits of $51 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, primarily related to the resolution of federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years. all per diluted share disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. shares used for diluted earnings per share were 372.221 million shares and 395.851 million shares for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. during 2017 and 2016, we repurchased 25.092 million and 36.325 million shares, respectively, of our common stock.
revenues increased to $43.614 billion for 2017 from $41.490 billion for 2016. revenues increased 5.1% and 3.8%, respectively, on a consolidated basis and on a same facility basis for 2017, compared to 2016. the consolidated revenues increase can be attributed to the combined impact of a 2.1% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 3.0% increase in equivalent admissions. the same facility revenues increase resulted from a 2.2% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.5% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.
during 2017, consolidated admissions increased 2.4% and same facility admissions increased 1.1%, compared to 2016. inpatient surgical volumes increased 1.7% on a consolidated basis and increased 0.3% on a same facility basis during 2017, compared to 2016. outpatient surgical volumes increased 0.3% on a consolidated basis and declined 1.3% on a same facility basis during 2017, compared to 2016. emergency room visits increased 2.9% on a consolidated basis and increased 1.4% on a same facility basis during 2017, compared to 2016.
for 2017, the provision for doubtful accounts increased $782 million, compared to 2016. the self-pay revenue deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts increased $710 million and $1.473 billion, respectively, for 2017, compared to 2016. the sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  (continued)
and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, was 34.9% for 2017, compared to 33.0% for 2016. same facility uninsured admissions increased 5.9% and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 2.4% for 2017, compared to 2016. same facility uninsured admissions increased 3.8% and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 4.5% for 2016, compared to 2015.
cash flows from operating activities declined $227 million, from $5.653 billion for 2016 to $5.426 billion for 2017. the decline in cash flows from operating activities was primarily related to the net impact of the decline of net income of $689 million, offset by positive changes related to depreciation and amortization of $165 million and income taxes of $310 million.
business strategy we are committed to providing the communities we serve with high quality, cost-effective health care while growing our business, increasing our profitability and creating long-term value for our stockholders. to achieve these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda:
grow our presence in existing markets. we believe we are well positioned in a number of large and growing markets that will allow us the opportunity to generate long-term, attractive growth through the expansion of our presence in these markets. we plan to continue recruiting and strategically collaborating with the physician community and adding attractive service lines such as cardiology, emergency services, oncology and womens services. additional components of our growth strategy include expanding our footprint through developing various outpatient access points, including surgery centers, urgent care clinics, freestanding emergency care facilities and walk-in clinics.
achieve industry-leading performance in clinical and satisfaction measures. achieving high levels of patient safety, patient satisfaction and clinical quality are central goals of our business model. to achieve these goals, we have implemented a number of initiatives including infection reduction initiatives, hospitalist programs, advanced health information technology and evidence-based medicine programs. we routinely analyze operational practices from our best-performing hospitals to identify ways to implement organization-wide performance improvements and reduce clinical variation. we believe these initiatives will continue to improve patient care, help us achieve cost efficiencies, grow our revenues and favorably position us in an environment where our constituents are increasingly focused on quality, efficacy and efficiency.
recruit and employ physicians to meet the needs for high quality health services. we depend on the quality and dedication of the health care providers and other team members who serve at our facilities. we believe a critical component of our growth strategy is our ability to successfully recruit and strategically collaborate with physicians and other professionals to provide high quality care. we attract and retain physicians by providing high quality, convenient facilities with advanced technology, by expanding our specialty services and by building our outpatient operations. we believe our continued investment in the employment, recruitment and retention of physicians will improve the quality of care at our facilities.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
continue to leverage our scale and market positions to enhance profitability. we believe there is significant opportunity to continue to grow the profitability of our company by fully leveraging the scale and scope of our franchise. we are currently investing in initiatives such as additional care navigators, clinical data exchange and centralized patient transfer operations, which will enable us to improve coordination of care and patient retention across our markets. we believe our centrally managed business processes and ability to leverage cost-saving practices across our extensive network will enable us to continue to manage costs effectively. we continue to invest in our parallon subsidiary group to leverage key components of our support infrastructure, including revenue cycle management, health care group purchasing, supply chain management and staffing functions.
pursue a disciplined development strategy. we continue to believe there are significant growth opportunities in our markets. we will continue to provide financial and operational resources to analyze and develop our in-market opportunities. to complement our in-market growth agenda, we intend to focus on selectively developing and acquiring new hospitals, outpatient facilities and other health care service providers. we believe the challenges faced by the hospital industry may continue to spur consolidation and we believe our size, scale, national presence and access to capital will position us well to participate in any such consolidation. we have a strong record of successfully acquiring and integrating hospitals and entering into joint ventures and intend to continue leveraging this experience.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known. actual results may differ from these estimates.
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenues revenues are recorded during the period the health care services are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from payers. estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. the estimated reimbursement amounts are made on a payer-specific basis and are recorded based on the best information available regarding managements interpretation of the applicable laws, regulations and contract terms. management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals. we have invested significant resources to refine and improve our billing systems and the information system data used to make contractual allowance estimates. we have developed standardized calculation processes and related employee training programs to improve the utility of our patient accounting systems.
the emergency medical treatment and labor act (emtala) requires any hospital participating in the medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
critical accounting policies and estimates (continued)
hospitals emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. the obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individuals ability to pay for treatment. federal and state laws and regulations, including but not limited to emtala, require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care encourages, the provision of services to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive.
we do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, these amounts are not reported in revenues. we provide discounts from our gross charges to uninsured amounts related to patients who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care. after the discounts are applied, we are still unable to collect a significant portion of uninsured patients accounts, and we record significant provisions for doubtful accounts (based upon our historical collection experience) related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided.
due to the complexities involved in the classification and documentation of health care services authorized and provided, the estimation of revenues earned and the related reimbursement are often subject to interpretations that could result in payments that are different from our estimates. adjustments to estimated medicare and medicaid reimbursement amounts and disproportionate-share funds, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during the respective year were $41 million, $31 million and $48 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during previous years were $56 million, $90 million and $85 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we expect adjustments during the next 12 months related to medicare and medicaid cost report filings and settlements will result in increases to revenues generally similar to the amounts recorded during these years.
provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts the collection of outstanding receivables from medicare, medicaid, managed care payers, other third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. the primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. the provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts. accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been performed. our collection policies include a review of all accounts against certain standard collection criteria, upon completion of our primary internal collection efforts. accounts determined to possess positive collectibility attributes are forwarded to a secondary internal or external collection agency and the other accounts are written off. the accounts that are not collected by the secondary collection agency are written off when secondary collection efforts are completed (usually within 12 months). writeoffs are based upon specific identification and the writeoff process requires a writeoff adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. we do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care.
the amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon managements assessment of historical writeoffs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state, and private

critical accounting policies and estimates (continued)
employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and recoveries at facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and accounts receivable (the hindsight analysis) as a primary source of information in estimating the collectibility of our accounts receivable. we perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. we believe our quarterly updates to the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable valuations of our accounts receivable. these routine, quarterly changes in estimates have not resulted in material adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts, provision for doubtful accounts or period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, the allowance for doubtful accounts represented 100% of the $5.488 billion and 98% of the $5.116 billion, respectively, patient due accounts receivable balance. the patient due accounts receivable balance represents the estimated uninsured portion of our accounts receivable. the estimated uninsured portion of medicaid pending and uninsured discount pending accounts is included in our patient due accounts receivable balance.
to quantify the total impact of and trends related to uninsured accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view the revenue deductions related to uninsured accounts (charity care and uninsured discounts) and provision for doubtful accounts in combination, rather than each separately. a summary of these amounts for the years ended december 31, follows (dollars in millions):
charity care                                $4,861             $4,151             $3,682
patient care costs (salaries and benefits, supplies, other operating expenses and depreciation         $37,557             $35,304             $33,760
the sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care was 34.9% for 2017, 33.0% for 2016 and 31.5% for 2015. days revenues in accounts receivable were 52 days, 50 days and 53 days at december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. management expects a continuation of the challenges related to the collection of the patient due accounts. adverse changes in the percentage of our patients having adequate health care coverage, increases in patient responsibility amounts under certain health care coverages, general

economic conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer mix, or trends in federal, state, and private employer health care coverage could affect the collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations.
professional liability claims we, along with virtually all health care providers, operate in an environment with professional liability risks. our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence, subject to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. the insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of $25 million per occurrence. we purchase excess insurance on a claims-made basis for losses in excess of $50 million per occurrence. provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $466 million, $430 million and $344 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
reserves for professional liability risks represent the estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. the estimated ultimate cost includes estimates of direct expenses and fees paid to outside counsel and experts, but does not include the general overhead costs of our insurance subsidiary or corporate office. individual case reserves are established based upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimates of the future costs that will be paid on reported claims. case reserves are reduced as claim payments are made and are adjusted upward or downward as our estimates regarding the amounts of future losses are revised. once the case reserves for known claims are determined, information is stratified by loss layers and retentions, accident years, reported years, and geographic location of our hospitals. several actuarial methods are employed to utilize this data to produce estimates of ultimate losses and reserves for incurred but not reported claims, including: paid and incurred extrapolation methods utilizing paid and incurred loss development to estimate ultimate losses; frequency and severity methods utilizing paid and incurred claims development to estimate ultimate average frequency (number

critical accounting policies and estimates (continued)
professional liability claims (continued)
of claims) and ultimate average severity (cost per claim); and bornhuetter-ferguson methods which add expected development to actual paid or incurred experience to estimate ultimate losses. these methods use our company-specific historical claims data and other information. company-specific claim reporting and payment data collected over an approximate 20-year period is used in our reserve estimation process. this company-specific data includes information regarding our business, including historical paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, historical and current case loss reserves, actual and projected hospital statistical data, professional liability retentions for each policy year, geographic information and other data.
reserves and provisions for professional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. the estimated reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under reinsurance contracts, were $1.456 billion to $1.743 billion at december 31, 2017 and $1.358 billion to $1.625 billion at december 31, 2016. our estimated reserves for professional liability claims may change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends. we perform sensitivity analyses which model the volatility of key actuarial assumptions and monitor our reserves for adequacy relative to all our assumptions in the aggregate. based on our analysis, we believe the estimated professional liability reserve ranges represent the reasonably likely outcomes for ultimate losses. we consider the number and severity of claims to be the most significant assumptions in estimating reserves for professional liabilities. a 2.5% change in the expected frequency trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $30 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $29 million. a 2.5% change in the expected claim severity trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $106 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $98 million. we believe adequate reserves have been recorded for our professional liability claims; however, due to the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to resolve the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes, our ultimate liability for professional liability claims could change by more than the estimated sensitivity amounts and could change materially from our current estimates.
the reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately 2,500 and 2,700 individual claims at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and estimates for unreported potential claims. the time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated. the average time period between the occurrence and final resolution for our professional liability claims is approximately four years, although the facts and circumstances of each individual claim can result in an occurrence-to-resolution timeframe that varies from this average. the estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly.
reserves for professional liability risks were $1.627 billion and $1.539 billion at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the current portion of these reserves, $429 million and $391 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, is included in other accrued expenses. obligations covered by reinsurance and excess insurance contracts are included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not meet their obligations. reserves for professional liability risks (net of $24 million and $45 million receivable under reinsurance and excess insurance contracts at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively) were $1.603 billion and $1.494 billion at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the estimated total net reserves for professional liability risks at december 31, 2017 and 2016 are comprised of $751 million and $830 million, respectively, of case reserves for known claims and $852 million and $664 million, respectively, of reserves for incurred but not reported claims.

professional liability claims (continued)
changes in our professional liability reserves, net of reinsurance recoverable, for the years ended december 31, are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):
net reserves for professional liability claims, january 1                   $1,494              $1,421          $1,382
net reserves for professional liability claims, december 31                 $1,603              $1,494          $1,421
income taxes we calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences that arise from the recognition of items in different periods for tax and accounting purposes. deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effects of amounts expensed in our income statement for which tax deductions will be claimed in future periods.
although we believe we have properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws, federal, state or foreign taxing authorities may challenge our tax positions upon audit. significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of uncertain tax positions. we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our income tax returns. during each reporting period, we assess the facts and circumstances related to uncertain tax positions. if the realization of unrecognized tax benefits is deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances, the estimated liability and the provision for income taxes are reduced in the current period. final audit results may vary from our estimates.
results of operations revenue/volume trends our revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charge and negotiated payment rates for such services. gross charges typically do not reflect what our facilities are actually paid. our facilities have entered into agreements with third-party payers, including government programs and managed care health plans, under which the facilities are paid based upon the cost of providing services, predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or discounts from gross charges. we do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues. we provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
same facility revenues increased 3.8% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016 and increased 4.1% for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the 3.8% increase for 2017 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 2.2% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.5% increase in same facility equivalent admissions. the 4.1% increase for 2016 can be attributed to the combined impact of a 2.2% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.9% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.
consolidated admissions increased 2.4% during 2017 compared to 2016 and increased 1.2% during 2016 compared to 2015. consolidated surgeries increased 0.8% during 2017 compared to 2016 and increased 2.1% during 2016 compared to 2015. consolidated emergency room visits increased 2.9% during 2017 compared to 2016 and increased 4.1% during 2016 compared to 2015.
same facility admissions increased 1.1% during 2017 compared to 2016 and during 2016 compared to 2015. same facility surgeries declined 0.7% during 2017 compared to 2016 and increased 1.3% during 2016 compared to 2015. same facility emergency room visits increased 1.4% during 2017 compared to 2016 and increased 3.8% during 2016 compared to 2015.
same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 2.4% and same facility uninsured admissions increased 5.9% during 2017 compared to 2016. same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 4.5% and same facility uninsured admissions increased 3.8% during 2016 compared to 2015.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
at december 31, 2017, we owned and operated 45 hospitals and 32 surgery centers in the state of florida. our florida facilities revenues totaled $10.168 billion, $9.522 billion and $9.059 billion for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. at december 31, 2017, we owned and operated 46 hospitals and 27 surgery centers in the state of texas. our texas facilities revenues totaled $10.634 billion, $9.898 billion and $9.517 billion for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. during 2017, 2016 and 2015, 56% of our admissions and 48%, 47% and 47%, respectively, of our revenues were generated by our florida and texas facilities. uninsured admissions in florida and texas represented 70%, 69% and 68% of our uninsured admissions during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
we receive a significant portion of our revenues from government health programs, principally medicare and medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. in december 2017, the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) announced that it will phase out federal matching funds for designated state health programs under waivers granted under section 1115 of the social security act due to concerns that the funds were not used as an integral part of medicaid demonstrations focused on delivery system reform or coverage reform.
texas currently operates its healthcare transformation and quality improvement program pursuant to a medicaid waiver (the texas waiver program). in december 2017, cms approved an extension of this waiver through september 30, 2022, but indicated that it will phase out some of the federal funding. as currently structured, the texas waiver program includes two primary components: an uncompensated care component and a delivery system reform incentive payment (dsrip) component. initiatives under the dsrip program are designed to provide incentive payments to hospitals and other providers for their investments in delivery system reforms that increase access to health care, improve the quality of care and enhance the health of patients and families they serve. cms will provide level dsrip funding for two years, decreased funding for the following two years, and no dsrip funding beginning october 1, 2021. in addition, the disbursement methodology for uncompensated care pool funding will be revised to align with federal policies. beginning october 1, 2019, texas will not receive any federal financial participation for uncompensated care pool payments until cms approves revised uncompensated care protocol policies for the state that will govern how hospitals uncompensated care entitlement is calculated and the size of the statewide uncompensated care pool. based on the waiver renewal terms, we expect the statewide uncompensated care pool size will ultimately be reduced, but

it is presently unclear whether our share of the pool and its corresponding uncompensated care payments will increase or decrease. we provide charity care services directly to patients in several communities in the state of texas, in affiliation with other hospitals. as a result of additional charitable care being provided directly to patients by private hospitals, public hospital districts or counties in texas have available funds that were previously devoted to indigent care. the public hospital districts or counties are under no contractual or legal obligation to provide such indigent care. the public hospital districts or counties have elected to transfer some portion of these available funds to the states medicaid program. such action is at the sole discretion of the public hospital districts or counties. it is anticipated that these contributions to the state will be matched with federal medicaid funds, as they have been for the past twelve years in texas. the state then may make supplemental payments to hospitals in the state for medicaid services rendered. hospitals receiving medicaid supplemental payments may include those that are providing additional indigent care services.
in addition, we receive supplemental payments in several other states. we are aware these supplemental payment programs are currently being reviewed by certain state agencies and some states have made waiver requests to cms to replace their existing supplemental payment programs. it is possible these reviews and waiver requests will result in the restructuring of such supplemental payment programs and could result in the payment programs being reduced or eliminated. because deliberations about these programs are ongoing, we are unable to estimate the financial impact the program structure modifications, if any, may have on our results of operations.

during june 2017, we amended our senior secured revolving credit facilities by (i) increasing the commitments under the senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility to $3.750 billion, (ii) extending the maturity date of the revolving credit commitments to june 28, 2022, (iii) amending the incremental facility provisions to permit the incurrence of additional incremental credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion and (iv) providing that the commitment fee for unutilized commitments under the senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility shall be 0.250% per annum.

(a)                we have not included obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits of $439 million at december 31, 2017, as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of cash payments, if any, at this time.
(c)                              the estimation of the timing of payments for professional liability claims beyond a year can vary significantly. the time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated.
(d)                   amounts relate to future operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other obligations and are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. amounts also include physician commitments that are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet.
(e)                amounts relate primarily to instances in which we have agreed to indemnify various commercial insurers and lenders who have provided surety bonds and letters of credit to cover utility and construction deposits and medicaid provider bonds.
(f)                                                                     in consideration for physicians relocating to the communities in which our hospitals are located and agreeing to engage in private practice for the benefit of the respective communities, we make advances to physicians, normally over a period of one year, to assist in establishing the physicians practices. the actual amount of these commitments to be advanced often depends upon the financial results of the physicians private practice during the recruitment agreement payment period. the physician commitments reflected were based on our maximum exposure on effective agreements at december 31, 2017.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. the investments in our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries were $472 million at december 31, 2017. these investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. at december 31, 2017, we had a net unrealized gain of $10 million on the insurance subsidiaries investment securities.
we are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. investments in debt and equity securities of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. should the 100% owned insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairments on our investment securities in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue-specific factors.
we are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. the notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities. our credit risk related to these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions. the interest payments under these agreements are settled on a net basis. these derivatives have been recognized in the financial statements at their respective fair values. changes in the fair value of these derivatives, which are designated as cash flow hedges, are included in other comprehensive income.
with respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, approximately $5.072 billion of long-term debt at december 31, 2017 was subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining balance in long-term debt of $27.986 billion at december 31, 2017 was subject to fixed rates of interest. both the general level of interest rates and, for the senior secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable interest rates. our variable debt is comprised primarily of amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities. borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (2) the prime rate of bank of america or (b) a libor rate for the currency of such borrowing for the relevant interest period. the applicable margin for borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities may fluctuate according to a leverage ratio. the average effective interest rate for our long-term debt declined from 5.5% for 2016 to 5.3% for 2017.
the estimated fair value of our total long-term debt was $34.689 billion at december 31, 2017. the estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities. based on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates, the potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would be approximately $51 million. to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, we generally target a majority of our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates.
we are exposed to currency translation risk related to our foreign operations. we currently do not consider the market risk related to foreign currency translation to be material to our consolidated financial statements or our liquidity.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
financial instruments derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks, including interest rate exposures, and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. we recognize derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically either in earnings or in stockholders equity, as a component of other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the hedged items when they occur.
effects of inflation and changing prices various federal, state and local laws have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices. revenues for general, acute care hospital services rendered to medicare patients are established under the federal governments prospective payment system. total fee-for-service medicare revenues were 21.7%, 21.4% and 21.8% of our revenues for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
management believes hospital industry operating margins have been, and may continue to be, under significant pressure because of changes in payer and service mix and growth in operating expenses in excess of the increase in prospective payments under the medicare program. in addition, as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures, our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to non-medicare patients is limited.
tax examinations during 2016, the irs completed its examination, resolving all outstanding federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years. we are subject to examination by the irs for tax years 2014 and later as well as by state and foreign taxing authorities.
management believes hca healthcare, inc., its predecessors and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the irs, state and foreign taxing authorities and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. however, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

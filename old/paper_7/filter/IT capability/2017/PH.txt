overview the company's order rates provide a near-term perspective of the company's outlook particularly when viewed in the context of prior and future order rates. the company publishes its order rates on a quarterly basis. the lead time between the time an order is received and revenue is realized generally ranges from one day to 12 weeks for mobile and industrial orders and from one day to 18 months for aerospace orders. the company believes the leading economic indicators of these markets that have a correlation to the company's future order rates are as follows:
•   purchasing managers index (pmi) on manufacturing activity specific to regions around the world with respect to most mobile and industrial markets;
•   global aircraft miles flown and global revenue passenger miles for commercial aerospace markets and department of defense spending for military aerospace markets; and
•   housing starts with respect to the north american residential air conditioning market and certain mobile construction markets.
a pmi above 50 indicates that the manufacturing activity specific to a region of the world in the mobile and industrial markets is expanding. a pmi below 50 indicates the opposite. recent pmi levels for some regions around the world were as follows:
united states                 57.8                  57.2                 52.8
global aircraft miles flown increased by approximately six percent and global revenue passenger miles increased approximately seven percent from their comparable 2016 levels. the company anticipates that u.s. department of defense spending with regards to appropriations, and operations and maintenance for the u.s. government's fiscal year 2017 will increase slightly from the comparable fiscal 2016 level.
the company believes many opportunities for growth are available. the company intends to focus primarily on business opportunities in the areas of energy, water, food, environment, defense, life sciences, infrastructure and transportation.
the company believes it can meet its strategic objectives by:
•   serving the customer and continuously enhancing its experience with the company;
•   successfully executing its win strategy initiatives relating to premier customer service, financial performance and profitable growth;
•   maintaining its decentralized division and sales company structure;
•   engineering innovative systems and products to provide superior customer value through improved service, efficiency and productivity;
•   creating a culture of empowerment through its values, inclusion and diversity, accountability and teamwork.
during 2017, the company completed three acquisitions, including the acquisition of clarcor which is further discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. acquisitions will be considered from time to time to the extent there is a strong strategic fit, while at the same time maintaining the company's strong financial position. the company will continue to assess its existing businesses and initiate efforts to divest businesses that are not considered to be a good long-term strategic fit for the company. future business divestitures could have a negative effect on the company's results of operations.
the discussion below is structured to separately discuss the financial statements presented in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. the term "year" and references to specific years refer to the applicable fiscal year.
gross profit margin                                                            23.6   %            22.3   %            24.0   %
net sales in 2017 were 5.9 percent higher than 2016. the increase in net sales in 2017 was primarily a result of acquisitions made in the last 12 months (which contributed approximately $558 million in sales in 2017) and an increase in volume in both the diversified industrial international operations and the aerospace systems segment, partially offset by the effect of currency rate changes (which decreased net sales in 2017 by approximately $84 million). net sales in 2016 were 10.6 percent lower than 2015. the decrease in net sales in 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in volume in both the diversified industrial north american and diversified industrial international operations and the effect of currency rate changes (which decreased net sales in 2016 by approximately $403 million), partially offset by sales from acquisitions (which contributed approximately $42 million in sales in 2016).
gross profit margin increased in 2017 primarily due to lower operating expenses resulting from the company's simplification initiative and other restructuring activities, primarily experienced in the diversified industrial segment, partially offset by lower margins in the aerospace systems segment and higher amortization expense in the diversified industrial segment. gross profit margin decreased in 2016 primarily due to both lower sales volume, resulting in manufacturing inefficiencies, and higher business realignment charges in the diversified industrial segment, partially offset by a favorable product mix and lower engineering costs in the aerospace systems segment. foreign currency transaction (gain) loss (relating to cash, marketable securities and other investments and intercompany transactions) included in cost of sales for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $8.1 million, $22.7 million and $(77.8) million, respectively. pension cost included in cost of sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $135.0 million, $172.4 million and $169.8 million, respectively. included in cost of sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were business realignment charges of $35.9 million, $76.2 million and $19.4 million, respectively.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7.0 percent in 2017 and decreased 12.0 percent in 2016. the increase in 2017 was primarily due to higher amortization expense resulting from current-year acquisitions and higher acquisition expenses partially offset by lower expenses resulting from the company's simplification initiative, lower expenses associated with the company's deferred compensation program and lower professional services expenses. the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower research and development expenses, lower incentive compensation expense and lower stock compensation expense, partially offset by higher business realignment charges. pension cost included in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $65.8 million, $74.4 million and $69.6 million, respectively. included in
other (income), net in 2017, 2016 and 2015 includes $42.4 million, $25.6 million and $23.2 million of income, respectively, related to the company's equity interests in joint ventures.
effective tax rate in 2017 was favorably impacted by an increase of discrete tax benefits, mostly related to stock-based compensation expense. the effective tax rate in 2016 was favorably impacted by an increase of discrete tax benefits, an increase in the u.s. research and development credit, and an increase in the u.s. foreign tax credit. these benefits were partially offset by an unfavorable geographic mix of earnings.
discussion of business segment information the business segment information presents sales, operating income and assets on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which the company's various businesses are managed for internal review and decision-making.
sales in 2017 for the diversified industrial north american operations increased 8.3 percent from 2016 compared to decreasing 13.3 percent between 2015 and 2016. acquisitions completed within the last 12 months contributed approximately $436 million in sales in 2017 and the effect of currency exchange rates decreased sales in 2017 by $17 million. excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2017 in the diversified industrial north american operations remained flat from 2016 reflecting higher demand from distributors being offset by lower demand from end-users in the heavy-duty truck, cars and light trucks, life sciences, and oil and gas markets. excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2016 in the diversified industrial north american operations decreased 12.4 percent from 2015 reflecting lower demand from distributors and end-users in most markets. the markets that experienced the largest decline in end-user demand were the oil and gas, construction equipment and farm and agriculture equipment markets.
sales in the diversified industrial international operations increased 5.6 percent in 2017 after a decrease of 12.6 percent from 2015 to 2016. acquisitions completed within the last 12 months contributed approximately $121 million in sales in 2017. the effect of currency rate changes decreased sales by $66 million, reflecting the strengthening of the u.s. dollar primarily against currencies in the united kingdom, the eurozone countries and china. excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2017 in the diversified industrial international operations increased 4.3 percent from 2016, primarily due to higher volume in the asia pacific region and latin america, partially offset by lower volume in europe. within the asia pacific region, higher demand was experienced from distributors as well as end-users in the semiconductor, cars and light
trucks, telecommunications, construction equipment and engine markets. within latin america, higher demand was experienced from distributors and end-user demand in the agriculture equipment market. within europe, higher demand from distributors and end-user demand in the construction equipment, forestry, and miscellaneous manufacturing markets was more than offset by lower end-user demand in the general industrial machinery, oil and gas, and marine markets. excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2016 in the diversified industrial international operations decreased 6.1 percent from 2015, primarily due to lower volume in all regions, with approximately 55 percent of the decrease occurring in europe and approximately 35 percent of the decrease occurring in the asia pacific region. within these regions, the largest decrease in sales was experienced from distributors and end-users in the oil and gas, marine, engine, and construction equipment markets.
the increase in operating margins in 2017 in the diversified industrial north american operations was primarily due to lower operating expenses resulting from the company's simplification initiative and other restructuring activities, resulting in manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by higher acquisition-related expenses and higher amortization expense. the increase in operating margins in 2017 in the diversified industrial international operations was primarily due to the higher sales volume, lower operating expenses resulting from restructuring activities and the company's simplification initiative, resulting in manufacturing efficiencies. the decrease in operating margins in 2016 in the diversified industrial north american operations was primarily due to the lower sales volume and higher business realignment charges, partially offset by lower operating expenses primarily resulting from the company's simplification initiative. the decrease in operating margins in 2016 in the diversified industrial international operations was primarily due to the lower sales volume, an unfavorable product mix and higher business realignment charges, partially offset by lower operating expenses primarily resulting from the company's simplification initiative and prior-year restructuring activities.
the business realignment charges consist primarily of severance costs related to actions taken under the company's simplification initiative implemented by operating units throughout the world as well as plant closures. the majority of the diversified industrial international business realignment charges were incurred in europe. in addition to the business realignment charges presented in the table above, the company recognized $12 million of expense associated with enhanced retirement benefits in connection with a plant closure during 2016. the company anticipates that cost savings realized from the work force reduction measures taken during 2017 will increase 2018 operating income by approximately three percent in the diversified industrial north american operations and by approximately four percent in the diversified industrial international operations. in 2018, the company expects to continue to take actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the diversified industrial segment, including the integration of 2017 acquisitions. such actions are expected to result in approximately $110 million in charges in 2018.
the company anticipates diversified industrial north american sales for 2018 will increase between 19 and 23 percent from the 2017 level and diversified industrial international sales for 2018 will increase between eight percent and 12 percent from the 2017 level. the primary driver for the increase in sales in 2018 in both the diversified industrial north american and diversified industrial international businesses is expected to be the sales contribution from 2017 acquisitions. diversified industrial north american operating margins in 2018 are expected to range from 16.1 percent to 16.5 percent and diversified industrial international margins are expected to range from 13.4 percent to 13.8 percent.
the increase in total diversified industrial segment backlog in 2017 was primarily due to current-year acquisitions as well as orders exceeding shipments in all regions, with north america and europe each accounting for approximately 40 percent of the increase. the decrease in total diversified industrial segment backlog in 2016 was primarily due to shipments exceeding orders primarily in north america and europe, with north america accounting for approximately 70 percent of the decrease and europe accounting for approximately 30 percent of the decrease. backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. the dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale.
the increase in total diversified industrial segment assets in 2017 was primarily due to current-year acquisitions, partially offset by the effect of currency rate fluctuations. the decrease in total diversified industrial segment assets in 2016 was primarily due to the effect of currency rate fluctuations and a decrease in prepaid expenses, inventory, intangible assets, trade accounts receivable, net and plant and equipment, net, partially offset by an increase in marketable securities and other investments, cash and cash equivalents, deferred income taxes and goodwill.
sales in 2017 were higher than the 2016 level primarily due to higher volume in the military original equipment manufacturer ("oem") and commercial and military aftermarket businesses, partially offset by lower volume in the commercial oem business. sales in 2016 were higher than the 2015 level as higher volume in the military oem and commercial and military aftermarket businesses was partially offset by lower volume in the commercial oem business.
the slightly lower margin in 2017 was primarily due to an unfavorable oem product mix, higher warranty-related costs, higher favorable contract settlements in 2016, and higher business realignment expenses, partially offset by higher aftermarket profitability and lower engineering development and operating expenses. the higher margin in 2016 was primarily due to a favorable product mix, favorable contract settlements, lower engineering development expenses and lower operating costs.
the decrease in backlog in 2017 was primarily due to shipments exceeding orders in the commercial and military oem businesses, partially offset by orders exceeding shipments in the commercial and military aftermarket businesses. the increase in backlog in 2016 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in the military oem and commercial and military aftermarket businesses, partially offset by shipments exceeding orders in the commercial oem business. backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. the dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale.
corporate general and administrative expenses were $172.6 million in 2017 compared to $173.2 million in 2016 and $215.4 million in 2015. as a percent of sales, corporate general and administrative expenses in 2017 were 1.4 percent of sales compared to 1.5 percent in 2016 and 1.7 percent in 2015. the lower expense in 2017 was primarily due to lower expenses associated with the company's deferred compensation program as well as lower professional services fees. the lower expense in 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in research and development expense and lower incentive compensation expense.
corporate assets decreased 62.1 percent in 2017 compared to a decrease of 12.5 percent from 2015 to 2016. the decrease in corporate assets in 2017 was primarily due to decreases in cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and non-current deferred taxes. decreases in these assets in 2017 primarily resulted from the clarcor acquisition. the decrease in corporate assets in 2016 was primarily due to decreases in marketable securities and other investments, non-trade and notes receivable, cash and cash equivalents and the effect of currency rate fluctuations, partially offset by an increase in deferred income taxes.

foreign currency transaction primarily relates to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash, marketable securities and other investments and intercompany transactions. the lower pension expense in 2017 is primarily due to the use of the spot yield curve approach to estimate the interest cost component of net periodic pension cost. previously, this cost component of net periodic pension cost was estimated using a single-weighted average discount rate. divestitures and asset sales and writedowns in 2017 includes a gain on the sale of the company's autoline product line. acquisition expenses in 2017 primarily relate to the clarcor acquisition (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion).
discussion of consolidated balance sheet the consolidated balance sheet shows the company's financial position at year-end, compared with the previous year-end. this discussion provides information to assist in assessing factors such as the company's liquidity and financial resources.

shareholders' equity                                               5,262               4,575
working capital                                                   $1,384              $2,842
cash (comprised of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and other investments) includes $874 million and $2,065 million held by the company's foreign subsidiaries at june 30, 2017 and june 30, 2016, respectively. generally, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and other investments held by foreign subsidiaries are not readily available for use in the united states without adverse tax consequences. during 2017, the company utilized approximately $1,774 million in cash from its foreign subsidiaries principally to fund the acquisition of clarcor stock and foreign assets. the company's principal sources of liquidity are its cash flows provided by operating activities, commercial paper borrowings or borrowings directly from its line of credit. the company does not believe the level of its non-u.s. cash position will have an adverse effect on working capital needs, planned growth, repayment of maturing debt, benefit plan funding, dividend payments or share repurchases.
trade accounts receivable, net are receivables due from customers for sales of product. days sales outstanding relating to trade receivables for the company was 51 days in 2017 and 49 days in 2016. the company believes that its receivables are collectible and appropriate allowances for doubtful accounts have been recorded.
inventories increased $376 million from 2016 primarily due to acquisitions (which accounted for an increase of $295 million), as well an increase in inventories in the diversified industrial international businesses and the aerospace systems segment. days supply of inventory on hand was 67 days in 2017 and 62 days in 2016.
deferred income tax asset as of june 30, 2017 decreased compared to june 30, 2016 primarily as a result of the clarcor acquisition. refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
intangible assets and goodwill as of june 30, 2017 both increased compared to june 30, 2016 primarily due to current-year acquisitions. refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
notes payable and long-term debt payable within one year and long-term debt as of june 30, 2017 increased from the june 30, 2016 amounts due primarily to new debt issuances as well as higher commercial paper notes outstanding. refer to notes 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
shareholders' equity activity during 2017 included a decrease of $265 million related to share repurchases, a decrease of $82 million related to foreign currency translation adjustments and an increase of $385 million related to pensions and postretirement benefits.
discussion of consolidated statement of cash flows the consolidated statement of cash flows reflects cash inflows and outflows from the company's operating, investing and financing activities.
operating activities                                          $1,302              $1,211              $1,363
investing activities                                          (3,365   )            (265   )            (579   )
financing activities                                           1,783                (843   )          (1,106   )
cash flows from operating activities in 2017 reflects an increase in net income from 2016 of $177 million and a reduction of $28 million for cash used by working capital items. cash flows from operating activities in 2016 reflects a decrease in net income from 2015 of $205 million and an increase of $120 million for cash provided by working capital items. cash flows from operating activities in 2015 reflects a reduction of $257 million for cash used by working capital items. the company also made voluntary cash contributions to the company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan of $220 million in 2017 and $200 million in 2016.
cash flows used in investing activities in 2017 includes $4,069 million related to acquisition activity, primarily related to clarcor. cash flows used in investing activities in 2017, 2016 and 2015 includes $814 million, $(51) million and $(356) million, respectively, in net maturities (purchases) of marketable securities and other investments.
cash flows used in financing activities during 2017 included the issuance of approximately $2,646 million of notional borrowings of long-term debt as well as the repayment of long-term debt of approximately $381 million, which includes debt assumed in the clarcor acquisition. the company repurchased 2.0 million common shares for $265 million during 2017 as compared to the repurchase of 5.1 million common shares for $558 million in 2016 and 11.1 million common shares for $1,394 million in 2015.
the company's goal is to maintain no less than an "a" rating on senior debt to ensure availability and reasonable cost of external funds. in periods following significant capital deployment, including for share repurchases or acquisitions, certain of the ratings assigned to the company's senior debt may be, and at june 30, 2017 were, lower than the stated goal. the company's ability to borrow funds at desirable tenors and interest rates in february 2017 was not significantly impacted by certain ratings on senior debt that were below an "a" level. the company does not believe that its ability to borrow funds in the future at desirable tenors and affordable interest rates will be impacted if certain of its ratings are below an "a" level at the time of such borrowings. at june 30, 2017, the long-term credit ratings assigned to the company's senior debt securities by the credit rating agencies engaged by the company were as follows:
fitch ratings                     a-
standard &amp; poor's             a as of june 30, 2017, the company had a line of credit totaling $2,000 million through a multi-currency revolving credit agreement with a group of banks, $1,466 million of which was available at june 30, 2017. refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
the company's credit agreements and indentures governing certain debt agreements contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the applicable agreements for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the applicable agreements. the company is in compliance with all covenants and expects to remain in compliance during the term of the credit agreements and indentures.
contractual obligations - the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, for uncertain tax positions was $163 million at june 30, 2017. payment of these obligations would result from settlements with worldwide taxing authorities. due to the difficulty in determining the timing of the settlements, these obligations are not included in the following summary of the company's fixed contractual obligations. references to notes are to the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
retirement benefits (note 10)             123                            75                    12                    11                            25
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. the policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment.
revenue recognition - substantially all of the diversified industrial segment revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product has shipped and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred or services have been rendered, the price to the customer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured, which is generally at the time the product is shipped. the aerospace systems segment recognizes revenues primarily using the percentage-of-completion method and the extent of progress toward completion is primarily measured using the units-of-delivery method. the company estimates costs to complete long-term contracts for purposes of evaluating and establishing contract reserves. the estimation of these costs requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved. adjustments to cost estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues.
impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets - goodwill is tested for impairment, at the reporting unit level, on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. for the company, a reporting unit is one level below the operating segment level. determining whether an impairment has occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit, which the company has consistently estimated using primarily a discounted cash flow model. the company believes that the use of a discounted cash flow model results in the most accurate calculation of a reporting unit's fair value since the market value for a reporting unit is not readily available. the discounted cash flow analysis requires several assumptions including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industry specific market conditions. each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis. the company has consistently used a discount rate commensurate with its cost of capital, adjusted for inherent business risks, and an appropriate terminal growth factor. the company also reconciles the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units as derived from the discounted cash flow analysis to the company's overall market capitalization.
the results of the company's 2017 annual goodwill impairment test performed as of december 31, 2016 indicated that no goodwill impairment existed. the company continually monitors its reporting units for impairment indicators and updates assumptions used in the most recent calculation of the fair value of a reporting unit as appropriate. the company is unaware of any current market trends that are contrary to the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of any of its reporting units. if actual experience is not consistent with the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units, especially assumptions regarding penetration into new markets and the recovery of the current economic environment, it is possible that the estimated fair value of certain reporting units could fall below their carrying value resulting in the necessity to conduct additional goodwill impairment tests.
long-lived assets held for use, which primarily includes finite-lived intangible assets and plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value. the long-term nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test. during 2017, there were no events or circumstances that indicated that the carrying value of the company's long-lived assets held for use were not recoverable.
pensions - the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the company's defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis. this determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate, long-term rate of return on plan assets, increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses. assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements. beginning in 2017, the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. the new method uses the spot yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligations to
relevant cash outflows. previously, these costs were determined using a single-weighted average discount rate. the change does not affect the measurement of the company's benefit obligations. the new method provides a more precise measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates and was accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2017. annual net periodic pension expense in 2017 was lower by approximately $30 million compared to the previous method. annual net periodic postretirement cost was not materially different.
for the company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan, a 50 basis point change in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated to have a $14 million effect on annual pension expense and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to increase annual pension expense by $26 million. as of june 30, 2017, $1,081 million of past years' net actuarial losses related to the company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future. these losses will generally be amortized over approximately seven years and will negatively affect earnings in the future. actuarial gains experienced in future years will help reduce the effect of the actuarial loss amortization. further information on pensions is provided in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
income taxes - significant judgment is required in determining the company's income tax expense and in evaluating tax positions. deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been recorded for the differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities. factors considered by the company in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets include forecasted operating earnings, available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse. the company reviews its tax positions on a regular basis and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon examination by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information will be recorded. for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. further information on income taxes is provided in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
loss contingencies - the company has a number of loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims, product liability and litigation reserves. establishing loss accruals for these matters requires management's estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization. these loss accruals are reviewed periodically and adjustments are made to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances.

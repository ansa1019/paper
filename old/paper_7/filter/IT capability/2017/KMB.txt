item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this md&a is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our recent performance, financial condition and prospects. this discussion and analysis compares 2017 results to 2016, and 2016 results to 2015. the reference to "n.m." indicates that the calculation is not meaningful. in addition, we provide commentary regarding organic sales growth, which describes the impact of changes in volume, product mix and net selling prices on net sales. changes in foreign currency rates and acquisitions and divestitures also impact the year-over-year change in net sales. dollar amounts are reported in millions, except per share dollar amounts, unless otherwise noted.
•   unaudited quarterly data
•   liquidity and capital resources
•   critical accounting policies and use of estimates
•   information concerning forward-looking statements throughout this md&a, we refer to financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s., or gaap, and are therefore referred to as non-gaap financial measures. these measures include adjusted gross and operating profit, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted other (income) and expense, net, and adjusted effective tax rate. we believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the financial measures used to evaluate management.
non-gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable gaap measures, and they should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap.  there are limitations to these non-gaap financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculation and items being excluded.  we compensate for these limitations by using these non-gaap financial measures as a supplement to the gaap measures and by providing reconciliations of the non-gaap and comparable gaap financial measures.
the non-gaap financial measures exclude the following items for the relevant time periods as indicated in the reconciliations included later in this md&a:
•   u.s. tax reform related matters - in the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized a net benefit as a result of u.s. tax reform and related activities.
•   2014 organization restructuring - in 2014, we initiated this restructuring in order to improve organization efficiency and offset the impact of stranded overhead costs resulting from the 2014 spin-off of our health care business. as a result, we recognized restructuring charges in 2014, 2015 and 2016. restructuring actions were completed by december 31, 2016. see item 8, note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
•   adjustments related to venezuelan operations - results in 2016 and 2015 include adjustments for the deconsolidation of our venezuelan operations, and in 2015 include charges for remeasuring the local currency balance sheet in venezuela. see item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
•   pension settlement charges - in 2015, we recorded settlement-related charges from certain actions taken for our u.s. pension plan. see item 8, note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
•   uncertain tax positions adjustment - in 2015, we updated our assessment of uncertain tax positions for certain international operations, and recorded a charge related to prior years in provision for income taxes. see item 8, note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for details.

the effective tax rate of 25.9 percent in 2017 decreased compared to 30.6 percent in 2016. the rate in 2017 included a net benefit as a result of u.s. tax reform and related activity. this amount included a net expense of $278 for the transition tax and a net benefit of $202 for the remeasurement of deferred taxes associated with the corporate rate reduction and our reassessment of permanently reinvested earnings. in addition, it included a net benefit of $152 for certain tax planning actions that were taken in the fourth quarter of 2017 in anticipation of the enactment of the tax act. see additional details in item 8, note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. the adjusted effective rate was 28.6 percent in 2017 and 30.7 percent in 2016.
our share of net income of equity companies was $104 in 2017 and $132 in 2016. kimberly-clark de mexico, s.a.b. de c.v. ("kcm") results in 2017 were impacted by higher input costs, partially offset by benefits from sales growth and cost savings.
net sales of $18.2 billion decreased 2 percent compared to 2015, as changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by about 4 percent. organic sales increased approximately 2 percent due to higher volumes. operating profit was $3,317 in 2016 versus $1,613 in 2015. results in 2015 included $1,358 of pension settlement charges and $153 of charges related to our venezuelan operations. adjusted operating profit of $3,341 in 2016 increased 4 percent compared to $3,210 in 2015. results in 2016 included benefits from organic sales growth, $435 of force cost savings and $70 of savings from the 2014 organization restructuring. in addition, input costs were $65 lower. translation effects due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates lowered operating profit by $90 and transaction effects also negatively impacted results.
adjusted other (income) and expense, net of $22 in 2016 decreased compared to $62 in 2015 due to higher currency transaction losses in 2015. the decrease in our effective tax rate of 30.6 percent in 2016 compared to 31.3 percent in 2015 is primarily due to certain planning initiatives. our share of net income of equity companies was $132 in 2016 and $149 in 2015. kcm results in 2016 compared to 2015 were negatively impacted by a weaker mexican peso and higher input costs, partially offset by benefits from organic sales growth and cost savings.

net sales in developing and emerging markets increased 6 percent as sales volumes increased 5 percent and favorable currency rates increased sales by 1 percent. sales benefited by 1 percent from changes in product mix and an additional slight benefit from our acquisition of our joint venture in india, offset by lower net selling prices of about 2 percent. the volume increase was driven by gains in latin america, primarily argentina and brazil, china, eastern europe and middle east/africa.

2018 global restructuring program on january 23, 2018, we announced a new global restructuring program. the 2018 global restructuring program will reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying the company's manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization. the program will make our overhead organization structure and manufacturing supply chain less complex and more efficient. we expect to close or sell approximately 10 manufacturing facilities and expand production capacity at several others. we expect to exit or divest some lower-margin businesses that generate approximately 1 percent of our net sales. the sales are concentrated in our consumer tissue business segment. the restructuring is expected to impact all of our business segments and our organizations in all major geographies. workforce reductions are expected to be in the range of 5,000 to 5,500. certain capital appropriations under the 2018 global restructuring program are being finalized. accounting for actions related to each appropriation will commence when the appropriation is authorized for execution.
the restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of 2020, with total costs anticipated to be $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion pre-tax ($1.35 billion to $1.5 billion after tax). cash costs are expected to be $900 to $1.0 billion, primarily related to workforce reductions.  non-cash charges are primarily related to incremental depreciation and asset write-offs. annual pre-tax savings from the restructuring are expected to be $500 to $550 by 2021. in addition, to implement this program, we expect to incur incremental capital spending of approximately $600 to $700 by the end of 2020. restructuring charges in 2018 are expected to be $1.2 billion to $1.35 billion pre-tax ($950 to $1.05 billion after tax). we expect to generate savings of $50 to $70 in 2018.

liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations cash provided by operations was $2.9 billion in 2017 compared to $3.2 billion in 2016. the decrease was driven by higher tax payments. cash provided by operations was $2.3 billion in 2015. the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by improved working capital and lower pension contributions.
unconditional purchase obligations        1,173                 699                 206                 204                 8                 5                 51
•   the unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials, primarily superabsorbent materials, pulp and utilities. although we are primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations, based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows, we believe exposure to losses, if any, under these arrangements is not material.
•   we will fund our defined benefit pension plans to meet or exceed statutory requirements and currently expect to contribute up to $100 to these plans in 2018.
•   other postretirement benefit payments are estimated using actuarial assumptions, including expected future service, to project the future obligations. based upon those projections, we anticipate making annual payments for these obligations ranging from $58 in 2018 to more than $60 by 2027.
•   accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, deferred taxes and noncontrolling interests.
investing our capital spending was $0.8 billion in 2017 and 2016. we expect capital spending to be approximately $1.1 billion in 2018, including incremental spending from the 2018 global restructuring program.
financing we issue long-term debt in the public market periodically. proceeds from the offerings are used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of maturing debt or outstanding commercial paper indebtedness. see item 8, note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
our short-term debt, which consists of u.s. commercial paper with original maturities up to 90 days and/or other similar short-term debt issued by non-u.s. subsidiaries, was $547 as of december 31, 2017 (included in debt payable within one year on the consolidated balance sheet). the average month-end balance of short-term debt for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $419 and for the twelve months ended december 31, 2017 was $417. these short-term borrowings provide supplemental funding for supporting our operations. the level of short-term debt generally fluctuates depending upon the amount of operating cash flows and the timing of customer receipts and payments for items such as pension contributions, dividends and income taxes.
we maintain a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in 2021. this facility, currently unused, supports our commercial paper program, and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason.
20      kimberly-clark corporation - 2017 annual report during 2017, we repurchased 7.2 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $900 through a broker in the open market. we are targeting full-year 2018 share repurchases between $700 and $900, subject to market conditions.
management believes that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending, payment of dividends, pension plan contributions and other needs for the foreseeable future. further, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the u.s. to have a material effect on our overall business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future.
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. the critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used. the critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances, pension and other postretirement benefits, deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments. these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors.
sales incentives and trade promotion allowances trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees, cooperative marketing programs, temporary price reductions, end-of-aisle or in-store product displays and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products. rebate and promotion accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales. promotion accruals also consider estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and timing and costs of activities within the promotional programs. generally, the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption, influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories. our related accounting policies are discussed in item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. the accounting policies for these programs did not materially change with the adoption, on january 1, 2018, of the accounting standard update no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers.
employee postretirement benefits we have defined benefit pension plans in the u.s. and the united kingdom (the "principal plans") and/or defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees. certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or, in certain countries, termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees. our related accounting policies and account balances are discussed in item 8, note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
changes in certain assumptions could affect pension expense and the benefit obligations, particularly the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate the obligations:
as of december 31, 2017, the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately $1.5 billion. these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns, (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations, or (iii) other actuarial gains, including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the "corridor" as required. if the expected long-term rates of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 0.25 percent, the impact on annual pension expense would not be material in 2018.
•   discount rate. the discount (or settlement) rate used to determine the present value of our future u.s. pension obligation at december 31, 2017 was based on a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with cash flows that largely match the expected benefit payments of the plan. for the united kingdom plan, the discount rate was determined based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities. each year's expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate to determine the pension obligations.
21      kimberly-clark corporation - 2017 annual report if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, the increase in annual pension expense would not be material in 2018, and the december 31, 2017 pension liability would increase by about $145.
•   other assumptions. there are a number of other assumptions involved in the calculation of pension expense and benefit obligations, primarily related to participant demographics and benefit elections.
pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate $35 in 2018. pension expense beyond 2018 will depend on future investment performance, our contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered participants in the plans. the estimate of pension expense for 2018 does not include any potential effects related to the 2018 global restructuring program (see item 8, note 15 to the consolidated financial statements).
substantially all u.s. retirees and employees have access to our unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans. changes in significant assumptions could affect the consolidated expense and benefit obligations, particularly the discount rates used to calculate the obligations and the health care cost trend rate:
•   discount rate. the determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above, and the methodology for each country is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate for that country's pension obligation. if the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, the impact to 2018 other postretirement benefit expense and the increase in the december 31, 2017 benefit liability would not be material.
our related accounting policies, account balances and the effects of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate are discussed in item 8, note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
deferred income taxes and potential assessments as a global organization, we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the u.s. and internationally. changes in certain assumptions related to income taxes could significantly affect consolidated results, particularly with regard to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside the u.s. and uncertain tax positions. our income tax related accounting policies, account balances and matters affecting income taxes are discussed in item 8, note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
•   deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances. we have recorded deferred tax assets related to, among other matters, income tax loss carryforwards, income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards and have established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets. these carryforwards are primarily in non-u.s. taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the u.s. foreign tax credits earned in the u.s. in current and prior years, which cannot be used currently, also give rise to net deferred tax assets. in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets, many factors are considered, including the specific taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward period, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction. a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
•   undistributed earnings. deferred taxes have been recorded for foreign and u.s. state income taxes on $1.0 billion of earnings of foreign consolidated subsidiaries expected to be repatriated. we do not intend to distribute $4.5 billion of earnings of foreign consolidated subsidiaries taxed as part of the transition tax and have not recorded any deferred taxes related to such amounts for foreign and u.s. state income taxes. we consider any excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis of our investment in our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. at this time, the determination of deferred tax liabilities on this amount is not practicable.
•   uncertain tax positions. we record our global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which we operate. where we believe that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in our income tax returns. where treatment of a position is uncertain, a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations

legal matters we are party to certain legal proceedings relating to our former health care business, halyard, which we spun-off on october 31, 2014. this includes bahamas surgery center v. kimberly-clark corporation, et al., a california consumer class action relating to the sale of surgical gowns. on april 7, 2017, the jury awarded the plaintiff class $3.9 in compensatory damages and $350 in punitive damages against us. we have filed motions challenging the jury's verdict as we believe it is contrary to the evidence presented at trial and that the punitive damage award is baseless, excessive and not consistent with california and federal laws. under the terms of the distribution agreement we entered into with halyard in connection with the spin-off, halyard is obligated to indemnify us for legal proceedings, claims and other liabilities primarily related to our former health care business. halyard and kimberly-clark have each filed suits against the other seeking declaratory judgment regarding the scope of these indemnification obligations. we are also party to additional legal proceedings relating to halyard, including civil actions, qui tam matters, a shareholder derivative suit, a securities class action and certain subpoena and document requests from the federal government. although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we continue to believe that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
new accounting standards see item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting standards and their anticipated effects on our consolidated financial statements.
business outlook in 2018, we plan to continue to execute our global business plan strategies, which include a focus on targeted growth initiatives, innovation and brand building, cost savings programs and shareholder-friendly capital allocation. in 2018, we expect earnings per share to be $3.90 to $4.50. adjusted earnings per share are expected to be $6.90 to $7.20, which excludes 2018 global restructuring program charges equivalent to $2.70 to $3.00. our adjusted earnings per share guidance is based on the assumptions described below:
•   we expect net sales to increase 1 to 2 percent. we anticipate changes in foreign currency exchange rates to have a neutral to 1 percent positive impact on net sales, and the acquisition of our joint venture in india should benefit sales slightly.
•   we expect adjusted operating profit growth of 2 to 5 percent.
•   we expect inflation in key cost inputs of $300 to $400. we anticipate the majority of the inflation to occur in international markets.
•   we expect net income from equity companies similar, or up slightly, year-on-year.

business overview ameteks operations are affected by global, regional and industry economic factors. however, the companys strategic geographic and industry diversification, and its mix of products and services, have helped to mitigate the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. in 2017, the company established records for orders, sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. the strengthening global economic environment compared to 2016, contributions from recent acquisitions, and continued focus on and implementation of operational excellence initiatives, had a positive impact on 2017 results. the company also benefited from its strategic initiatives under ameteks four key strategies: operational excellence, strategic acquisitions, global & market expansion and new products.

in 2017, the company established records for orders, sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. the continued strengthening global economic environment, contributions from the acquisitions completed in 2017 and the acquisitions of laserage technology corporation (laserage) in october 2016, hs foils and nu instruments in july 2016, and brookfield engineering laboratories (brookfield) and esp/surgex in january 2016, and continued focus on and implementation of operational excellence initiatives, including the 2017 and 2016 realignment actions (described further throughout the results of operations for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31, 2017), are expected to have a positive impact on the companys 2018 results.
net sales for 2017 were $4,300.2 million, an increase of $460.1 million or 12.0%, compared with net sales of $3,840.1 million in 2016. the increase in net sales for 2017 was due to 6% organic sales growth and a 6% increase from acquisitions. foreign currency translation was essentially flat period over period. eig net sales were $2,690.6 million in 2017, an increase of 14.0%, compared with $2,360.3 million in 2016. emg net sales were $1,609.6 million in 2017, an increase of 8.8%, compared with $1,479.8 million in 2016.

orders for 2017 were $4,539.8 million, an increase of $691.0 million or 18.0%, compared with $3,848.8 million in 2016. the increase in orders for 2017 was due to 10% organic order growth, a 6% increase from acquisitions and favorable 2% effect of foreign currency translation. as a result, the companys backlog of unfilled orders at december 31, 2017 was a record $1,396.1 million, an increase of $239.6 million or 20.7%, compared with $1,156.5 million at december 31, 2016.
the company recorded 2017 realignment costs totaling $16.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 (the 2017 realignment costs). the 2017 realignment costs were composed of $3.0 million in severance costs for a reduction in workforce, $7.8 million of asset write-downs and $6.0 million in costs to withdraw from a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan. the 2017 realignment costs better position the companys long-term cost structure and included costs associated with the continued consolidation of the companys floor care and specialty motors businesses into its precision motion control businesses. the company recorded 2016 realignment costs totaling $25.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 (the 2016 realignment costs). the 2016 realignment costs primarily related to $19.3 million in severance costs for a reduction in workforce and $6.2 million of asset write-downs in response to the impact of a weak global economy on certain of the companys businesses, as well as the effects of a continued strong u.s. dollar. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further details. also, in the fourth quarter of 2016, the company recorded a $13.9 million non-cash impairment charge related to certain of the companys trade names.
segment operating income for 2017 was $988.4 million, an increase of $132.8 million or 15.5%, compared with segment operating income of $855.6 million in 2016. the increase in segment operating income for 2017 resulted primarily from the increase in net sales noted above. segment operating income, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 23.0% in 2017, compared with 22.3% in 2016. the increase in segment operating margins for 2017 resulted primarily from the net impact of the 2017 versus the 2016 realignment costs and 2016 impairment charge noted above. segment operating income and segment operating margins for 2017 and 2016 included the impact of the realignment costs and 2016 impairment charge detailed in the tables above.
cost of sales for 2017 was $2,851.4 million or 66.3% of net sales, an increase of $276.2 million or 10.7%, compared with $2,575.2 million or 67.1% of net sales for 2016. the cost of sales increase for 2017 was affected by the net sales increase noted above. cost of sales for 2017 and 2016 included the impact of the realignment costs and 2016 impairment charge detailed in the tables above.
selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses for 2017 were $533.6 million or 12.4% of net sales, an increase of $70.6 million or 15.2%, compared with $463.0 million or 12.1% of net sales in 2016. the increase in sg&a expenses for 2017 was primarily due to the increase in net sales noted above, a fourth quarter of 2017 $5.0 million charitable donation and a second quarter of 2017 $2.5 million equity-based compensation charge related to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock grants in association with the retirement of the companys executive chairman of the board of directors. for 2016, sg&a expenses included $1.6 million of realignment costs noted above.

interest expense was $98.0 million for 2017, an increase of $3.7 million or 3.9%, compared with $94.3 million in 2016. the interest expense increase for 2017 was primarily due to the impact of private placement senior notes funded in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by lower average borrowings under the companys revolving credit facility period over period.
other expenses, net were $20.3 million for 2017, an increase of $5.8 million, compared with $14.5 million in 2016. the other expenses, net increase for 2017 was primarily due to higher environmental-related expenses.
the effective tax rate for 2017 was 14.5%, compared with 26.1% in 2016. on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (the act). the act, which is also commonly referred to as u.s. tax reform, significantly changes u.s. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, reducing the u.s. corporate income tax rate to 21% starting in 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of u.s. subsidiaries. as a result, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the company recorded a net benefit of $91.6 million in the consolidated statement of income as a component of provision for income taxes. the $91.6 million net benefit consisted of a $185.8 million benefit resulting from the remeasurement of the companys net deferred tax liabilities in the u.s. based on the new lower corporate income tax rate and a $94.2 million expense relating to the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred earnings of certain non-u.s. subsidiaries that are owned either wholly or partially by a u.s. subsidiary of the company. also, included in the $94.2 million, the company recorded additional deferred tax liabilities of $13.3 million related to state income and foreign withholding taxes expected to be incurred when the cash amounts related to the mandatory tax are ultimately repatriated to the u.s., offset by $1.0 million for a remeasurement of uncertain tax positions impacted by the mandatory tax inclusion.
although the $91.6 million net benefit represents what the company believes is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the income tax effects of the act on the companys consolidated financial statements as of december 31, 2017, it should be considered provisional. as additional guidance from the u.s. department of treasury is provided, the company may need to adjust the provisional amounts after it finalizes the 2017 u.s. tax return and is able to conclude whether any further adjustments are required to its u.s. portion of net deferred tax liability of $390.4 million as of december 31, 2017, as well as to the liability associated with the one-time mandatory tax. the currently recorded amounts include a variety of estimates of taxable earnings and profits, estimated taxable foreign cash balances, differences between u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) and u.s. tax principles and interpretations of many aspects of the act that may, if changed, impact the final amounts. any adjustments to these provisional amounts will be reported as a component of provision for income taxes in the reporting period in which any such adjustments are determined, which will be no later than the fourth quarter of 2018, and could result in significant impacts to the effective tax rate for the period. the company is still evaluating the potential future impact of the global intangible low-taxed income (gilti) section of the act and has not provided any provisional deferred tax liability for it. under u.s. gaap, the company is permitted to make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on future inclusions in the u.s. taxable income related to gilti as a current period expense when incurred or to factor such amounts into the companys measurement of its deferred taxes. due to the ongoing evaluation, the company has not yet made the accounting policy decision. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further details.
the 2017 effective tax rate reflects $12.3 million of tax benefits related to share-based payment transactions in accordance with the january 1, 2017 adoption of the financial accounting standards board (fasb) accounting standards update (asu) no. 2016-09, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting (asu 2016-09). see notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further details.

(2)   see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further details.
(3)   represents a capital lease for a building and land associated with the cameca sas acquisition. the lease has a term of 12 years, which began in july 2006, and is payable quarterly.
$3.7 million is classified as long-term. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further details.
(5)   the leases expire over a range of years from 2018 to 2082 with renewal or purchase options, subject to various terms and conditions, contained in most of the leases.
(6)   purchase obligations primarily consist of contractual commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed prices.
other commitments the company has standby letters of credit and surety bonds of $47.3 million related to performance and payment guarantees at december 31, 2017. based on experience with these arrangements, the company believes that any obligations that may arise will not be material to its financial position.
critical accounting policies the company has identified its critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the companys financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based on the companys historical experience and managements judgment. because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ materially from the estimates used. the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the companys accounting policies and to managements discussion and analysis. the information that follows represents additional specific disclosures about the companys accounting policies regarding risks, estimates, subjective decisions or assessments whereby materially different financial condition and results of operations could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed. primary disclosure of the companys significant accounting policies is in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
                                                                                          revenue recognition. the company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is complete. this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. for a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. the companys policy with respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances, except at the companys option. the company has agreements with distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return for unsold products. the distributor purchases the product from the company, at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the distributor. the company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume discounts. the company accounts for these sales incentives as a reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. accruals for sales returns, other allowances and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time revenue is recognized based on the companys historical experience. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, the accrual for future warranty obligations was $22.9 million and $22.0 million, respectively. the companys expense for warranty obligations was $16.0 million in both 2017 and 2016, and $14.8 million in 2015, respectively. the warranty periods for products sold vary among the companys operations, but generally do not exceed one year. the company calculates its warranty expense provision based on its historical warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses. if actual future sales returns and allowances and warranty amounts are higher than the companys historical experience, additional accruals may be required.
                                                                                        accounts receivable. the company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial obligations to the company. a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against the amount due from these customers. for all other customers, the company recognizes allowance for doubtful accounts based on the length of time specific receivables are past due based on its historical experience. if the financial condition of the companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. the allowance for doubtful accounts was $10.4 million and $10.3 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
                                                                                                          inventories. the company uses the first-in, first-out (fifo) method of accounting, which approximates current replacement cost, for approximately 84% of its inventories at december 31,
2017. for inventories where cost is determined by the lifo method, the fifo value would have been $22.9 million and $18.4 million higher than the lifo value reported in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the company provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and related management initiatives. if these factors are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory reserves may be required.
                                                                                       business combinations. the company allocates the purchase price of an acquired company, including when applicable, the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values, with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. third party appraisal firms and other consultants are engaged to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. estimating fair values requires significant judgments, estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to: discount rates, future cash flows and the economic lives of trade names, technology, customer relationships, property, plant and equipment, as well as income taxes. these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies, and are inherently uncertain.
                                                                                       goodwill and other intangible assets. goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. for the purpose of the goodwill impairment test, the company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units. the company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen and performed the first step quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test in the current year. the company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods. the first step in the quantitative process is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized. an impairment charge would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the reporting unit fair value.
the company identifies its reporting units at the component level, which is one level below its operating segments. generally, goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. the companys reporting units are divisions that are one level below its operating segments and for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.
the company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate. the company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction. the annual goodwill impairment test requires the company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements, which are based on the companys long-range plan and are considered level 3 inputs. the companys long-range plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management. the discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. while the company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, the companys overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged. in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations, the company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease in fair values of each reporting unit. the 2017 results (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) showed that, despite the hypothetical 10% decrease in fair value, the fair values of the companys reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values by 20% to 670% for each of the companys reporting units.
the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. the company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those assets. the company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen. the company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods. the company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method using level 3 inputs. the company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
the companys acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the company expects to continue to make acquisitions. at december 31, 2017, goodwill and other indefinite-lived
intangible assets totaled $3,724.6 million or 47.7% of the companys total assets. the company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2017 and determined that the carrying values of the companys goodwill were not impaired.
other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. the carrying value of other intangible assets with finite lives is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value. in that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of those assets. fair value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.
                                                                                            pensions. the company has u.s. and foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. the most significant elements in determining the companys pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. the pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be settled at the valuation date. at the end of each year, the company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities. in estimating this rate for 2017, the company considered rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments that have maturities consistent with the anticipated funding requirements of the plan. the discount rate used in determining the 2017 pension cost was 7.50% for u.s. defined benefit pension plans and 6.79% for foreign plans. the discount rate used for determining the funded status of the plans at december 31, 2017 and determining the 2018 defined benefit pension cost was 7.50% for u.s. plans and 6.79% for foreign plans. in estimating the u.s. and foreign discount rates, the companys actuaries developed a customized discount rate appropriate to the plans projected benefit cash flow based on yields derived from a database of long-term bonds at consistent maturity dates. the company used an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2017 of 7.50% for u.s. defined benefit pension plans and 6.79% for foreign plans. in 2018, the company will use 7.50% for the u.s. plans and 6.64% for the foreign plans. the company determines the expected long-term rate of return based primarily on its expectation of future returns for the pension plans investments. additionally, the company considers historical returns on comparable fixed-income and equity investments, and adjusts its estimate as deemed appropriate. the rate of compensation increase used in determining the 2017 pension income for the u.s. plans was 3.75% and was 2.50% for the foreign plans. the u.s. and foreign plans rate of compensation increase will remain unchanged in 2018. in both 2017 and 2016, the company recognized consolidated pre-tax pension income of $4.3 million from its u.s. and foreign defined benefit pension plans. the company estimates its 2018 u.s. and foreign defined benefit pension pre-tax income to be approximately $15 million.
all unrecognized prior service costs, remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized, net of tax effects, as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost. the company uses a measurement date of december 31 (its fiscal year end) for its u.s. and foreign defined benefit plans.
to fund the plans, the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2017, which totaled $54.8 million, compared with $6.8 million in 2016. the company anticipates making approximately $2 million to $6 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2018.
                                                                                       income taxes. the process of providing for income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. the company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the companys tax assets and liabilities. to
the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to the companys tax assets and liabilities may be necessary.
the company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the companys forecast of future taxable income, available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and the amount of, valuation allowances against the companys deferred tax assets. to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.
the company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions, by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. once the minimum threshold is met, using a more likely than not standard, a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit. the tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination. the underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes, published guidance, external expert opinion, or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past. there can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy, legislation and audit practice. the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.
recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (asu 2014-09) and modified the standard thereafter. the objective of asu 2014-09 is to establish a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition guidance. the core principle of asu 2014-09 is that an entity recognizes revenue at the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. asu 2014-09 applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the fasb accounting standards codification.
asu 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017 and may be early adopted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016. the company adopted asu 2014-09 as of january 1, 2018. the guidance permits adoption by retrospectively applying the guidance to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method) or prospectively applying the guidance and providing additional disclosures comparing results to previous guidance, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized in beginning retained earnings at the date of initial application (modified retrospective method). the company will use the modified retrospective method of adoption.
asu 2014-09 will impact the companys revenue recognition procedures by requiring recognition of certain revenues to move from upon shipment or delivery to over-time. the recording of certain revenues over-time is not expected to have a material impact on the companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. also, the company has developed the additional expanded disclosures required. the company has implemented the appropriate changes to its business processes to support recognition and disclosure under asu 2014-09. the company does not expect the adoption of asu 2014-09 to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
in july 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-11, simplifying the measurement of inventory (asu 2015-11), which applies to inventory that is measured using fifo or average cost. as prescribed in this update, an entity should measure inventory that is within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value, which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of
completion, disposal and transportation. subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory that is measured using lifo. the company prospectively adopted asu 2015-11 effective january 1, 2017 and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
in november 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-17, balance sheet classification of deferred taxes (asu 2015-17). asu 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet. the company prospectively adopted asu 2015-17 effective january 1, 2017. therefore, prior periods have not been adjusted to reflect this adoption. the adoption of asu 2015-17 did not have a significant impact on the companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
in february 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02, leases (asu 2016-02). the new standard establishes a right-of-use model that requires a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. asu 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. asu 2016-02 includes transitional guidance, as currently issued, that calls for a modified retrospective approach. the fasb has recently proposed adding a transition option to the current guidance and it includes optional practical expedients for ease of transition. the company has formed a steering committee to lead the companys implementation project. the company has not determined the impact asu 2016-02 may have on the companys consolidated results of operations, financial position, cash flows and financial statement disclosures, which could be significant to the companys financial position.
in march 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-09, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting. asu 2016-09 includes changes to the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. the company prospectively adopted asu 2016-09 effective january 1, 2017. for the year ended december 31, 2017, the company recorded a tax benefit of $12.3 million within provision for income taxes related to the tax effects of share-based payment transactions. prior to adoption, this amount would have been recorded as a component of capital in excess of par value. the adoption of this standard could create volatility in the companys effective tax rate going forward. the company elected not to change its accounting policy with respect to the estimation of forfeitures. the company no longer reclassifies the excess tax benefits from share-based payments from operating activities to financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. for the year ended december 31, 2017, the company excluded the excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of its diluted earnings per share and the related increase in the companys diluted weighted average common shares outstanding was not significant.
in january 2017, the fasb issued asu no. 2017-01, clarifying the definition of a business (asu 2017-01). asu 2017-01 provides a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business. asu 2017-01 requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets; if so, the set of assets is not a business. asu 2017-01 requires that, to be a business, the set must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. asu 2017-01 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. asu 2017-01 will be applied prospectively to any transactions occurring within the period of adoption. early adoption is permitted, including for interim or annual periods in which the financial statements have not been issued or made available for issuance. the company does not expect the adoption of asu 2017-01 to have a significant impact on the companys consolidated results of operations, financial position, cash flows and financial statement disclosures.
in january 2017, the fasb issued asu no. 2017-04, simplifying the test for goodwill impairment (asu 2017-04). asu 2017-04 eliminates the requirement to calculate the reporting unit fair value of goodwill
(second step) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. under the guidance, an impairment charge will be measured based on the excess of the reporting units carrying amount over its fair value (first step). asu 2017-04 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. the company early adopted asu 2017-04 effective january 1, 2017 and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the companys consolidated results of operations, financial position, cash flows and financial statement disclosures.
in march 2017, the fasb issued asu no. 2017-07, improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost (asu 2017-07), which changes how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement benefit plans present the net periodic benefit cost in the income statement. asu 2017-07 requires employers to present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs. all other components of the net periodic benefit cost will be presented outside of operating income. asu 2017-07 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. the changes in presentation will be applied retrospectively when adopted. the company expects restated 2017 cost of sales to increase $11.5 million with an offsetting $11.5 million increase to other operating income. the 2018 service cost included in operating income is expected to approximate 2017 service cost of $7.1 million. the company does not expect the adoption of asu 2017-07 to have a significant impact on the companys consolidated financial position, cash flows and financial statement disclosures.
in may 2017, the fasb issued asu no. 2017-09, scope of modification accounting (asu 2017-09). asu 2017-09 clarifies which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. asu 2017-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. the company does not expect the adoption of asu 2017-09 to have a significant impact on the companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
internal reinvestment capital expenditures capital expenditures were $75.1 million or 1.7% of net sales in 2017, compared with $63.3 million or 1.6% of net sales in 2016. in 2017, approximately 55% of capital expenditures were for improvements to existing equipment or additional equipment to increase productivity and expand capacity. capital expenditures in 2018 are expected to approximate 2% of net sales, with a continued emphasis on spending to improve productivity.
research, development and engineering the company is committed to, and has consistently invested in, research, development and engineering activities to design and develop new and improved products and solutions. research, development and engineering costs before customer reimbursement were $221.2 million in 2017 and $200.8 million in both 2016 and 2015. customer reimbursements in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $5.4 million, $7.2 million and $6.9 million, respectively. these amounts included research and development expenses of $130.4 million, $112.0 million and $116.3 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. all such expenditures were directed toward the development of new products and solutions and the improvement of existing products and solutions.
environmental matters certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. the company believes these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time. at december 31, 2017, the company is named a potentially responsible party (prp) at 13 non-ametek-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the non-owned sites). the company is identified as a de minimis party in 12 of these sites based on the low
volume of waste attributed to the company relative to the amounts attributed to other named prps. in eight of these sites, the company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. the tentatively agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. in the other four sites, the company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount. at the remaining site where the company is a non-de minimis prp, the company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a prp group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the companys expected obligations. the company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. in addition to these non-owned sites, the company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the owned sites). for claims and proceedings against the company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. this estimate is refined as the company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. in certain instances, the company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the best estimate. it is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. in estimating the companys liability for remediation, the company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other prps to fulfill their obligations.
total environmental reserves at december 31, 2017 and 2016 were $30.1 million and $28.4 million, respectively, for both non-owned and owned sites. in 2017, the company recorded $7.7 million in reserves and the reserve increased $0.4 million due to foreign currency translation. additionally, the company spent $6.4 million on environmental matters in 2017. the companys reserves for environmental liabilities at december 31, 2017 and 2016 included reserves of $11.6 million and $12.4 million, respectively, for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of hcc industries (hcc). the company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a superfund site in the san gabriel valley of california. the company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of hcc related to the costs of the required remedial activities. at december 31, 2017, the company had $12.0 million in receivables related to hcc for probable recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed third-party funds to support the required remediation. also, the company is indemnified by hccs former owners for approximately $19 million of additional costs.
the company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously owned businesses. under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. the company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters. to date, these parties have met their obligations in all material respects.
the company believes it has established reserves for the environmental matters described above, which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. the company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future. in the opinion of management, based on presently available information and the companys historical experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the company.
the company has been remediating groundwater contamination for several contaminants, including trichloroethylene (tce), at a formerly owned site in el cajon, california. several lawsuits have been filed against the company alleging damages resulting from the groundwater contamination, including property damages and personal injury, and seeking compensatory and punitive damages. given the state of uncertainty inherent in these litigations, the company does not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably
possible loss in regard to these matters. the company believes that it has good and valid defenses to each of these claims and intends to defend them vigorously. the company does not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to materially affect the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the company.
market risk the companys primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which could impact its financial condition and results of operations. the company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. the companys differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole.
the companys short-term debt carries variable interest rates and generally its long-term debt carries fixed rates. these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the euro, the british pound, the japanese yen, the chinese renminbi, the canadian dollar, the mexican peso and the swiss franc. exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is modest, monitored, and when possible, mitigated through the use of local borrowings and occasional derivative financial instruments in the foreign currency affected. the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries balance sheets into u.s. dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity. foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies.
the primary commodities to which the company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel, aluminum, copper, steel, titanium and gold. exposure to price changes in these commodities are generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements, although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures.
based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates, commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates, the companys best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings, fair value of risk-sensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material, although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis.
forward-looking information certain matters discussed in this form 10-k are forward-looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 (pslra), which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the companys operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. many such factors will be important in determining the companys actual future results. the company wishes to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the pslra by cautioning readers that numerous important factors, in some cases have caused, and in the future could cause, the companys actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the company. some, but not all, of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under item 1a. risk factors. the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise, unless required by the securities laws to do so.

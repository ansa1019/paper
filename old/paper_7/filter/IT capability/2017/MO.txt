item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10-k, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item 8, and the discussion of cautionary factors that may affect future results in item 1a.
description of the company at december 31, 2017, altria group, inc.'s wholly-owned subsidiaries included pm usa, which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the united states; middleton, which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of pm usa; nat sherman, which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of super premium cigarettes and the sale of premium cigars; and ust, which through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including usstc and ste. michelle, is engaged in the manufacture and sale of smokeless tobacco products and wine. altria group, inc.'s other operating companies included nu mark, a wholly-owned subsidiary that is engaged in the manufacture and sale of innovative tobacco products, and pmcc, a wholly-owned subsidiary that maintains a portfolio of finance assets, substantially all of which are leveraged leases. other altria group, inc. wholly-owned subsidiaries included altria group distribution company, which provides sales and distribution services to certain altria group, inc. operating subsidiaries, and altria client services llc, which provides various support services in areas, such as legal, regulatory, consumer engagement, finance, human resources and external affairs to altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries. in addition, nu mark, middleton and nat sherman use third-party arrangements in the manufacture of their products. altria group, inc.'s access to the operating cash flows of its wholly-owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. at december 31, 2017, altria group, inc.'s principal wholly-owned subsidiaries were not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.
at september 30, 2016, altria group, inc. had an approximate 27% ownership of sabmiller, which altria group, inc. accounted for under the equity method of accounting. in october 2016, legacy ab inbev completed the transaction, and ab inbev became the holding company for the combined sabmiller and legacy ab inbev businesses. upon completion of the transaction, altria group, inc. had a 9.6% ownership of ab inbev based on ab inbev's shares outstanding. subsequently, altria group, inc. purchased approximately 12 million ordinary shares of ab inbev, increasing altria group, inc.'s ownership to approximately 10.2% at december 31, 2016. at december 31, 2017, altria group, inc. had an approximate 10.2% ownership of ab inbev, which altria group, inc. accounts for under the equity method of accounting using a one-quarter lag. as a result of the one-quarter lag and the timing of the completion of the transaction, no earnings from altria group, inc.'s equity investment in ab inbev were recorded for the year ended december 31, 2016. altria group, inc. receives cash dividends on its interest in ab inbev if and when ab inbev pays such dividends. for further discussion, see note 6. investment in ab inbev/sabmiller to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 ("note 6").
altria group, inc.'s reportable segments are smokeable products, smokeless products and wine. the financial services and the innovative tobacco products businesses are included in an all other category due to the continued reduction of the lease portfolio of pmcc and the relative financial contribution of altria group, inc.'s innovative tobacco products businesses to altria group, inc.'s consolidated results.
consolidated results of operations the changes in altria group, inc.'s net earnings and diluted earnings per share ("eps") attributable to altria group, inc. for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the year ended december 31, 2016, were due primarily to the following:

see the discussion of events affecting the comparability of statement of earnings amounts in the consolidated operating results section of the following discussion and analysis.
▪   fewer shares outstanding: fewer shares outstanding during 2017 compared with 2016 were due primarily to shares repurchased by altria group, inc. under its share repurchase program.
▪   change in tax rate: the change in tax rate was driven primarily by no tax being due on the dividends altria group, inc. received from ab inbev during 2017 as a result of a deemed repatriation tax associated with the tax reform act (as defined below). for further discussion, see note 14. income taxes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 ("note 14").
for further details, see the consolidated operating results and operating results by business segment sections of the following discussion and analysis.
2018 forecasted results in february 2018, altria group, inc. forecasted that its 2018 full-year adjusted diluted eps growth rate is expected to be in the range of 15% to 19% over 2017 full-year adjusted diluted eps. this forecasted growth rate excludes the income and expense items in the table below. altria group, inc.'s 2018 guidance reflects investments in focus areas for long-term growth, including innovative product development and launches, regulatory science, brand equity, retail fixtures and future retail concepts. altria group, inc. expects its 2018 full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be in a range of approximately 23% to 24%.
altria group, inc.'s full-year adjusted diluted eps guidance and full-year forecast for its adjusted effective tax rate exclude the impact of certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations. these items may include, for example, loss on early extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges, gain on the transaction, ab inbev/sabmiller special items, certain tax items, charges associated with tobacco and health litigation items, and resolutions of certain non-participating manufacturer ("npm") adjustment disputes under the 1998 master settlement agreement (such dispute resolutions are referred to as "npm adjustment items" and are more fully described in health care cost recovery litigation - npm adjustment disputes in note 18).
altria group, inc.'s management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of certain income and expense items, including those items noted in the preceding paragraph, on altria group, inc.'s reported diluted eps and reported effective tax rate because these items, which could be significant, may be infrequent, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. as a result, altria group, inc. does not provide a corresponding united states generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap") measure for, or reconciliation to, its adjusted diluted eps guidance or its adjusted effective tax rate forecast.
in addition, the factors described in item 1a represent continuing risks to this forecast.

altria group, inc. reports its financial results in accordance with u.s. gaap. altria group, inc.'s management reviews certain financial results, including diluted eps, on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items, including those items noted above. altria group, inc.'s management does not view any of these special items to be part of altria group, inc.'s underlying results as they may be highly variable, may be infrequent, are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results. altria group, inc.'s management also reviews income tax rates on an adjusted basis. altria group, inc.'s adjusted effective tax rate may exclude certain tax items from its reported effective tax rate. altria group, inc.'s management believes that adjusted financial measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results and provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results. adjusted financial measures are used by management and regularly provided to the codm for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets. these adjusted financial measures are not consistent with u.s. gaap and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. these adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap.
discussion and analysis critical accounting policies and estimates note 2 includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria group, inc.'s consolidated financial statements. in most instances, altria group, inc. must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under u.s. gaap.
the preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in altria group, inc.'s consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between altria group, inc.'s estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates, as well as the accounting policies and methods, used in the preparation of altria group, inc.'s consolidated financial statements:
▪consolidation: the consolidated financial statements include altria group, inc., as well as its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. investments in which altria group, inc. has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
▪revenue recognition: altria group, inc.'s businesses recognize revenues, net of sales incentives and sales returns, and including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, upon shipment of goods when title and risk of loss pass to customers. payments received in advance of revenue recognition are deferred and recorded in other accrued liabilities until revenue is recognized. altria group, inc.'s businesses also include excise taxes billed to customers in net revenues. shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales.
▪depreciation, amortization, impairment testing and asset valuation: altria group, inc. depreciates property, plant and equipment and amortizes its definite-lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods up to 25 years, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to 50 years. definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to 25 years.
altria group, inc. reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. altria group, inc. performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. these analyses are affected by general economic conditions and projected growth rates. for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, altria group, inc. groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. if an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. altria group, inc. also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed.
substantially all of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded by altria group, inc. at december 31, 2017 relate to the acquisitions of nat sherman in 2017, green smoke in 2014, ust in 2009 and middleton in 2007. altria group, inc. conducts a required annual review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require altria group, inc. to perform an interim review. if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the implied fair value. if the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value. for substantially all goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values are determined using discounted cash flows.
goodwill by reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets at december 31, 2017 were as follows:
(in millions)           goodwill         indefinite-livedintangible assets cigarettes                   $22                                      $172
during 2017, 2016 and 2015, altria group, inc. completed its quantitative annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and no impairment charges resulted. at december 31, 2017, the estimated fair values of all reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets within those reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values, except for the columbia crest trademark within the wine reporting unit. at december 31, 2017, the fair value of the columbia crest trademark exceeded its book value of $54 million by approximately 9%. results for columbia crest in 2017 were negatively impacted by increased competitive activity and continued trade inventory reductions.
in 2017, altria group, inc. used an income approach to estimate the fair values of substantially all of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. the income approach reflects the discounting of expected future cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the risk-free rate for the use of those funds, the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows. the weighted-average discount rate used in performing the valuations was approximately 9%.
in performing the 2017 discounted cash flow analysis, altria group, inc. made various judgments, estimates and assumptions, the most significant of which were volume, income, growth rates and discount rates. the analysis incorporated assumptions used in altria group, inc.'s long-term financial forecast, which is used by altria group, inc.'s management to evaluate business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to setting employee compensation targets. the assumptions incorporated the highest and best use of altria group, inc.'s indefinite-lived intangible assets and also included perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term financial forecast. the perpetual growth rate used in performing all of the valuations was 2%. fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions, some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of altria group, inc.'s control.
although altria group, inc.'s discounted cash flow analysis is based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information at the time that the discounted cash flow analysis is developed, there is significant judgment used in determining future cash flows. the following factors have the most potential to impact expected future cash flows and, therefore, altria group, inc.'s impairment conclusions: general economic conditions; federal, state and local regulatory developments; category growth rates; consumer preferences; success of planned product expansions; competitive activity; and income and tobacco-related taxes. for further discussion of these factors, see operating results by business segment - tobacco space - business environment below.
while altria group, inc.'s management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset are reasonable, actual performance in the short-term or long-term could be significantly different from forecasted performance, which could result in impairment charges in future periods.
for additional information on goodwill and other intangible assets, see note 3.
▪marketing costs: altria group, inc.'s businesses promote their products with consumer engagement programs, consumer incentives and trade promotions. such programs include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives, event marketing and volume-based incentives. consumer engagement programs are expensed as incurred. consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of revenues, a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers, retailers and consumers at the end of a period, based principally on historical volume, utilization and redemption rates. for interim reporting purposes, consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.
▪contingencies: as discussed in note 18 and item 3, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries, including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries, as well as their respective indemnitees. in 1998, pm usa and certain other u.s. tobacco product manufacturers entered into the 1998 master settlement
agreement (the "msa") with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. pm usa and certain other u.s. tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by mississippi, florida, texas and minnesota (together with the msa, the "state settlement agreements"). pm usa's portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers' domestic cigarette shipments, including roll-your-own cigarettes, in the year preceding that in which the payment is due. in addition, pm usa, middleton, nat sherman and usstc are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the fda as a result of the fsptca. payments under the state settlement agreements and the fda user fees are based on variable factors, such as volume, operating income, market share and inflation, depending on the subject payment. altria group, inc.'s subsidiaries account for the cost of the state settlement agreements and fda user fees as a component of cost of sales. altria group, inc.'s subsidiaries recorded approximately $4.7 billion, $4.9 billion and $4.8 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in connection with the state settlement agreements and fda user fees.
altria group, inc. and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. at the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, except to the extent discussed in note 18 and item 3: (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any. litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and included in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings.
▪employee benefit plans: as discussed in note 16. benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 ("note 16"), altria group, inc. provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees, including pension, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits. altria group, inc. records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s. gaap, which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, mortality, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. altria group, inc. reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods.
altria group, inc. recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet and records as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred income taxes, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings (losses) are subsequently amortized into net periodic benefit cost in future years.
at december 31, 2017, altria group, inc.'s discount rate assumptions for its pension and postretirement plans obligations decreased from 4.1% to 3.7% at december 31, 2017. altria group, inc. presently anticipates an increase of approximately $30 million in its 2018 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense versus 2017, excluding amounts in each year related to termination, settlement and curtailment. this anticipated increase is due primarily to higher amortization of unrecognized losses, driven by the impact of lower discount rates, partially offset by the expected return on postretirement assets resulting from the december 2017 $270 million contribution to fund certain postretirement benefits. assuming no change to the shape of the yield curve, a 50 basis point decrease in altria group, inc.'s discount rates would increase altria group, inc.'s pension and postretirement expense by approximately $53 million, and a 50 basis point increase in altria group, inc.'s discount rates would decrease altria group, inc.'s pension and postretirement expense by approximately $49 million. similarly, a 50 basis point decrease (increase) in the expected return on plan assets would increase (decrease) altria group, inc.'s pension and postretirement expense by approximately $38 million. see note 16 for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates.
▪income taxes: significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. altria group, inc.'s deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. altria group, inc. records a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
altria group, inc. recognizes a benefit for uncertain tax positions when a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. altria group, inc. recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in its consolidated statements of earnings.
altria group, inc. recognized income tax benefits and charges in the consolidated statements of earnings during 2017, 2016 and 2015 as a result of various tax events, including the impact of the tax reform act (as defined below).
on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax reform act"). the main provisions of the tax reform act that impact altria group, inc. include: (i) a reduction in the u.s. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018, and (ii) changes in the treatment of foreign-source income, commonly referred to as a modified territorial tax system.
the transition to a modified territorial tax system required altria group, inc. to record a deemed repatriation tax and an associated tax basis benefit in 2017. the tax impact related to the tax basis benefit and the deemed repatriation tax was based on provisional estimates as of january 18, 2018, substantially all of which were related to altria group, inc.'s share of ab inbev's accumulated earnings and associated taxes. altria group, inc. may be required to adjust these provisional estimates based on (i) additional guidance related to, or interpretation of, the tax reform act and associated tax laws and (ii) additional information to be received from ab inbev, including information regarding ab inbev's accumulated earnings and associated taxes for the 2016 and 2017 tax years. this additional guidance and information could result in increases or decreases to the provisional estimates, which may be significant in relation to these estimates. altria group, inc. will record any such adjustments in 2018.
for additional information on income taxes, see note 14.

as discussed further in note 15, the codm reviews operating companies income to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, the segments. operating companies income for the segments is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles. management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze the business performance and trends of the various business segments.
the following events that occurred during 2017, 2016 and 2015 affected the comparability of statement of earnings amounts.
▪gain on ab inbev/sabmiller business combination: for the year ended december 31, 2017, altria group, inc. recorded pre-tax gains of $445 million related to the planned completion of the remaining ab inbev divestitures of certain sabmiller assets and businesses in connection with legacy ab inbev obtaining necessary regulatory clearances for the transaction. as a result of the transaction, for the year ended december 31, 2016, altria group, inc. recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $13.9 billion. for further discussion, see note 6.
▪npm adjustment items:  for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, pre-tax expense (income) for npm adjustment items was recorded in altria group, inc.'s consolidated statements of earnings as follows:
the amounts shown in the table above for the smokeable products segment were recorded by pm usa as increases (reductions) to costs of sales, which decreased (increased) operating companies income in the smokeable products segment. for further discussion, see health care cost recovery litigation - npm adjustment disputes in note 18.
▪tobacco and health litigation items: for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, pre-tax charges related to certain tobacco and health litigations items were recorded in altria group, inc.'s consolidated statements of earnings as follows:
during 2017, pm usa recorded pre-tax charges of $72 million in marketing, administration and research costs and $8 million in interest costs, substantially all of which related to 11 engle progeny cases.
during 2016, pm usa recorded pre-tax charges of $88 million in marketing, administration and research costs, primarily
related to settlements in the miner and aspinall cases totaling approximately $67 million and $16 million related to a judgment in the merino case. in addition, during 2016, pm usa recorded $17 million in interest costs primarily related to aspinall.
during 2015, pm usa recorded pre-tax charges in marketing, administration and research costs in seven state engle progeny cases and schwarz of $59 million and $25 million, respectively, as well as $14 million and $9 million, respectively, in interest costs related to these cases. additionally in 2015, pm usa and certain other cigarette manufacturers reached an agreement to resolve approximately 415 pending federal engle progeny cases. as a result of the agreement, pm usa recorded a pre-tax provision of approximately $43 million in marketing, administration and research costs.
for further discussion, see note 18.
▪settlement for lump sum pension payments: in the third quarter of 2017, altria group, inc. made a voluntary, limited-time offer to former employees with vested benefits in the altria retirement plan who had not commenced receiving benefit payments and who met certain other conditions. eligible participants were offered the opportunity to make a one-time election to receive their pension benefit as a single lump sum payment or as a monthly annuity. as a result of the 2017 lump sum distributions, a one-time pre-tax settlement charge of $81 million was recorded in 2017 in altria group, inc.'s consolidated statement of earnings as follows:
for the year ended december 31, 2017

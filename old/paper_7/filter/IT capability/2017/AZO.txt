item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are the nations leading retailer, and a leading distributor, of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the united states. we began operations in 1979 and at august 26, 2017, operated 5,465 autozone stores in the united states, including puerto rico; 524 stores in mexico; 14 stores in brazil; and 26 imc branches. each autozone store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products. at august 26, 2017, in 4,592 of our domestic autozone stores, we also had a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, service stations and public sector accounts. we also have commercial programs in autozone stores in mexico and brazil. imc branches carry an extensive line of original equipment quality import replacement parts. we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through www.alldata.com and www.alldatadiy.com. additionally, we sell automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products through www.autozone.com, and accessories, performance and replacement parts through www.autoanything.com, and our commercial customers can make purchases through www.autozonepro.com and www.imcparts.net. we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services.
executive summary for fiscal 2017, we achieved record net income of $1.281 billion, a 3.2% increase over the prior year, and sales growth of $253.0 million, a 2.4% increase over the prior year. both our retail sales and commercial sales grew this past year, as we continue to make progress on our initiatives that are aimed at improving our ability to say yes to our customers more frequently, drive traffic to our stores and accelerate our commercial growth.
our business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumer and our industry, including but not limited to fuel costs, wage rates, and other economic conditions. given the nature of these macroeconomic factors, we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue, nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future.
one macroeconomic factor affecting our customers and our industry during fiscal 2017 was gas prices. during fiscal 2017, the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the united states was $2.31 per gallon, compared to $2.14 per gallon during fiscal 2016. we believe fluctuations in gas prices impact our customers level of disposable income. with approximately 12 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumption each month across the u.s., each $1 increase at the pump reduces approximately $12 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month. given the unpredictability of gas prices, we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease, nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods.
we have also experienced accelerated pressure on wages in the united states during fiscal 2017. some of this is attributed to regulatory changes in certain states and municipalities, while the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures with lower unemployment rates and some specific actions taken in recent years by other retailers. the regulatory changes are going to continue, as evidenced by the areas that have passed legislation to increase their wages substantially over the next few years, but we are still assessing to what degree these changes will impact our earnings growth in future periods.
during fiscal 2017, failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix, at approximately 84% of total sales, with failure related categories continuing to be our largest set of categories. while we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years, in our domestic stores we did experience a slight increase in mix of sales of the failure category as compared to last year. we believe the improvement in this sales category was driven by differences in regional weather patterns and improved merchandise assortments due to the products we have added over the last year. our sales mix can be impacted by severe or unusual weather over a short term period. over the long term, we believe the impact of the weather on our sales mix is not significant.
our primary response to fluctuations in the demand for the products we sell is to adjust our advertising message, store staffing, and product assortment. in recent years, we initiated a variety of strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability in our domestic stores. as part of those tests, we closely studied our hub distribution model, store inventory levels and product assortment, which led to strategic tests on increased frequency of delivery to our domestic stores and significantly expanding parts and assortment in select domestic stores we call mega hubs. during fiscal 2015, we concluded our tests on these specific new concepts. during fiscal 2016 and most of fiscal 2017, we continued the implementation of more frequent deliveries from our distribution centers to additional domestic stores and the execution of our mega hub strategy. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, however, we made substantial changes to test different scenarios to determine the optimal approach around increased delivery frequency. we expect to conclude this test in fiscal 2018.
miles driven we believe that as the number of miles driven increases, consumers vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance, resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items. while over the long-term we have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven, we have also seen certain time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven. during the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven, we believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors, including the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road. since the beginning of the fiscal year and through june 2017 (latest publicly available information), miles driven in the u.s. increased by 1.2% compared to the same period in the prior year.
according to the latest data provided by the auto care association, as of january 1, 2017, the average age of vehicles on the road is 11.7 years as compared to 11.6 years as of january 1, 2016. although the average age of vehicles continues to increase, it is increasing at a decelerated rate primarily driven by the improvement in new car sales in recent years. however, in the near term, we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money. as the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases, we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell.
results of operations fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016
for the fiscal year ended august 26, 2017, we reported net sales of $10.889 billion compared with $10.636 billion for the year ended august 27, 2016, a 2.4% increase from fiscal 2016. this growth was driven primarily by net sales of $172.5 million from new domestic autozone stores and domestic same store sales increase of 0.5%. domestic commercial sales increased $110.9 million, or 5.7%, over domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2016.
at august 26, 2017, we operated 5,465 domestic autozone stores, 524 in mexico, 14 in brazil, and 26 imc branches compared with 5,297 domestic autozone stores, 483 in mexico, eight in brazil, and 26 imc branches at august 27, 2016. we reported a total auto parts (domestic, mexico, brazil, and imc) sales increase of 2.6% for fiscal 2017.
gross profit for fiscal 2017 was $5.740 billion, or 52.7% of net sales, a 2 basis point decrease compared with $5.609 billion, or 52.7% of net sales for fiscal 2016. the slight decline in gross margin was attributable to higher supply chain costs (-20 basis points) associated with current year inventory initiatives, partially offset by higher merchandise margins.
interest expense, net for fiscal 2017 was $154.6 million compared with $147.7 million during fiscal 2016. this increase was primarily due to higher borrowing levels and borrowing rates. average borrowings for fiscal 2017 were $5.070 billion, compared with $4.860 billion for fiscal 2016, and weighted average borrowing rates were 2.8% for fiscal 2017, compared to 2.7% for fiscal 2016.
net income for fiscal 2017 increased by 3.2% to $1.281 billion, and diluted earnings per share increased 8.3% to $44.07 from $40.70 in fiscal 2016. the companys adoption of the new accounting guidance for share-based payments increased earnings per share by $0.81, driven by a lower effective tax rate of 162 basis points, (a $1.08 benefit to earnings per share), partially offset by a change to the dilutive outstanding shares calculations (a $0.27 reduction to earnings per share). excluding the $0.81 net benefit for the year from the adoption of this new standard, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 6.3% to $43.26. we believe that adjusted diluted earnings per share provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business by excluding the tax effects of option exercise activity. we use adjusted diluted earnings per share to evaluate period-over-period operating performance because we believe it provides a more comparable measure of our continuing business by adjusting for items that are not reflective of the normal earnings of our business. this measure may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business. refer to the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures section for further details of our calculation.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015
for the fiscal year ended august 27, 2016, we reported net sales of $10.636 billion compared with $10.187 billion for the year ended august 29, 2015, a 4.4% increase from fiscal 2015. this growth was driven primarily by domestic same store sales increase of 2.4% and net sales of $177.0 million from new domestic autozone stores. domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2016 increased $129.8 million, or 7.1%, over domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2015.
at august 27, 2016, we operated 5,297 domestic autozone stores, 483 in mexico, eight in brazil and 26 imc branches compared with 5,141 domestic autozone stores, 441 in mexico, seven in brazil and 20 imc branches at august 29, 2015. we reported a total auto parts (domestic, mexico, brazil and imc) sales increase of 4.4% for fiscal 2016.
gross profit for fiscal 2016 was $5.609 billion, or 52.7% of net sales, compared with $5.327 billion, or 52.3% of net sales for fiscal 2015. the improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs, partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives (18 basis points).
interest expense, net for fiscal 2016 was $147.7 million compared with $150.4 million during fiscal 2015. this decrease was primarily due to a decline in borrowing rates, partially offset by higher borrowing levels over the comparable year period. average borrowings for fiscal 2016 were $4.860 billion, compared with $4.520 billion for fiscal 2015 and weighted average borrowing rates were 2.7% for fiscal 2016, compared to 3.0% for fiscal 2015.
our effective income tax rate was 35.1% of pre-tax income for fiscal 2016 compared to 35.6% for fiscal 2015. the decrease in the effective income tax rate was driven by a discrete tax item during fiscal 2016.
seasonality and quarterly periods our business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of february through september, in which average weekly per-store sales historically have been about 15% to 20% higher than in the slower months of december and january. during short periods of time, a stores sales can be affected by weather conditions. extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail; thereby increasing sales of seasonal products. mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales, as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance is deferred during periods of rainy weather. over the longer term, the effects of weather balance out, as we have locations throughout the united states, puerto rico, mexico and brazil.
each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks, and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2017, 2016 and 2015. because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 weeks, compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters, our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income. the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 represented 32.3% of annual sales and 33.9% of net income; the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 represented 32.0% of annual sales and 34.4% of net income; and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 represented 32.3% of annual sales and 34.6% of net income.
liquidity and capital resources the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts, products and accessories. net cash provided by operating activities was $1.571 billion in 2017, $1.641 billion in 2016, and $1.573 billion in fiscal 2015. cash flows from operations are unfavorable compared to last year primarily due to timing of payment of accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by growth in net income and a decrease in pension contributions.
our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued new-location development program and the building of new distribution centers. from the beginning of fiscal 2015 to august 26, 2017, we have opened 622 new locations. we opened two distribution centers in fiscal 2017 and currently have one additional distribution center under development. net cash flows used in investing activities were $553.6 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $505.8 million in fiscal 2016 and $567.9 million in fiscal 2015. we invested $553.8 million in capital assets in fiscal 2017, compared to $488.8 million in fiscal 2016 and $480.6 million in fiscal 2015. the increase in capital expenditures during this time was primarily attributable to the building of the new distribution centers and increased investment in our existing locations. we had new location openings of 215 for fiscal 2017, 205 for fiscal 2016, and 202 for fiscal 2015. cash flows used in the acquisition of imc were $75.7 million in fiscal 2015. cash flows were also used in the purchase of other intangibles for $10 million in each of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. we invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities. we purchased $85.7 million in marketable securities in fiscal 2017, $130.2 million in fiscal 2016 and $49.7 million in fiscal 2015. we had proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $83.0 million in fiscal 2017, $120.5 million in fiscal 2016 and $46.4 million in fiscal 2015.
net cash used in financing activities was $914.3 million in 2017, $1.117 billion in 2016 and $944.6 million in fiscal 2015. the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled $1.072 billion for fiscal 2017, $1.452 billion for fiscal 2016 and $1.271 billion for fiscal 2015. the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were primarily funded by cash flows from operations and by increases in debt levels. proceeds from issuance of debt were $600 million for fiscal 2017 and $650 million for each of fiscal 2016 and 2015. in fiscal 2017, the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings, which were used to repay the $400 million senior notes due in january 2017. in fiscal 2016, the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for general corporate purposes, including for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, store openings and stock repurchases. in fiscal 2015, the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings, which were used to repay the $500 million 5.750% senior notes due january 2015 and for the acquisition of imc. we used commercial paper borrowings to repay the $300 million senior notes due in november 2015 and the $200 million senior notes due in june 2016. in 2017, we made net repayments of commercial paper and short-term borrowings in the amount of $42.4 million. net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and short-term borrowings for fiscal 2016 and 2015 were $149.9 million and $153.8 million, respectively.
during fiscal 2018, we expect to invest in our business at a decreased rate as compared to fiscal 2017, as fiscal 2017 included significant investment for the building of new distribution centers. our investments are expected to be directed primarily to new locations, supply chain infrastructure, enhancements to existing locations and investments in technology. the amount of our investments in our new locations is impacted by different factors, including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased (requiring higher investment) or leased (generally lower investment), located in the united states, mexico or brazil, or located in urban or rural areas. during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, our capital expenditures have increased by approximately 13%, 2%, and 10%, respectively, as compared to the prior year.
in addition to the building and land costs, our new locations require working capital, predominantly for inventories. historically, we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers, reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio. we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases; however, our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors capacity to factor their receivables from us. certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their receivables from us, allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate. in recent years, we initiated a variety of strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability, which increased our inventory per location. many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortments
depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments (either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions), we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures, working capital requirements and stock repurchases. the balance may be funded through new borrowings. we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past.
our cash balances are held in various locations around the world. as of august 26, 2017, and august 27, 2016, cash and cash equivalents of $148.4 million and $78.1 million, respectively, were held outside of the u.s. and were generally utilized to support liquidity needs in our foreign operations. we intend to continue to permanently reinvest the cash held outside of the u.s. in our foreign operations.
for the fiscal year ended august 26, 2017, our after-tax return on invested capital (roic) was 29.9% as compared to 31.3% for the comparable prior year period. roic is calculated as after-tax operating profit (excluding rent charges) divided by invested capital (which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases). the decrease in roic is primarily due to the increase in average debt, along with the impact of recent investments in the business. currently, these investments are diluting our return metrics. we use roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance. refer to the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures section for further details of our calculation.
debt facilities on november 18, 2016, we amended and restated our existing multi-year revolving credit facility (the new multi-year revolving credit agreement) by increasing the committed credit amount from $1.25 billion to $1.6 billion, extending the expiration date by two years and renegotiating other terms and conditions. this credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings, letters of credit and other short-term unsecured bank loans. the capacity of the credit facility may be increased to $2.1 billion prior to the maturity date at our election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval, and may include up to $200 million in letters of credit. under the revolving credit facility, we may borrow funds consisting of eurodollar loans, base rate loans or a combination of both. interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate, defined as libor plus the applicable percentage, as defined in the revolving credit facility, depending upon our senior, unsecured, (non-credit enhanced) long-term debt rating. interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the credit facility. we also have the option to borrow funds under the terms of a swingline loan subfacility. the revolving credit facility expires on november 18, 2021, but we may, by notice to the administrative agent, make up to two requests to extend the termination date for an additional period of one year. the first such request must be made no earlier than 60 days, and no later than 45 days, prior to november 18, 2017, while the second request must be made no earlier than 60 days, and no later than 45 days, prior to november 18, 2018.
on november 18, 2016, we amended and restated our existing 364-day revolving credit facility (the new 364-day credit agreement) by decreasing the committed credit amount from $500 million to $400 million, extending the expiration date by one year and renegotiating other terms and conditions. the credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings and other short-term unsecured bank loans. under the credit facility, we may borrow funds consisting of eurodollar loans, base rate loans or a combination of both. interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate, defined as libor plus the applicable margin, as defined in the revolving credit facility, depending upon our senior, unsecured, (non-credit enhanced) long-term debt rating. interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the credit facility. the new 364-day credit agreement expires on november 17, 2017, but we may request an extension of the term date for 364 days no later than 45 days prior to november 17, 2017, subject to bank approval. in addition, at least 15 days prior to november 17, 2017, we have the right to convert the credit facility to a term loan for up to one year from the termination date, subject to a 1% penalty.
as of august 26, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings under either of the revolving credit facilities and $3.3 million of outstanding letters of credit under the new multi-year revolving credit agreement.
the revolving credit facility agreements require that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 2.5:1. this ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) consolidated earnings before interest, taxes and rents to (ii) consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents. our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august 26, 2017 was 6.0:1.
as of august 26, 2017, $1.155 billion of commercial paper borrowings and the $250 million 7.125% senior notes due august 2018 were classified as long-term in the consolidated balance sheets as we have the ability and intent to refinance on a long-term basis through available capacity in our revolving credit facilities. as of august 26, 2017, we had $1.997 billion of availability under our $2.0 billion revolving credit facilities, which would allow us to replace these short-term obligations with long-term financing facilities.
we also maintain a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of $75 million. the letter of credit facility is in addition to the letters of credit that may be issued under the new multi-year revolving credit agreement. as of august 26, 2017 we had $74.9 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility, which expires june 2019.
in addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facilities discussed above, we had $10.4 million in letters of credit outstanding as of august 26, 2017. these letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis. on april 18, 2017, we issued $600 million in 3.750% senior notes due june 2027 under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on april 15, 2015 (the 2015 shelf registration). the 2015 shelf registration allows us to sell an indeterminate amount of debt securities to fund general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital, capital expenditures, new location openings, stock repurchases and acquisitions. proceeds from the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes.
all senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the senior notes are downgraded (as defined in the agreements). further, the senior notes contain a provision that repayment of the senior notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control (as defined in the agreements). our borrowings under our senior notes contain minimal covenants, primarily restrictions on liens. under our revolving credit facilities, covenants include restrictions on liens, a maximum debt to earnings ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances. all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs.
as of august 26, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future.
for the fiscal year ended august 26, 2017, our adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share-based compensation expense (ebitdar) ratio was 2.6:1 as compared to 2.5:1 as of the comparable prior year end. we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt, capital lease obligations and rent times six; and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share-based compensation expense to net income. we target our debt levels to a specified ratio of adjusted debt to
ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings and believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels. to the extent ebitdar continues to grow in future years, we expect our debt levels to increase; conversely, if ebitdar declines, we would expect our debt levels to decrease. refer to the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures section for further details of our calculation.
stock repurchases during 1998, we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors (the board). on march 21, 2017, the board voted to increase the authorization by $750 million to raise the cumulative share repurchase authorization from $17.9 billion to $18.65 billion. from january 1998 to august 26, 2017, we have repurchased a total of 142.3 million shares at an aggregate cost of $17.826 billion. we repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.072 billion during fiscal 2017, 1.9 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.452 billion during fiscal 2016, and 2.0 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.271 billion during fiscal 2015. considering cumulative repurchases as of august 26, 2017, we had $823.7 million remaining under the boards authorization to repurchase our common stock.
for the fiscal year ended august 26, 2017, cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt was $1.018 billion as compared to $1.167 billion during the comparable prior year period. cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt is calculated as the net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents less increases in debt plus share repurchases. we use cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt to calculate the cash flows remaining and available in an effort to increase shareholder value in the form of share repurchases. we believe this is important information regarding our allocation of available capital where we prioritize investments in the business and utilize the remaining funds to repurchase shares, while maintaining debt levels that support our investment grade credit ratings. if we allowed these funds to accumulate on our balance sheet instead of repurchasing our shares, we believe our earnings per share and stock price would be negatively impacted. refer to the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures section for further details of our calculation.
financial commitments the following table shows our significant contractual obligations as of august 26, 2017:
capital leases(4)                      159,076            48,134                    86,418                     24,524                         
construction commitments                69,914            69,914                                                                            
(1)   debt balances represent principal maturities, excluding interest, discounts, and debt issuance costs.
(3)   operating lease obligations are inclusive of amounts accrued within deferred rent and closed store obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.
(4)   capital lease obligations include related interest.
(5)   self-insurance reserves reflect estimates based on actuarial calculations. although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities, the timing of future payments are predictable based upon historical patterns.
we have pension obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities and the nature of the account. during fiscal 2017, we made contributions of $17.8 million to the pension plan. we expect to make contributions of approximately $20.3 million during fiscal 2018; however a change to the expected cash funding may be impacted by a change in interest rates or a change in the actual or expected return on plan assets.
as of august 26, 2017, our defined benefit obligation associated with our pension plans is $314.7 million and our pension assets are valued at $316.3 million, resulting in a net pension asset position of $1.5 million. amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are $118.9 million at august 26, 2017. the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be amortized into pension expense in the future, unless the losses are recovered in future periods through actuarial gains.
additionally, our tax liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, was $15.4 million at august 26, 2017. approximately $2.6 million is classified as current liabilities and $12.8 million is classified as long-term liabilities. we did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments of the long-term liabilities due to uncertainties in the timing and amounts of the settlement of these tax positions.
off-balance sheet arrangements the following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august 26, 2017:
(in thousands)                       total other commitments standby letters of credit          $88,633
a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers compensation carriers.
there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. the standby letters of credit and surety bond arrangements expire within one year, but have automatic renewal clauses.
selected financial data and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). these non-gaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders value.
non-gaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. however, we have presented the non-gaap financial measures, as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative year-to-year operating results. furthermore, our management and compensation committee of the board use the above-mentioned non-gaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and use select measurements to determine payments of performance-based compensation. we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following reconciliation tables.

critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions.
our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board. the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management:
inventory reserves and cost of sales lifo we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market. inventory cost has been determined using the last-in, first-out (lifo) method for domestic inventories and the weighted average cost method for mexico and brazil inventories. due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases, we have exhausted our lifo reserve balance. our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost, which is based on average cost. the difference between lifo cost and replacement cost, which will be reduced upon experiencing price inflation on our merchandise purchases, was $414.9 million at august 26, 2017.
inventory obsolescence and shrinkage our inventory, primarily hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products, is used on vehicles that have rather long lives; and therefore, the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit. in the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs, we record a charge (less than $3 million in each of the last three years) through cost of sales for the difference. these charges are based on managements judgment, including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods.
historically, we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory, nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates. however, we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns.
additionally, we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage, which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories. shrinkage may occur due to theft, loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods, among other things. throughout the year, we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates. we make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results.
based on our vendor agreements, a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is earned as we purchase inventory. therefore, we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory. during the year, we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations. we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have not experienced significant losses and typically have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them. historically, we have had write-offs less than $1 million in each of the last three years.
goodwill and intangibles we evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values exceed the current fair values. we evaluate the likelihood of impairment by considering qualitative factors, such as macroeconomic, industry, market, or any other factors that could impact the reporting units fair value. if these factors indicate impairment, we perform a quantitative assessment to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and involves valuation methods including forecasting future financial performance, estimates of discount rates and other factors. if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment loss.
indefinite-lived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss. these impairment analyses require a significant amount of subjective judgment by management, and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual results may be different from our estimates.
the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles at august 26, 2017 and august 27, 2016 was $418.8 million with $302.6 million related to our domestic auto parts reporting unit, $89.8 million relating to our autoanything reporting unit and $26.4 million relating to our interamerican motor corporation reporting unit. no impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 as the fair value of our reporting units exceeded our carrying values. if profitability trends do not improve as projected during fiscal 2018 for our autoanything and interamerican motor corporation reporting units, it is possible that an interim test, or our annual impairment test, may result in an impairment of these assets.
self-insurance reserves we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation, employee health, general and products liability, property and vehicle liability; and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks. our self-insurance reserve estimates totaled $220.5 million at august 26, 2017, and $214.4 million at august 27, 2016. this change is primarily reflective of our growing operations, including inflation, increases in health care costs, the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked, as well as our historical claims experience.
the assumptions made by management in estimating our self-insurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience, judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels. we utilize various methods, including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods, to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported. the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. when estimating these liabilities, we consider factors, such as the severity, duration and frequency of claims, legal costs associated with claims, healthcare trends, and projected inflation of related factors. in recent history, our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent, and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates. as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred, we will adjust our reserves accordingly.
management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self- insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks. arriving at these estimates, however, requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management, and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates. for example, changes in our assumptions about health care costs, the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness, the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates, causing our reserves to be overstated or understated. for instance, a 10% change in our self-insurance liability would have affected net income by approximately $14.7 million for fiscal 2017.
our liabilities for workers compensation, certain general and product liability, property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities; however, the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities. accordingly, we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be long-term using the risk-free interest rate as of the balance sheet date. if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 50 basis points, net income would have been affected by approximately $2.1 million for fiscal 2017. our liability for health benefits is classified as current, as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks.
income taxes our income tax returns are audited by state, federal and foreign tax authorities, and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time. tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate. the contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits, changes in tax laws, litigation, appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions. we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded. as of august 26, 2017, we had approximately $15.4 million reserved for uncertain tax positions.
we evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.
we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years; however, actual results could differ from our estimates, and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. specifically, management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions. additionally, to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or must pay in excess of recognized reserves, our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected.
pension obligation prior to january 1, 2003, substantially all full-time employees were covered by a qualified defined benefit pension plan. the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employees highest consecutive five-year average compensation. on january 1, 2003, the plan was frozen. accordingly, pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan. on january 1, 2003, our supplemental, unqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen. accordingly, plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan. as the plan benefits are frozen, the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels or additional years of service, but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances:
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets: for the fiscal year ended august 26, 2017, we have assumed a 7.0% long-term rate of return on our plan assets. this estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio, our historical long-term investment performance and current market conditions. we review the expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis, and revise it accordingly. additionally, we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our long-term strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets. in january 2017, our investment committee approved a revised asset allocation target for the investments held by the pension plan. based on the revised asset allocation target, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets changed from 7.0% for the year ended august 26, 2017, to 6.0% for the year ending august 25, 2018. at august 26, 2017, our plan assets totaled $316.3 million in our qualified plan. our assets are generally valued using the net asset values, which are determined by valuing investments at the closing price or last trade reported on such date on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. we have no assets in our nonqualified plan. a 50 basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expense by approximately $1.6 million for the qualified plan.
discount rate used to determine benefit obligations: this rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term, high-quality, corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. for fiscal 2017, we assumed a discount rate of 3.9%. a decrease in the discount rate increases our projected benefit obligation and pension expense. a 50 basis point change in the discount rate at august 26, 2017 would impact annual pension expense/income by approximately $1.7 million for the qualified plan and $30 thousand for the nonqualified plan.

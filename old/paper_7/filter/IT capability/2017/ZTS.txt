item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
introduction our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is provided to assist readers in understanding our performance, as reflected in the results of our operations, our financial condition and our cash flows. this md&a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. the discussion in this md&a contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. our future results could differ materially from historical performance and from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors such as those discussed in item 1a. risk factors and forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results sections of this md&a.
overview of our business we are a global leader in the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of animal health medicines and vaccines, with a focus on both livestock and companion animals. for more than 60 years we have been committed to enhancing the health of animals and bringing solutions to our customers who raise and care for them.
we manage our operations through two geographic operating segments: the united states (u.s.) and international. within each of these operating segments, we offer a diversified product portfolio for both livestock and companion animal customers in order to capitalize on local and regional trends and customer needs. see notes to consolidated financial statements-note 18. segment, geographic and other revenue information.
we directly market our products to veterinarians and livestock producers located in approximately 45 countries across north america, europe, africa, asia, australia and south america, and are a market leader in nearly all of the major regions in which we operate. through our efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets, such as brazil, china and mexico, we believe we are the largest animal health medicines and vaccines business as measured by revenue across emerging markets as a whole. in markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence, we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products.
we believe our investments in one of the industry's largest sales organizations, including our extensive network of technical and veterinary operations specialists, our high-quality manufacturing and reliability of supply, and our long track record of developing products that meet customer needs, has led to enduring and valued relationships with our customers. our research and development (r&d) efforts enable us to deliver innovative products to address unmet needs and evolve our product lines so they remain relevant for our customers. additionally, our management team's focus on improving operational and cost efficiencies increases the likelihood of achieving our core growth strategies and enhancing long-term value for our shareholders.
a summary of our 2017 performance compared with the comparable 2016 and 2015 periods follows:
•   increasing demand for improved nutrition, particularly animal protein;
•   natural resource constraints, such as scarcity of arable land, fresh water and increased competition for cultivated land, resulting in fewer resources that will be available to meet this increased demand for animal protein;
•   increased focus on food safety and food security.
product development initiatives our future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products, including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition. we believe we are an industry leader in animal health r&d, with a track record of generating new products and product lifecycle innovation. the majority of our r&d programs focus on product lifecycle innovation, which is defined as r&d programs that leverage existing animal health products by adding new species or claims, achieving approvals in new markets or creating new combinations and reformulations.
perceptions of product quality, safety and reliability we believe that animal health customers value high-quality manufacturing and reliability of supply. the importance of quality and safety concerns to pet owners, veterinarians and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty, which we believe often continues after the loss of patent-based and regulatory exclusivity. we depend on positive perceptions of the safety and quality of our products by our customers, veterinarians and end-users.
in addition, negative beliefs about animal health products generally could impact demand for our products. for example, the issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from food-producing animals to human pathogens, and the causality of that transfer, continue to be the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion. antibacterials refer to small molecules that can be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and are a sub-categorization of the products that make up our anti-infectives and medicated feed additives portfolios. in some countries, this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some food-producing animals, regardless of the route of administration (in feed or injectable). these restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty. our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017.
we cannot predict whether antibacterial resistance concerns will result in additional restrictions or bans, expanded regulations, public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in food-producing animals or increased consumer preference for antibiotic-free protein.
the overall economic environment in addition to industry-specific factors, we, like other businesses, face challenges related to global economic conditions. growth in both the livestock and companion animal sectors is driven by overall economic development and related growth, particularly in many emerging markets. in recent years, certain of our customers and suppliers have been affected directly by economic downturns, which decreased the demand for our products and, in some cases, hindered our ability to collect amounts due from customers.
the cost of medicines and vaccines to our livestock producer customers is small relative to other production costs, including feed, and the use of these products is intended to improve livestock producers' economic outcomes. as a result, demand for our products has historically been more stable than demand for other production inputs. similarly, industry sources have reported that pet owners indicated a preference for reducing spending on other aspects of their lifestyle, including entertainment, clothing and household goods, before reducing spending on pet care. while these factors have mitigated the impact of recent downturns in the global economy, further economic challenges could increase cost sensitivity among our customers, which may result in reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
competition the animal health industry is competitive. although our business is the largest by revenue in the animal health medicines and vaccines industry, we face competition in the regions in which we operate. principal methods of competition vary depending on the particular region, species, product category or individual product. some of these methods include new product development, quality, price, service and promotion to veterinary professionals, pet owners and livestock producers. our competitors include the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies and specialty animal health businesses. in recent years, there has been an increase in consolidation in the animal health industry. there are also several new start-up companies working in the animal health area. in addition to competition from established market participants, there could be new entrants to the animal health medicines and vaccines industry in the future. in certain markets, we also compete with companies that produce generic products, but the level of competition from generic products varies from market to market. for example, the level of generic competition is higher in europe and certain emerging markets than in the united states.
weather conditions and the availability of natural resources the animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by weather conditions, as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and weather-related pressures from pests, such as ticks. as a result, we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations.
in addition, veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to the animals under their care. veterinarians' patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience prolonged snow, ice or other severe weather conditions, particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather. furthermore, livestock producers depend on the availability of natural resources, including large supplies of fresh water. their animals' health and their ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience a shortage of fresh water due to human population growth or floods, droughts or other weather conditions. in the event of adverse weather conditions or a shortage of fresh water, veterinarians and livestock producers may purchase less of our products.
for example, drought conditions could negatively impact, among other things, the supply of corn and the availability of grazing pastures. a decrease in harvested corn results in higher corn prices, which could negatively impact the profitability of livestock producers of cattle, pork and poultry. higher corn prices and reduced availability of grazing pastures contribute to reductions in herd or flock sizes that in turn result in less spending on animal health products. as such, a prolonged drought could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. factors
influencing the magnitude and timing of effects of a drought on our performance include, but may not be limited to, weather patterns and herd management decisions.
disease outbreaks sales of our livestock products could be adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals. outbreaks of disease may reduce regional or global sales of particular animal-derived food products or result in reduced exports of such products, either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions, which may reduce demand for our products. also, the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. alternatively, sales of products that treat specific disease outbreaks may increase.
manufacturing and supply in order to sell our products, we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities. many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are sole-sourced from certain manufacturing sites. minor deviations in our manufacturing or logistical processes, such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing, could result in delays, inventory shortages, unanticipated costs, product recalls, product liability and/or regulatory action. in addition, a number of factors could cause production interruptions that could result in launch delays, inventory shortages, recalls, unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties.
our manufacturing network may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes. the unpredictability of a product's regulatory or commercial success or failure, the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites, and shifting customer demand increase the potential for capacity imbalances.
foreign exchange rates significant portions of our revenue and costs are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. our products are sold in more than 100 countries and, as a result, our revenue is influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates. for the year ended december 31, 2017, approximately 47% of our revenue was denominated in foreign currencies. we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk, in part, through operational means, including managing same-currency revenue in relation to same-currency costs and same-currency assets in relation to same-currency liabilities. as we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the australian dollar, brazilian real, canadian dollar, chinese yuan, euro, u.k. pound and other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the u.s. dollar will impact our revenue, cost of goods and expenses, and consequently, net income. exchange rate fluctuations may also have an impact beyond our reported financial results and directly impact operations. these fluctuations may affect the ability to buy and sell our goods and services between markets impacted by significant exchange rate variances. for the year ended december 31, 2017, approximately 53% of our total revenue was in u.s. dollars. our year-over-year revenue growth was favorably impacted by 1% from changes in foreign currency values relative to the u.s. dollar.
in 2015, we recorded a net remeasurement loss of $89 million on bolivar-denominated net monetary assets, primarily related to cash deposits in venezuela. this loss was recorded as a result of our evaluation of evolving economic conditions in venezuela, including the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar in 2013 and the subsequent changes to venezuela's foreign currency exchange mechanisms, in addition to our expectation of venezuela's responses to changes in its economy, and continued volatility.
operational efficiency program and supply network strategy during 2015, we launched a comprehensive operational efficiency program, which was incremental to the previously announced supply network strategy. these initiatives have focused on reducing complexity in our product portfolios through the elimination of approximately 5,000 product stock keeping units (skus), changing our selling approach in certain markets, reducing our presence in certain countries, and planning to sell or exit 10 manufacturing sites over a long term period. as of december 31, 2017, we divested or exited three u.s. manufacturing sites, four international manufacturing sites, and our 55 percent ownership share of a taiwan joint venture, inclusive of its related manufacturing site. we are also continuing to optimize our resource allocation and efficiency by reducing resources associated with non-customer facing activities and operating more efficiently as a result of less internal complexity and more standardization of processes.
as part of these initiatives, we planned to reduce certain positions through divestitures, normal attrition and involuntary terminations by approximately 2,000 to 2,500, subject to consultations with works councils and unions in certain countries. in 2016, the operations of the guarulhos, brazil manufacturing site, including approximately 300 employees, were transferred to us from pfizer, which increased our range of planned reduction in certain positions to 2,300 to 2,800. including divestitures, as of december 31, 2017, approximately 2,600 positions have been eliminated and the comprehensive operational efficiency program is substantially complete, however in the fourth quarter of 2017, we expanded the supply network strategy initiative which increases our planned reductions in certain positions by 40. we expect these additional reductions related to our supply network strategy to take place over the next twelve months, and the remainder of the reductions from the initial plan to take place through divestitures over the next several years.
for additional information, see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 4b. acquisitions and divestitures: divestitures and note 5. restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives.
•   continue to provide high-quality products and improve manufacturing production margins-we believe our manufacturing and supply chain provides us with a global platform for continued expansion, including in emerging markets, and that our quality and reliability differentiate us from our competitors; and
components of revenue and costs and expenses our revenue, costs and expenses are reported for the year ended december 31 for each year presented, except for operations outside the united states, for which the financial information is included in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended november 30 for each year presented.
revenue our revenue is primarily derived from our diversified product portfolio of medicines and vaccines used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals. generally, our products are promoted to veterinarians and livestock producers by our sales organization which includes sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists, and then sold directly by us or through distributors. the depth of our product portfolio enables us to address the varying needs of customers in different species and geographies. in 2017, our top two selling products, apoquel and the ceftiofur line, each contributed approximately 7% of our revenue, and combined with our next two top selling products, draxxin and revolution, these four contributed approximately 25% of our revenue. our top ten product lines contributed 39% of our revenue. for additional information regarding our products, including descriptions of our product lines that each represented approximately 1% or more of our revenue in 2017, see item 1. business-products.
costs and expenses costs of sales consist primarily of cost of materials, facilities and other infrastructure used to manufacture our medicine and vaccine products and royalty expenses associated with the intellectual property of our products, when relevant.
selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses consist of, among other things, the internal and external costs of marketing, promotion, advertising and shipping and handling as well as certain costs related to business technology, facilities, legal, finance, human resources, business development, public affairs and procurement.
research and development (r&d) expenses consist primarily of project costs specific to new product r&d and product lifecycle innovation, overhead costs associated with r&d operations and investments that support local market clinical trials for approved indications and expenses related to regulatory approvals for our products. we do not disaggregate r&d expenses by research stage or by therapeutic area for purposes of managing our business.
amortization of intangible assets consists primarily of the amortization expense for identifiable finite-lived intangible assets that have been acquired through business combinations. these assets consist of, but are not limited to, developed technology, brands and trademarks.
restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs consist of all restructuring charges (those associated with acquisition activity and those associated with cost reduction/productivity initiatives), as well as costs associated with acquiring and integrating businesses. restructuring charges are associated with employees, assets and activities that will not continue in the company. acquisition-related costs are associated with acquiring and integrating acquired businesses, such as pharmaq holding as and abbott animal health (aah) both acquired in 2015, and may include transaction costs and expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes.
other (income)/deductions-net consist primarily of various items including net (gains)/losses on asset disposals, royalty-related income, foreign exchange translation (gains)/losses and certain asset impairment charges.
significant accounting policies and application of critical accounting estimates in presenting our financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. for a description of our significant accounting policies, see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 3. significant accounting policies.
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments and, therefore, could have the greatest impact on our financial statements: (i) fair value; (ii) revenue; (iii) asset impairment reviews; and (iv) contingencies.
below are some of our more critical accounting estimates. see also notes to consolidated financial statements- note 3. significant accounting policies- estimates and assumptions for a discussion about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions.
•   for sales returns, we perform calculations in each market that incorporate the following, as appropriate: local returns policies and practices; returns as a percentage of revenue; an understanding of the reasons for past returns; estimated shelf life by product; an estimate of the amount of time between shipment and return or lag time; and any other factors that could impact the estimate of future returns, product recalls, discontinuation of products or a changing competitive environment; and
•   for revenue incentives, we use our historical experience with similar incentives programs to estimate the impact of such programs on revenue.
if any of our ratios, factors, assessments, experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate predictors of our future experience, our results could be materially affected. although the amounts recorded for these revenue deductions are dependent on estimates and assumptions, historically our adjustments to actual results have not been material. the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program, type of customer and geographic location.
amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions. for further information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 3. significant accounting policies: estimates and assumptions.
asset impairment reviews we review all of our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year and we perform detailed testing whenever impairment indicators are present. in addition, we perform impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually. when necessary, we record charges for impairments of long-lived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets.
our impairment review processes are described below and in notes to consolidated financial statements- note 3. significant accounting policies: amortization of intangible assets, depreciation and certain long-lived assets and, for deferred tax assets, in note 3. significant accounting policies: deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax contingencies.
•   a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used. for example, restrictions imposed by the regulatory authorities could affect our ability to manufacture or sell a product, and
•   a projection or forecast that demonstrates losses or reduced profits associated with an asset. this could result, for example, from the introduction of a competitor's product that results in a significant loss of market share or the inability to achieve the previously projected revenue growth, or from the lack of acceptance of a product by customers.
our impairment reviews of most of our long-lived assets depend on the determination of fair value, as defined by u.s. gaap, and these judgments can materially impact our results of operations. a single estimate of fair value can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions. for information about the risks associated with estimates and assumptions, see notes to consolidated financial statements-note 3. significant accounting policies: estimates and assumptions.
intangible assets other than goodwill we test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying value is performed. if the fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized.
as a result of our overall intangible asset impairment reviews, we recorded the following impairments of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill, in restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs and other (income)/deductions-net, as applicable:
•   in 2016, the intangible asset impairment charges reflect approximately $1 million of finite-lived trademarks related to a canine pain management product that is no longer marketed.
•   in 2015, the intangible asset impairment charges reflect (i) approximately $27 million of developed technology rights due to product rationalization decisions associated with our operational efficiency initiative; and (ii) approximately $2 million of acquired in-process research and development (ipr&amp;d) assets related to the termination of a canine oncology project.
when we are required to determine the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill, we use an income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method, also known as the discounted cash flow method. we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset, which includes the application of a terminal value for indefinite-lived assets, and then we apply an asset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the projections, the impact of technological risk associated with ipr&d assets, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the risks inherent in the projected cash flows; foreign currency fluctuations; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.
while all identifiable intangible assets can be impacted by events and thus lead to impairment, in general, identifiable intangible assets that are at the highest risk of impairment include ipr&d assets (approximately $224 million as of december 31, 2017). ipr&d assets are higher-risk assets because r&d is an inherently risky activity.
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses purchased and is assigned to reporting units. we test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, either by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or by performing a quantitative assessment.
factors considered in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, the overall financial performance of the reporting unit and whether there have been sustained declines in our share price. additionally, we evaluate the extent to which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit at the date of the last quantitative assessment performed.
when performing a quantitative assessment to test for goodwill impairment we utilize the income approach, which is forward-looking, and relies primarily on internal forecasts. within the income approach, the method that we use is the discounted cash flow method. we start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit, which includes the application of a terminal value, and then apply a reporting unit-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value. some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the projections, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.
in 2017, we performed both qualitative and select quantitative impairment assessments as of october 1, 2017, which did not result in the impairment of goodwill associated with any of our reporting units.
in 2016, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment as of october 2, 2016, determined that is it not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than the carrying amount, and therefore concluded that a quantitative fair value test was not required.
for all of our reporting units, there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing. for a list of these factors, see forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results.

(a)   amortization expense related to finite-lived acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute products, compounds and intellectual property is included in amortization of intangible assets as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. amortization expense related to finite-lived acquired intangible assets that are associated with a single function is included in cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses or research and development expenses, as appropriate.
total revenue increased by $419 million in 2017, compared with 2016 reflecting operational revenue growth of $406 million, or 8%. operational revenue growth (a non-gaap financial measure) is defined as revenue growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. operational revenue growth was comprised primarily of the following:
•   product rationalizations as part of the operational efficiency initiative, which resulted in a decline of approximately 1%.
total revenue increased by $123 million in 2016, compared with 2015, reflecting operational revenue growth of $250 million, or 5%. operational revenue growth was comprised primarily of the following:
•   recent acquisitions, primarily pharmaq and the acquisition of certain assets of abbott animal health, which contributed approximately 2%, partially offset by:
•   our product and market rationalization as part of the operational efficiency initiative, which resulted in a decline of approximately 5%.
cost of sales increased $109 million, or 7%, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily as a result of:
•   the nonrecurrence of charges reflecting fair value adjustments to inventory related to the acquisition of pharmaq; and
cost of sales decreased $72 million, or 4%, in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily as a result of:
•   the inclusion of the cost of products for pharmaq, as well as charges reflecting fair value adjustments to inventory related to the acquisition of pharmaq;
sg&a expenses decreased $30 million, or 2%, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily as a result of:
•   the nonrecurrence of additional costs related to becoming an independent public company;
•   a reduction in marketing and general and administrative expense driven by our operational efficiency initiative; and
•   a reduction in consulting charges relating to our operational efficiency initiative, partially offset by:
•   higher advertising and promotional spending associated with new products and apoquel®.
sg&a expenses decreased $168 million, or 11%, in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily as a result of:
•   a reduction in marketing and general and administrative expense driven by our operational efficiency initiative;
•   a reduction in the amount of additional costs related to becoming an independent public company;
•   a reduction in consulting charges relating to our operational efficiency initiative, partially offset by:
•   higher advertising and promotional spending associated with new products;
•   an increase in depreciation associated with the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system.
r&d expenses increased $6 million, or 2%, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily as a result of:
•   a reduction in spending driven by our operational efficiency initiative.
r&d expenses increased $12 million, or 3%, in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily as a result of:
•   a reduction in spending driven by our operational efficiency initiative.
amortization of intangible assets increased $6 million, or 7%, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily as a result of certain intangible assets, acquired in november 2015 as part of the pharmaq acquisition, being placed into service during the first quarter of 2017.
amortization of intangible assets increased $24 million, or 39%, in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily as a result of certain intangible assets acquired in the pharmaq acquisition in november 2015.

restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs           $19                  $5                $320        *              (98   )
during 2015, we launched a comprehensive operational efficiency program, which was incremental to the previously announced supply network strategy. these initiatives have focused on reducing complexity in our product portfolios through the elimination of approximately 5,000 product stock keeping units (skus), changing our selling approach in certain markets, reducing our presence in certain countries, and planning to sell or exit 10 manufacturing sites over a long term period. as of december 31, 2017, we divested or exited three u.s. manufacturing sites, four international manufacturing sites, and our 55 percent ownership share of a taiwan joint venture, inclusive of its related manufacturing site. we are also continuing to optimize our resource allocation and efficiency by reducing resources associated with non-customer facing activities and operating more efficiently as a result of less internal complexity and more standardization of processes. as part of these initiatives, we planned to reduce certain positions through divestitures, normal attrition and involuntary terminations by approximately 2,000 to 2,500, subject to consultations with works councils and unions in certain countries. in 2016, the operations of the guarulhos, brazil manufacturing site, including approximately 300 employees, were transferred to us from pfizer, which increased our range of planned reduction in certain positions to 2,300 to 2,800. including divestitures, as of december 31, 2017, approximately 2,600 positions have been eliminated and the comprehensive operational efficiency program is substantially complete, however in the fourth quarter of 2017, we expanded the supply network strategy initiative which increases our planned reductions in certain positions by 40. we expect these additional reductions related to our supply network strategy to take place over the next twelve months, and the remainder of the reductions from the initial plan to take place through divestitures over the next several years.
our acquisition-related costs primarily relate to restructuring charges for employees, assets and activities that will not continue in the future, as well as integration costs. the majority of these net restructuring charges are related to termination costs, but we also exited a number of distributor and other contracts and performed certain facility rationalization efforts. our integration costs are generally comprised of consulting costs related to the integration of systems and processes, as well as product transfer costs.
for additional information regarding restructuring charges and acquisition-related costs, see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 5. restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives.
restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs increased by $14 million in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily as a result of:
•   higher employee termination costs a result of the acquisition of an irish biologic therapeutics company in the third quarter of 2017, initiatives to better align our organizational structure in europe, and our operational efficiency initiative and supply network strategy, and
•   higher integration costs in 2017 as a result of the acquisition of an irish biologic therapeutics company in the third quarter of 2017, and the acquisition of pharmaq in 2015.
restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs decreased by $315 million, or 98%, in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily as a result of:
•   higher employee termination costs and higher asset impairment charges incurred in 2015 as a result of the launch of our operational efficiency initiative and supply network strategy, and

interest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased by $42 million, or 34%, in 2016 compared with 2015, as a result of the issuance of $1.25 billion of our senior notes in november 2015.
the change in other (income)/deductions-net reflects an unfavorable impact of $8 million in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily as a result of:
•   a net loss of $11 million in 2017 related to sales of certain manufacturing sites and products, including the disposal of our manufacturing site in guarulhos, brazil, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with a net gain of $26 million in 2016 related to sales of certain manufacturing sites and products, and

on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act) was enacted which, among other changes, reduces the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code and it will take time to fully analyze the impact of the changes. based on the information available, and the current interpretation of the tax act, the company was able to make a reasonable estimate and recorded a provisional tax expense related to the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax, partially offset by the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities, as of the date of enactment, due to the reduction in the u.s. federal corporate tax rate. pursuant to the staff accounting bulletin published by the securities and exchange commission on december 22, 2017, addressing the challenges in accounting for the effects of the tax act in the period of enactment, companies must report provisional amounts for those specific income tax effects of the tax act for which the accounting is incomplete but a reasonable estimate can be determined. those provisional amounts will be subject to adjustment during a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date. pursuant to this guidance, the estimated impact of the tax act is
on january 11, 2016, the european commission concluded that the belgium "excess profits tax scheme" constitutes illegal state aid and ordered the belgian authorities to recover benefits from taxpayers who are parties to an excess profits ruling. as a result, the 2017 and 2016 effective tax rates do not reflect any benefit of the excess profits ruling and does incorporate the belgium government's recovery of benefits for the periods 2013 through 2015 offset by the remeasurement of the company's deferred tax assets and liabilities using the rates expected to be in place at the time of the reversal and without consideration of implementation of any future operational changes.
the higher effective tax rate in 2017 compared with 2016 is primarily due to the following components:
•   a $212 million net discrete provisional tax expense recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, related to the impact of the tax act enacted on december 22, 2017, including a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax, partially offset by a net tax benefit related to the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities, as of the date of enactment, due to the reduction in the u.s. federal corporate tax rate;
•   changes in valuation allowances and resolution of other tax items;
•   tax expense related to changes in uncertain tax positions, see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 8d. tax matters: tax contingencies, partially offset by:
•   changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, which includes the impact of the location of earnings from operations and repatriation costs. the jurisdictional mix of earnings can vary as a result of repatriation decisions and operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and the impact of non-deductible items;
•   a $15 million discrete tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the effective settlement of certain issues with u.s. and non-u.s. tax authorities;
•   a $9 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2017 related to the excess tax benefits for share-based payments; and
•   a $3 million discrete tax benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2017 related to a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in non-u.s. statutory tax rates.
the lower effective tax rate in 2016 compared with 2015 is primarily due to the following components:
•   the impact of the extent and location of restructuring charges related to the operational efficiency initiative, supply network strategy, asset impairments and gains and losses on asset divestitures;
•   a $15 million discrete tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to prior period tax adjustments;
•   a $10 million discrete tax benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2016 related to a remeasurement of deferred taxes as a result of a change in statutory tax rates;
•   a $7 million discrete tax benefit recorded in 2016 related to the excess tax benefits for share-based payments; and
•   a $2 million discrete tax benefit recorded in the second half of 2016 related to a remeasurement of the company's deferred tax assets and liabilities using the tax rates expected to be in place going forward as a result of the implementation of operational changes, partially offset by:
•   changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, which includes the impact of the location of earnings from operations and repatriation costs. the jurisdictional mix of earnings can vary as a result of repatriation decisions and operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and the impact of non-deductible items;
•   a net tax expense of approximately $35 million mainly recorded in the first half of 2016 related to the impact of the european commission's negative decision on the excess profits rulings in belgium. this net charge represents the recovery of prior tax benefits for the periods 2013 through 2015 offset by the remeasurement of the company's deferred tax assets and liabilities using the rates expected to be in place at the time of the reversal and without consideration of implementation of any future operational changes, and does not include any benefits associated with a successful appeal of the decision;
•   changes in valuation allowances and resolution of other tax items; and
•   tax expense related to changes in uncertain tax positions, see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 8d. tax matters: tax contingencies.

u.s. operating segment u.s. segment revenue increased by $173 million, or 7%, in 2017 compared with 2016, of which approximately $17 million resulted from growth in livestock products and approximately $156 million resulted from growth in companion animal products.
•   livestock revenue increased primarily due to cattle and poultry products, partly offset by swine products. cattle experienced growth across our portfolio, while poultry growth was due to increased sales of medicated feed additives. certain medicated feed additive products for both cattle and swine were negatively impacted by livestock producers' implementation of the veterinary feed directive. in addition, swine declined due to vaccine competition.
•   companion animal revenue growth was driven primarily by our dermatology portfolio, in addition to new products, particularly simparica®. growth was tempered by the prior year's initial sales of certain products into expanded distribution relationships, as well as lower sales due to competition for our pain and anti-infective products.
u.s. segment earnings increased by $129 million, or 9%, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to revenue growth and improved gross margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses related to promotional activity for new products and apoquel®.
international operating segment international segment revenue increased by $253 million, or 11%, in 2017 compared with 2016. operational revenue increased $240 million, or 10%, reflecting growth of approximately $125 million in livestock products and growth of approximately $115 million in companion animal products.
•   companion animal revenue growth resulted primarily from increased sales of our dermatology portfolio, in addition to new products, primarily simparica®. sales also benefited from increased demand in china due to field force expansions and increasing medicalization rates.
international segment earnings increased by $186 million, or 18%, in 2017 compared with 2016. operational earnings growth was $183 million, or 17%, primarily due to higher revenue and improved gross margin.
u.s. operating segment u.s. segment revenue increased by $119 million, or 5%, in 2016 compared with 2015, of which approximately $24 million resulted from declines in livestock products and approximately $143 million resulted from growth in companion animal products.
•   livestock revenue declined primarily due to product rationalizations as part of the company's operational efficiency initiative, which impacted both poultry and swine. additionally, sales of cattle products were impacted by unfavorable market conditions, while swine was impacted by increased competition.
•   companion animal revenue growth was driven by increased sales of apoquel®, new product launches, and initial sales of products into expanded distribution relationships. partially offsetting growth was a decline in the company's surgical fluid products.
u.s. segment earnings increased by $118 million, or 8%, in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to revenue growth and improved gross margin.
international operating segment international segment revenue increased by $4 million, in 2016 compared with 2015. segment revenue was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange, which decreased revenue by approximately 5%, primarily driven by the depreciation of the brazilian real, argentine peso and u.k. pound.
•   livestock revenue growth was driven primarily by the acquisition of pharmaq, with sales primarily in chile and norway. growth also benefited from swine performance in china, as well as cattle performance in certain emerging markets. growth was partially offset by our operational efficiency initiative, which includes product rationalization and the impact of our business decisions in venezuela and india.
•   companion animal revenue growth resulted from increased sales of apoquel®, other new product launches, and demand for our vaccines portfolio in china, due to increased field force expansions and positive medicalization rates.
international segment earnings increased by $113 million, or 12%, in 2016 compared with 2015. operational earnings growth was $159 million, or 17%, primarily due to higher revenue, improved gross margin, and lower operating expenses.
other business activities other business activities includes our css contract manufacturing results, as well as expenses associated with our dedicated veterinary medicine r&d organization, research alliances, u.s. regulatory affairs and other operations focused on the development of our products. other r&d-related costs associated with non-u.s. market and regulatory activities are generally included in the international segment.
other business activities net loss increased by $4 million, or 1%, in 2017 compared with 2016, reflecting the inclusion of the veterinary diagnostics business acquired in 2016 and the irish biologic therapeutics company acquired in 2017.
other business activities net loss increased by $16 million, or 5%, in 2016 compared with 2015, reflecting an increase in r&d spending driven by higher development expenses for late-stage projects and the addition of pharmaq r&d expenses, partially offset by a decrease in r&d spending driven by our operational efficiency initiative
reconciling items reconciling items include certain costs that are not allocated to our operating segments results, such as costs associated with the following:
•   corporate, which includes certain costs associated with information technology, facilities, legal, finance, human resources, business development, and communications, among others. these costs also include certain compensation costs and other miscellaneous operating expenses that are not charged to our operating segments, as well as interest income and expense;
•   certain transactions and events such as (i) purchase accounting adjustments, which includes expenses associated with the amortization of fair value adjustments to inventory, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment; (ii) acquisition-related activities, which includes costs for acquisition and integration; and (iii) certain significant items, which includes non-acquisition-related restructuring charges, certain asset impairment charges, stand-up costs, certain legal and commercial settlements, and costs associated with cost reduction/productivity initiatives; and
•   other unallocated, which includes (i) certain overhead expenses associated with our global manufacturing operations not charged to our operating segments; (ii) certain costs associated with information technology and finance that specifically support our global manufacturing operations; (iii) certain supply chain and global logistics costs; and (iv) procurement costs.
corporate expenses decreased by $59 million, or 9%, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange, a reduction in expenses driven by our operational efficiency initiative and a decrease in certain compensation costs not allocated to our operating segments, partially offset by higher interest expense, net of capitalized interest associated with the additional debt issued in september 2017.
other unallocated expenses increased by $110 million, or 61%, in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to higher global manufacturing and supply costs and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by a decrease in inventory obsolescence, scrap and other charges.
corporate expenses increased by $78 million, or 13%, in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, which includes exposures to certain emerging market currencies and costs related to hedging, and higher interest expense, net of capitalized interest, associated with the additional debt issued in november 2015, partly offset by a decrease in certain compensation costs not charged to our operating segments.
other unallocated expenses decreased by $36 million, or 17%, in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to lower global manufacturing and supply costs and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by an increase in inventory obsolescence, scrap and other charges.
adjusted net income is an alternative view of performance used by management, and we believe that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. we report adjusted net income to portray the results of our major operations, the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of our products, prior to considering certain income statement elements. we have defined adjusted net income as net income attributable to zoetis before the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items described below. the adjusted net income measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for u.s. gaap reported net income attributable to zoetis.
the adjusted net income measure is an important internal measurement for us. we measure our overall performance on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics. the following are examples of how the adjusted net income measure is utilized:
despite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement, adjusted net income is a non-gaap financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by u.s. gaap and, therefore, may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. adjusted net income is presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.
we also recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the adjusted net income measure has limitations, and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to this metric. a limitation of the adjusted net income measure is that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies. we also use other specifically tailored metrics designed to achieve the highest levels of performance.
purchase accounting adjustments adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts that result from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. these impacts, primarily associated with the acquisition of the pharmaq business (acquired in november 2015), certain assets of abbott animal health (acquired in february 2015), kah (acquired in 2011), fdah (acquired in 2009), and pharmacia animal health business (acquired in 2003), include amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets and depreciation related to the increase/decrease to fair value of the acquired fixed assets. therefore, the adjusted net income measure includes the revenue earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the aforementioned significant charges.
while certain purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years, this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance. we believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which r&d costs previously have been expensed.
a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through adjusted net income. these components of adjusted net income are derived solely from the impact of the items listed above. we have not factored in the impact of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances. for example, our r&d costs in total, and in the periods presented, may have been different; our speed to commercialization and resulting revenue, if any, may have been different; or our costs to manufacture may have been different. in addition, our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers. as such, in total, there can be no assurance that our adjusted net income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets.
acquisition-related costs adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering transaction and integration costs associated with significant business combinations or net asset acquisitions because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to acquire and integrate certain businesses as a result of the acquisition decision. we have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies.
we believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees--a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. for this reason, we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the context of a business combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in the ordinary course of business.
the integration costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts generally ending within three years of the transaction. because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy. for example, due to the regulated nature of the animal health medicines and vaccines business, the closure of excess facilities can take several years, as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the fda and/or other regulatory authorities.
certain significant items adjusted net income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items. certain significant items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature. unusual, in this context, may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be nonrecurring; or items that relate to products that we no longer sell. while not all-inclusive, examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be costs related to becoming an independent public company; a major non-acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs for a program that is specific in nature with a defined term, such as those related to our non-acquisition-related cost-reduction and productivity initiatives; amounts related to disposals of products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations as defined by u.s. gaap; certain intangible asset impairments; adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions; significant currency devaluation; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax legislation; or charges related to legal matters. see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 17. commitments and contingencies. our normal, ongoing defense costs or settlements of and accruals on legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items.

analysis of the consolidated statements of comprehensive income substantially all changes in other comprehensive income for the periods presented are related to foreign currency translation adjustments. these changes result from the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar as compared to the currencies in the countries in which we do business. the gains and losses associated with these changes are deferred on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized.
for a discussion about the changes in cash and cash equivalents, short-term borrowings, current portion of long term debt, and long-term debt, net of discount and issuance costs, see "analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources" below.
inventories decreased primarily as a result of our inventory reduction initiative and the sale of our guarulhos, brazil manufacturing site, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 10. inventories.
property, plant and equipment, less accumulated depreciation increased primarily as a result of capital spending, partially offset by depreciation expense and the sale of assets associated with the disposal of our manufacturing site in guarulhos, brazil.
goodwill increased primarily due to the 2017 acquisition of an irish biologic therapeutics company and the consolidation of a european livestock monitoring company, a variable interest entity of which zoetis is the primary beneficiary, in addition to the impact of foreign exchange. see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 4. acquisitions and divestitures and note 12. goodwill and other intangible assets.
identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization increased primarily due to the 2017 acquisitions of an irish biologic therapeutics company and a norwegian fish vaccination company, in addition to the consolidation of a european livestock monitoring company, a variable interest entity of which zoetis is the primary beneficiary. this was partially offset by amortization expense. see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 4. acquisitions and divestitures and note 12. goodwill and other intangible assets.
the net changes in noncurrent deferred tax assets, noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, income taxes payable and other taxes payable primarily reflect adjustments to the accrual for the income tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2017, as well as the impact of the tax act related to the provisional tax liability recorded for the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on the company's undistributed non-u.s. earnings, and the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities, as of the date of enactment, due to the reduction in the u.s. federal corporate tax rate. see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 8. tax matters.
accrued expenses and other current liabilities decreased primarily as a result of payment of employee termination costs associated with operational efficiency initiatives. see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 5. restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives.

operating activities
net cash provided by operating activities was $1,346 million in 2017 compared with $713 million in 2016. the increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to higher income before allocation of noncontrolling interests, lower employee termination payments related to our operational efficiency initiative and supply network strategy, the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business, and lower inventory levels.

investing activities
net cash used in investing activities was $270 million in 2017 compared with $214 million in 2016. the net cash used in investing activities for 2017 was due primarily to capital expenditures and the acquisitions of an irish biologic therapeutics company and a norwegian fish vaccination company, partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of our manufacturing site in guarulhos, brazil. the net cash used in investing activities in 2016 was due primarily to capital expenditures, the acquisition of a veterinary diagnostics business in denmark, partially offset by proceeds from the sales of certain manufacturing sites and products as part of the operational efficiency initiative.

financing activities
net cash used in financing activities was $251 million in 2017 compared with $903 million in 2016. the net cash used in financing activities for 2017 was primarily attributable to the senior note payment in october 2017, the purchase of treasury shares and the payment of dividends, partially offset by the proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes in september 2017. the net cash used in financing activities for 2016 was due primarily to the senior note payment in february 2016, the purchase of treasury shares and the payment of dividends.
net cash used in financing activities was $903 million in 2016 compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $755 million in 2015. the net cash used in financing activities for 2016 was due primarily to the senior note payment in february 2016, the purchase of treasury shares, the acquisition of the remaining noncontrolling interest in a variable interest entity previously consolidated by zoetis as the primary beneficiary, and the payment of dividends. the net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 was primarily attributable to proceeds received from the november 2015 issuance of senior notes, partially offset by the purchase of treasury shares and the payment of dividends.
analysis of financial condition, liquidity and capital resources while we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our operating cash flows and our existing financing arrangements will be sufficient to support our future cash needs, this may be subject to the environment in which we operate. risks to our meeting future funding requirements include global economic conditions described in the following paragraph.
global financial markets may be impacted by macroeconomic, business and financial volatility. as markets change, we will continue to monitor our liquidity position, but there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn will not impact our liquidity or our ability to obtain future financing.
selected measures of liquidity and capital resources certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources follow:
working capital                                            3,123                 2,273
ratio of current assets to current liabilities            3.85:1                3.03:1
(a)   accounts receivable are usually collected over a period of 60 to 90 days. for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the year ended december 31, 2016, the number of days that accounts receivables are outstanding remained approximately the same. we regularly monitor our accounts receivable for collectability, particularly in markets where economic conditions remain uncertain. we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate. our assessment is based on such factors as past due aging, historical and expected collection patterns, the financial condition of our customers, the robust nature of our credit and collection practices and the economic environment.
for additional information about the sources and uses of our funds, see the analysis of the consolidated balance sheets and analysis of the consolidated statements of cash flows sections of this md&a.
credit facility and other lines of credit in december 2016, we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks providing for a five-year $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the credit facility). in december 2017, the maturity for the amended and restated revolving credit agreement was extended through december 2022. subject to certain conditions, we have the right to increase the credit facility to up to $1.5 billion. the credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated net debt as of the end of the period to consolidated earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) for such period) of 3.50:1. upon
entering into a material acquisition, the maximum total leverage ratio increases to 4.00:1, and extends until the fourth full consecutive fiscal quarter ended immediately following the consummation of a material acquisition.
the credit facility also contains a clause which adds back to adjusted consolidated ebitda, any operational efficiency restructuring charge (defined as charges recorded by the company during the period commencing on october 1, 2016 and ending december 31, 2019, related to operational efficiency initiatives), provided that for any twelve month period such charges added back to adjusted consolidated ebitda shall not exceed $100 million in the aggregate.
the credit facility also contains a financial covenant requiring that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (the ratio of ebitda at the end of the period to interest expense for such period) of 3.50:1. in addition, the credit facility contains other customary covenants.
we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016. there were no amounts drawn under the credit facility as of december 31, 2017 or december 31, 2016.
we have additional lines of credit and other credit arrangements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries for general corporate purposes. we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of our outstanding short-term borrowings. as of december 31, 2017, we had access to $75 million of lines of credit which expire at various times throughout 2017 and 2018, and are generally renewed annually. we did not have any borrowings outstanding related to these facilities as of december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016.
domestic and international short-term funds many of our operations are conducted outside the united states. the amount of funds held in the united states will fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons, such as business development activities. as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of u.s. and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional united states, federal, state and local income tax payments. we record u.s. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states, no accrual for u.s. taxes is provided. see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 8. tax matters.
global economic conditions the challenging economic environment has not had, nor do we anticipate that it will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. due to our operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. as markets change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. there can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or a further economic downturn would not impact our ability to obtain financing in the future.

(b)   includes expected employee termination payments that represent contractual obligations, expected payments related to our unfunded u.s. supplemental (non-qualified) savings plans, deferred compensation and expected payments relating to our future benefit payments net of plan assets (included in the determination of the projected benefit obligation) for pension plans that are dedicated to zoetis employees and those transferred to us from pfizer. see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 4. acquisitions and divestitures, note 5. restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives and note 13. benefit plans. excludes approximately $62 million of noncurrent liabilities related to legal and environmental accruals, certain employee termination and exit costs, deferred income and other accruals, most of which do not represent contractual obligations. see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 5. restructuring charges and other costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives and note 17. commitments and contingencies.
(d)   includes the cost of service credit continuation for certain zoetis employees in the pfizer u.s. qualified defined benefit pension and u.s. retiree medical plans, in accordance with the employee matters agreement. see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 13. benefit plans.
(e)   except for amounts reflected in income taxes payable, we are unable to predict the timing of tax settlements, as tax audits can involve complex issues and the resolution of those issues may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation.
debt on september 12, 2017, we issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes (2017 senior notes), with an original issue discount of $7 million. these notes are comprised of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.000% senior notes due 2027 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.950% senior notes due 2047. net proceeds from this offering were partially used in october 2017 to repay, prior to maturity, the aggregate principal amount of $750 million, and a make-whole amount and accrued interest of $4 million, of our 1.875% senior notes due 2018. the remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.
on november 13, 2015, we issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes (2015 senior notes), with an original issue discount of $2 million. on january 28, 2013, we issued $3.65 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes (2013 senior notes) in a private placement, with an original issue discount of $10 million.
the 2013, 2015 and 2017 senior notes are governed by an indenture and supplemental indenture (collectively, the indenture) between us and deutsche bank trust company americas, as trustee. the indenture contains certain covenants, including limitations on our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to incur liens or engage in sale lease-back transactions. the indenture also contains restrictions on our ability to consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of our assets. in addition, the indenture contains other customary terms, including certain events of default, upon the occurrence of which (if not cured or waived), the 2013, 2015 and 2017 senior notes may be declared immediately due and payable.
pursuant to the indenture, we are able to redeem the 2013, 2015 and 2017 senior notes of any series, in whole or in part, at any time by paying a "make whole" premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. pursuant to our tax matters agreement with pfizer, we will not be permitted to redeem the 2013 senior notes due 2023 pursuant to this optional redemption provision, except under limited circumstances. upon the occurrence of a change of control of us and a downgrade of the 2013, 2015 and 2017 senior notes below an investment grade rating by each of moody's investors service, inc. and standard & poor's ratings services, we are, in certain circumstances, required to make an offer to repurchase all of the outstanding 2013, 2015 and 2017 senior notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2013, 2015 and 2017 senior notes together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of repurchase.
credit ratings two major corporate debt-rating organizations, moody's and s&p, assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
the following table provides the current ratings assigned by these rating agencies to our commercial paper and senior unsecured non-credit-enhanced long-term debt:
pension obligations our employees ceased to participate in the pfizer u.s. qualified defined benefit and u.s. retiree medical plans effective december 31, 2012, and liabilities associated with our employees under these plans were retained by pfizer. as part of the separation from pfizer, pfizer is continuing to credit certain employees' service with zoetis generally through december 31, 2017 (or termination of employment from zoetis, if earlier), for certain early retirement benefits with respect to pfizer's u.s. defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans. in connection with the employee matters agreement, zoetis will be responsible for payment of three-fifths of the total cost of the service credit continuation (approximately $38 million) for these plans. the amount of the service cost continuation payment to be paid by zoetis to pfizer was determined and fixed based on an actuarial assessment of the value of the grow-in benefits and will be paid in equal installments over a period of 10 years. as of december 31, 2017, the remaining payments due to pfizer (approximately $19 million in the aggregate) are to be paid over the next five years.
as part of the separation from pfizer, pfizer transferred to us the net pension obligations associated with certain international defined benefit plans. we expect to contribute a total of approximately $6 million to these plans in 2018.
as of december 31, 2017, the supplemental savings plan liability was approximately $31 million.
for additional information, see notes to consolidated financial statements- note 13. benefit plans.
share repurchase program in november 2014, the company's board of directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. this program was substantially completed as of december 31, 2016. in december 2016, the company's board of directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program. purchases of zoetis shares may be made at the discretion of management, depending on market conditions and business needs. share repurchases may be executed through various means, including open market or privately negotiated transactions. during 2017, approximately 8 million shares were repurchased. as of december 31, 2017, there was approximately $1 billion remaining under this authorization.
off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses, we may indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to activities prior to a transaction. these indemnifications typically pertain to environmental, tax, employee and/or product-related matters, and patent-infringement claims. if the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse the loss. these indemnifications are generally subject to threshold amounts, specified claim periods and other restrictions and limitations. historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, recorded amounts for the estimated fair value of these indemnifications are not significant.
in august 2017, the fasb issued an accounting standards update which amends the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements and allows for more hedging strategies to be eligible for hedge accounting. recognition of periodic hedge effectiveness will no longer be required for cash flow and net investment hedges and companies may elect to perform subsequent hedge effectiveness assessments qualitatively. the update also clarifies that the change in fair value of a derivative must be recorded in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item and introduces additional disclosure requirements including cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges and the effect of hedging on individual income statement line items. the provisions of the update are effective beginning january 1, 2019 for interim and annual periods with early adoption permitted for any interim period after issuance of the update. we are currently assessing the timing of our adoption as well as the potential impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
in march 2017, the fasb issued an accounting standards update to simplify and improve the reporting of net periodic pension benefit cost by requiring only present service cost to be presented in the same line item as other current employee compensation costs while remaining components of net periodic benefit cost would be presented within other (income)/deductions-net outside of operations. we will adopt this guidance as of january 1, 2018, the required effective data, and do not expect that the new standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in october 2016, the fasb issued an accounting standards update that will require the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity asset transfer, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs as opposed to when the asset is sold to an outside third party. the provisions of the new standard are effective beginning january 1, 2018, for annual and interim reporting periods. we will adopt this guidance as of january 1, 2018, the required effective date, and do not expect that the new standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in february 2016, the fasb issued an accounting standards update which requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet with a corresponding right of use asset. leases will be classified as financing or operating which will drive the expense recognition pattern. for lessees, the income statement presentation and expense recognition pattern for financing and operating leases is similar to the current model for capital and operating leases, respectively. companies may elect to exclude short-term leases. the update also requires additional disclosures that will better enable users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. we plan to adopt this guidance as of january 1, 2019, the required effective date, for annual and interim reporting periods. the new standard requires a modified retrospective adoption approach, at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. we are currently evaluating the impact that adopting this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.
in may 2014, the fasb issued an accounting standards update that outlines a new, single comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. this update supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance under u.s. gaap. the core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the guidance includes a five-step model for determining how, when and how much revenue should be recognized. this update also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. we will adopt this guidance as of january 1, 2018, the required effective date, using the modified retrospective transition method. under the modified retrospective method, the cumulative effect of applying the new standard will be recognized as of the date of initial application with disclosure of results under both the new and prior standards. the new standard will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption or on an ongoing basis.
forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results this report contains "forward-looking" statements. we generally identify forward-looking statements by using words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "could," "expect," "intend," "project," "plan," "predict," "believe," "seek," "continue," "outlook," "objective," "target," "may," "might," "will," "should," "can have," "likely" or the negative version of these words or comparable words or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of future performance, actions or events.
in particular, forward-looking statements include statements relating to our 2018 financial guidance, future actions, business plans or prospects, prospective products, product approvals or products under development, product supply disruptions, r&d costs, timing and likelihood of success, future operating or financial performance, future results of current and anticipated products and services, strategies, sales efforts, expenses, production efficiencies, production margins, integration of acquired businesses, interest rates, tax rates, changes in tax regimes and laws, foreign exchange rates, growth in emerging markets, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, plans related to share repurchases and dividends, our agreements with pfizer, government regulation and financial results. these statements are not guarantees of future performance, actions or events. forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions. among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from past results and future plans and projected future results are the following:
•   unanticipated safety, quality or efficacy concerns about our products;
•   legal factors, including product liability claims, antitrust litigation and governmental investigations, including tax disputes, environmental concerns, commercial disputes and patent disputes with branded and generic competitors, any of which could preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect the profitability of existing products;
•   failure to protect our intellectual property rights or to operate our business without infringing the intellectual property rights of others;
•   adverse weather conditions and the availability of natural resources;
•   adverse global economic conditions;
•   failure of our r&amp;d, acquisition and licensing efforts to generate new products;
•   the possible impact of competing products, including generic alternatives, on our products and our ability to compete against such products;
•   governmental laws and regulations affecting domestic and foreign operations, including without limitation, tax obligations and changes affecting the tax treatment by the united states of income earned outside the united states that may result from pending and possible future proposals; and
•   governmental laws and regulations affecting our interactions with veterinary healthcare providers.
however, there may also be other risks that we are unable to predict at this time. these risks or uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by a forward-looking statement. you should not put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the sec. you are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our form 10-q and 8-k reports and our other filings with the sec. you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. consequently, you should not consider the above to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.

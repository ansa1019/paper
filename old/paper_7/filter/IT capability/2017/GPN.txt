general we are a leading worldwide provider of payment technology services and software solutions delivering innovative services to our customers globally. our technologies, services and employee expertise enable us to provide a broad range of solutions that allow our customers to accept various payment types and operate their businesses more efficiently. we distribute our services across a variety of channels to customers in 30 countries throughout north america, europe, the asia-pacific region and brazil and operate in three reportable segments: north america, europe and asia-pacific.
we were incorporated in georgia as global payments inc. in 2000 and spun-off from our former parent company in 2001. including our time as part of our former parent company, we have been in the payment technology services business since 1967. since our spin-off, we have grown our annual revenues from $353 million for the year ended may 31, 2001 to $4.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017, through internal expansion of existing operations and through acquisitions.
we provide payment technology and software solutions to customers globally. our payment solutions are similar around the world in that we enable our customers to accept card, electronic, check and digital-based payments. our comprehensive offerings include terminal sales and deployment, authorization processing, settlement and funding processing, customer support and help-desk functions, chargeback resolution, industry compliance, payment security services, consolidated billing and statements and on-line reporting.
in addition, we offer a wide array of enterprise software solutions that streamline business operations to customers in numerous vertical markets. we also provide a variety of value-added services, including analytic and engagement tools, payroll services and reporting that assist our customers with driving demand and operating their businesses more efficiently.
the majority of our revenues is generated by services priced as a percentage of transaction value or a specified fee per transaction, depending on the card type or the vertical. we also earn software licensing and subscription fees and other fees based on specific value-added services that may be unrelated to the number or value of transactions.
our primary business model is to actively market and provide our payment services, enterprise software solutions and other value-added services directly to our customers through a variety of distribution channels. we offer high touch services that provide our customers with reliable and secure solutions coupled with high quality and responsive support services. through our direct sales force worldwide, as well as bank partnerships, we offer our payment technology services, software and other value-added solutions directly to customers in the markets we serve. in addition, we also provide certain of our services through a wholesale distribution channel where we do not maintain the face-to-face relationship with the customer.
we seek to leverage the continued shift to electronic payments by expanding market share in our existing markets through our distribution channels or through acquisitions in north america, europe and the asia-pacific region and investing in and leveraging technology and people, thereby maximizing shareholder value. we also seek to enter new markets through acquisitions in europe, the asia-pacific region and the latin america region.
our business has not had pronounced seasonality in which more than 30% of our revenues occurred in one fiscal quarter. however, each geographic channel has somewhat higher and lower quarters given the nature of the merchant portfolio.
in 2016, we changed our fiscal year end from may 31 to december 31. as a result, the period consisting of the seven months ended december 31, 2016 is considered the "2016 fiscal transition period." when our financial results for the year ended december 31, 2017 and the 2016 fiscal transition period are compared to our financial results for the prior-year periods, the results compare the twelve-month period from january 1, 2017 through december 31, 2017 to the twelve-month period from january 1, 2016 through december 31, 2016 and compare the seven-month period from june 1, 2016 through december 31, 2016 to the seven-month period from june 1, 2015 through december 31, 2015. the results for the twelve months ended december 31, 2016 and the seven months ended december 31, 2015 are unaudited.
executive overview we experienced strong business and financial performance around the world during the year ended december 31, 2017. highlights related to our financial condition and results of operations as of december 31, 2017 and for the year then ended include the following:
•   consolidated revenues increased by 17.9% to $3,975.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 from $3,371.0 million for 2016, reflecting growth in each of our operating segments and additional revenues from acquired businesses.
•   consolidated operating income was $558.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $356.3 million for 2016. our operating margin for the year ended december 31, 2017 was 14.1% compared to 10.6% for 2016. the increase in operating income and operating margin was primarily due to the contribution of revenue growth and a decrease in costs associated with acquisition and integration expenses of $47.5 million.
•   net income attributable to global payments was $468.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $201.8 million for 2016, and diluted earnings per share was $3.01 for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $1.37 for 2016.
•   on december 22, 2017, the united states enacted the 2017 u.s. tax act. as a result, we recorded a provisional net income tax benefit of $158.7 million, which increased diluted earnings per share by $1.02 for the year ended december 31, 2017. the 2017 u.s. tax act resulted in numerous changes, including a reduction in the u.s. federal tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018 and the transition of the u.s. federal tax system to a territorial regime. as part of this transition, the 2017 u.s. tax act imposed a one-time mandatory "transition" tax on foreign earnings not previously subjected to u.s. income tax, payable over eight years. we expect that the reduction in the u.s. federal income tax rate and the new territorial tax regime will have a favorable effect on our earnings and cash flows in future periods. a territorial tax regime rather than a worldwide system will generally allow companies to repatriate future foreign source earnings without incurring additional u.s. income taxes by providing a 100% exemption for the foreign source portion of dividends from certain foreign subsidiaries.
emerging trends the payments industry continues to grow worldwide and as a result, certain large payment technology companies, including us, have expanded operations globally by pursuing acquisitions and creating alliances and joint ventures. we expect to continue to expand into new markets internationally or increase our scale and improve our competitiveness in existing markets by pursuing further acquisitions and joint ventures.
we believe that the number of electronic payment transactions will continue to grow and that an increasing percentage of these will be facilitated through emerging technologies.  as a result, we expect an increasing portion of our future capital investment will be allocated to support the development of new and emerging technologies; however, we do not expect our aggregate capital spending to increase materially from our current level of spending as a result of this.
we also believe new markets will continue to develop in areas that have been previously dominated by paper-based transactions. we expect industries such as education, government and healthcare, as well as payment types such as recurring payments and business-to-business payments, to continue to see transactions migrate to electronic-based solutions.  we anticipate that the continued development of new services and the emergence of new vertical markets will be a factor in the growth of our business and our revenue in the future.
acquisitions on september 1, 2017, we acquired active network for total purchase consideration of $1.2 billion, consisting of approximately $600 million in cash and 6.4 million shares of our common stock. active network delivers cloud-based enterprise software, including payment technology solutions, to event organizers in the communities and health and fitness vertical markets. this acquisition aligns with our technology-enabled, software driven strategy and adds an enterprise software business operating in two additional vertical markets that we believe offer attractive growth fundamentals.
on april 22, 2016, we merged with heartland in a cash-and-stock transaction for total purchase consideration of $3.9 billion. the merger significantly expanded our small and medium-sized enterprise distribution, merchant base and vertical reach in the united states.
on june 1, 2015, we acquired certain assets of certegy check services, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of fidelity national information services, inc. ("fis"). under the purchase arrangement, we acquired substantially all of the assets of its gaming business related to licensed gaming operators (the "fis gaming business"), including relationships with gaming clients in approximately 260 locations as of the acquisition date, for $237.5 million.
on march 25, 2015, we acquired pay and shop limited, which does business as realex payments ("realex"), for €110.2 million ($118.9 million equivalent as of the acquisition date). realex is a leading european online payment gateway technology provider based in dublin, ireland. this transaction furthered our strategy to provide omnichannel solutions that combine gateway services, payment service provisioning and payment technology services across europe.
on october 10, 2014, we completed the acquisition of ezidebit for aud302.6 million ($266.0 million equivalent as of the acquisition date). ezidebit is a leading integrated payments company focused on recurring payments verticals in australia and new zealand. ezidebit markets its services through a network of integrated software vendors and direct channels to numerous vertical markets. we acquired ezidebit to establish a direct distribution channel in australia and new zealand and to further enhance our existing integrated solutions offerings.
see "note 2-acquisitions" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these and other acquisitions.
visa europe through certain of our subsidiaries in europe, we were a member and shareholder of visa europe. on june 21, 2016, visa acquired all of the membership interests in visa europe, including ours, upon which we recorded a gain of $41.2 million included in interest and other income in our consolidated statement of income for the seven months ended december 31, 2016. we received up-front consideration comprised of €33.5 million ($37.7 million equivalent at june 21, 2016) in cash and series b and c convertible preferred shares whose initial conversion rate equates to visa common shares valued at $22.9 million as of june 21, 2016. however, the preferred shares were assigned a value of zero based on transfer restrictions, visa's ability to adjust the conversion rate, and the estimation uncertainty associated with those factors. the fair value of the preferred shares was determined using inputs classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy due to the absence of quoted market prices, lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management's judgment. the preferred shares will convert into visa common shares at periodic intervals over a 12-year period. based on the outcome of potential litigation involving visa europe in the united kingdom and elsewhere in europe, the conversion rate of the preferred shares could be adjusted down such that the number of visa common shares we ultimately receive could be as low as zero, and approximately €25.6 million ($28.8 million equivalent at june 21, 2016) of the up-front cash consideration could be refundable. on the third anniversary of the closing of the acquisition by visa, we are contractually entitled to receive €3.1 million ($3.5 million at june 21, 2016) of deferred consideration (plus compounded interest at a rate of 4.0% per annum).
results of operations revenues the majority of our revenues is generated by services priced as a percentage of transaction value or a specified fee per transaction, depending on card type or the vertical. we also earn software licensing and subscription fees and other fees based on specific value-added services that may be unrelated to the number or value of transactions. these revenues depend upon a number of factors, such as demand for and price of our services, the technological competitiveness of our offerings, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry and general economic conditions.
we provide payment technology services and software solutions to customers and fund settlement either directly, in markets where we have direct membership with the payment networks, or through our relationship with a member financial institution in markets where we are sponsored. revenues are recognized in the amount of customer billing net of interchange fees. we market our services through a variety of sales channels, including a direct sales force, trade associations, agent and enterprise software providers and referral arrangements with value-added resellers, which we generally refer to as "direct distribution." we also sell services through our iso channel, where the iso receives a share of the customer profitability in the form of a monthly residual payment, which is reflected as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income.
operating expenses cost of service cost of service consists primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to operations and technology-related personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement functions; payment network fees; the cost of transaction processing systems, including third-party services; the cost of network telecommunications capability; depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities performing these functions; amortization of intangible assets and provisions for operating losses.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, wages, commissions and related expenses paid to sales personnel, customer support functions other than those supporting revenue, administrative employees and management; commissions paid to isos, independent contractors and other third parties; other selling expenses; occupancy costs of leased space directly related to these functions; share-based compensation expense and advertising costs.
operating income and operating margin for the purpose of discussing segment operations, we refer to "operating income," which is calculated by subtracting segment direct expenses from segment revenues. overhead and shared expenses, including share-based compensation, are not allocated to segment operations; they are reported in the caption "corporate." similarly, we refer to "operating margin" regarding segment operations, which is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenues.

interest and other expense increased by $28.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. the outstanding borrowings on our long-term debt facilities increased significantly in april 2016 as a result of incremental borrowings we made to fund a portion of the total consideration for our merger with heartland. since then, we have made principal repayments
that have lowered our average outstanding borrowings, and we have lowered the leverage-based margins we pay on interest rates through refinancing activities that we completed in october 2016 and may 2017. the savings in interest expense that we realized during the second half of 2017 due to these refinancing activities were partially offset by increases in london interbank offered rate ("libor") during the intervening time frame and additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility to complete the acquisition of active network.
income tax benefit (provision)
we reported an income tax benefit of $101.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, reflecting the effect of a provisional net income tax benefit of $158.7 million recorded in connection with the 2017 u.s. tax act. our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2017 was a benefit of 25.8%, which differs from the federal u.s. statutory rate and the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to the net tax benefit we recorded in connection with the 2017 u.s. tax act. see "note 9-income tax" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more discussion about the effects of the 2017 u.s. tax act on our accounting for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2017.

interest and other expense increased by $76.8 million for the seven months ended december 31, 2016 compared to the prior-
year period primarily due to an increase in interest expense incurred resulting from an increase in the outstanding borrowings to fund the merger with heartland.
income tax provision our effective income tax rates were 20.6% and 25.3%, respectively, for the seven months ended december 31, 2016 and 2015. the decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily due to a higher percentage of income generated in international jurisdictions with lower tax rates (primarily as a result of the merger-related expenses incurred in the united states).

selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 2.4% to $1,325.6 million during the year ended may 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. as a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 45.7% for the year ended may 31, 2016 from 46.7% in the prior year. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due to additional costs to support the growth of our business, including expenses of $51.3 million associated with our merger with heartland.
operating income and operating margin north america segment. operating income in our north america segment increased by 4.9% to $307.6 million for the year ended may 31, 2016 compared to the prior year despite the effect of unfavorable currency fluctuations of $20.5 million. the operating margin was 15.0% and 14.9% for the years ended may 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the increase in operating income was primarily due to revenue growth in our u.s. business, partially offset by additional intangible asset amortization related to our acquisitions and the effect of unfavorable currency fluctuations.
europe segment. operating income in our europe segment increased by 2.0% to $244.8 million for the year ended may 31, 2016 compared to the prior year despite the effect of unfavorable currency fluctuations of $19.7 million. the operating margin was 38.7% and 39.0% for the years ended may 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the increase in operating income was primarily driven by revenue growth, partially offset by the effect of unfavorable currency fluctuations.
asia-pacific segment. operating income in our asia segment increased by 27.8% to $50.7 million for the year ended may 31, 2016 compared to the prior year despite the effect of unfavorable currency fluctuations in the asia-pacific region of $3.4 million. the operating margin was 23.8% and 21.0% for the years ended may 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the increases in operating income and operating margin were due to incremental revenues from the acquisition and subsequent organic growth of ezidebit, which generates a higher operating margin than our legacy business in the region.
corporate. corporate expenses increased to $178.3 million for the year ended may 31, 2016 compared to the prior year due primarily to expenses of $51.3 million associated with our merger with heartland.
other income/expense, net interest and other expense increased by $24.9 million for the year ended may 31, 2016 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in borrowings to fund our merger with heartland.
income taxes provision the provision for income taxes decreased by $37.3 million for the year ended may 31, 2016 compared to the prior year due to a decrease in income before income taxes, largely due to expenses of $51.3 million in the u.s. associated with our merger with heartland, and a lower effective income tax rate. the decrease in our effective income tax rate from 25.9% to 19.6% during the year ended may 31, 2016 was primarily due to a higher percentage of the earnings before income taxes derived from foreign operations with lower income tax rates (primarily as a result of the merger-related expenses incurred in the united states) as well as the elimination of certain net deferred tax liabilities associated with undistributed earnings from canada as a result of management's plans to reinvest these earnings outside of the united states indefinitely.
liquidity and capital resources in the ordinary course of our business, a significant portion of our liquidity comes from operating cash flows. cash flow from operations is used to make planned capital investments in our business, to pursue acquisitions that meet our corporate objectives, to pay dividends, to pay down debt and to repurchase shares of our common stock. accumulated cash balances are invested in high-quality, marketable short-term instruments.
our capital plan objectives are to support our operational needs and strategic plan for long-term growth while maintaining a low cost of capital. we use our credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund acquisitions. in addition, specialized lines of credit are also used in certain of our markets to fund merchant settlement prior to receipt of funds from the card network. we regularly evaluate our liquidity and capital position relative to cash requirements, and we may elect to raise additional funds in the future, either through the issuance of debt, equity or otherwise.
at december 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $1,335.9 million. of this amount, we consider $658.4 million to be available for general purposes, which does not include the following: (i) settlement-related cash balances, (ii) funds held as collateral for merchant losses ("merchant reserves") and (iii) funds held for customers. settlement-related cash balances represent funds that we hold when the incoming amount from the card networks precedes the funding obligation to the merchant. settlement-related cash balances are not restricted; however, these funds are generally paid out in satisfaction of settlement processing obligations the following day. merchant reserves serve as collateral to minimize contingent liabilities associated with any losses that may occur under the merchant agreement. while this cash is not restricted in its use, we believe that designating this cash to collateralize merchant reserves strengthens our fiduciary standing with our member sponsors and is in accordance with the guidelines set by the card networks. funds held for customers and the corresponding liability that we record in "customer deposits" include amounts collected prior to remittance on our customers' behalf.
our available cash balance at december 31, 2017 included $595.1 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings were considered indefinitely reinvested outside the united states prior to the enactment of the 2017 u.s. tax act. these cash balances reflected our capital investments in these subsidiaries and the accumulation of cash flows generated by their operations, net of cash flows used to service debt locally and fund acquisitions outside of the united states. under the 2017 u.s. tax act, a company's foreign earnings accumulated under legacy tax laws are deemed repatriated, and the 2017 u.s. tax act generally eliminates u.s. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries. as a result, our provisional position is that we now only consider approximately $60 million of our undistributed foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states as of december 31, 2017. in february 2018, we repatriated approximately $300 million from certain of our foreign subsidiaries and used the cash to reduce outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
operating activities provided net cash of $512.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2017, which was primarily attributable to net income of $494.1 million adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization expense of $451.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in working capital of $358.9 million.
fluctuations in working capital are affected primarily by timing of month-end and transaction volume, especially changes in settlement processing assets and liabilities. changes in settlement processing assets and liabilities decreased operating cash flows by $361.7 million and $78.8 million during the years ended december 31, 2017 and may 31, 2015, respectively. changes in settlement processing assets and liabilities increased operating cash flows by $35.6 million during the 2016 fiscal transition period and $218.1 million during the year ended may 31, 2016.
operating activities provided net cash of $515.8 million during the 2016 fiscal transition period and $592.9 million and $429.9 million, respectively, during the years ended may 31, 2016 and 2015. the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities since 2015, during which time we completed the acquisitions of heartland and active network, among others, was primarily due to our revenue growth and corresponding increase in operating income. the increase in operating cash flows from our growing business during this period was partially offset by investments made to integrate the acquired businesses. during the year ended december 31, 2017, the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31, 2016, we incurred $94.6 million, $91.6 million and $51.3 million, respectively, of acquisition and integration expenses primarily related to heartland. in addition, during that same period of time, our interest expense increased substantially as a result of long-term debt we have issued, primarily to help fund these acquisitions. during the year ended december 31, 2017, the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31, 2016, cash paid for interest expense was $154.2 million, $93.6 million and $58.7 million, respectively.
we used net cash in investing activities of $736.0 million, $86.7 million and $2,127.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2017, the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31, 2016, respectively. cash used for investing activities represents primarily cash used to fund business acquisitions and capital expenditures. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we used cash of $599.5 million to acquire active network, and during the year ended may 31, 2016, we used cash of $2.0 billion to acquire heartland. in addition to cash, we have used our common stock to fund a portion of the consideration for both the heartland and active network acquisitions. see "note 2-acquisitions" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our business acquisitions and how we funded those acquired businesses.
we made capital expenditures of $181.9 million, $88.9 million and $91.6 million to purchase property and equipment (including internal-use capitalized software development projects) during the year ended december 31, 2017, the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31, 2016, respectively. these investments include software and hardware to support the development of new technologies, continued consolidation and enhancement of our operating platforms and infrastructure to support our growing business.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we sold our operating facility in jeffersonville, indiana for $37.5 million. in addition, during the 2016 fiscal transition period we exchanged all of our membership interest in visa europe to visa for up-front consideration, including cash of approximately $37.7 million.
financing activities include borrowings and repayments made under our credit facility as well as borrowings and repayments made under specialized lines of credit to fund daily settlement activities. financing activities also include cash flows associated with common stock repurchase programs and share-based compensation programs as well as cash distributions made to noncontrolling interests and our shareholders. cash flows from financing activities provided net cash of $352.3 million and $2.0 billion during the years ended december 31, 2017 and may 31, 2016, respectively. during the 2016 fiscal transition period, we used net cash in financing activities of $278.8 million.
proceeds from long-term debt were $2.0 billion, $1.3 billion and $6.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017, the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31, 2016, respectively. repayments of long-term debt were $1.8 billion, $1.4 billion and $3.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017, the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31, 2016, respectively. proceeds from long-term debt include borrowings that we make from time-to-time under our revolving credit facility. proceeds from long-term debt also include incremental borrowings we have made to fund a portion of the consideration paid for acquired businesses and the effect of various refinancing activities to optimize our borrowing programs. repayments of long-term debt include repayments that we make from time-to-time under our revolving credit facility as well as scheduled principal repayments made under our term loans. debt issuance costs reflect the amount we paid to complete these financing activities. during the year ended
may 31, 2016, we added incremental borrowings to the credit facility then in place of $1.8 billion to fund, in part, the cash consideration and merger-related costs associated with heartland and to repay certain portions of heartland's indebtedness.
because we often receive funding from the payment networks after we fund our merchants, we have specialized lines of credit in various markets where we do business to fund settlement. activity under our settlement lines of credit is affected primarily by timing of month-end and transaction volume. during the year ended december 31, 2017 and the 2016 fiscal transition period, we had net proceeds from settlement lines of credit of $221.5 million and $20.6 million. during the year ended may 31, 2016, we had net repayments of settlement lines of credit of $206.0 million.
we make repurchases of our common stock mainly through the use of open market purchases and, at times, through accelerated share repurchase programs. during the year ended december 31, 2017, the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31, 2016, we invested $34.8 million, $178.2 million and $136.0 million, respectively, to repurchase shares of our common stock. on february 6, 2018, the board increased its authorization to repurchase shares of our common stock to $600 million.
we believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our long-term debt and lines of credit described below, together with future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future.
long-term debt and lines of credit we are party to a credit facility agreement with bank of america, n.a., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of financial institutions, as lenders and other agents (as amended from time to time). this credit facility was most recently amended on may 2, 2017 (the "fourth amendment") and, as amended, provides for (i) a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility; (ii) a $1.5 billion term loan; (iii) a $1.3 billion term loan; and (iv) a $1.2 billion term loan facility. the fourth amendment increased the total financing capacity under the credit facility on may 2, 2017 from $4.9 billion to $5.2 billion, although the outstanding debt under the credit facility did not change as we repaid certain outstanding amounts under the term a loan, the term a-2 loan and the revolving credit facility in connection with the fourth amendment. substantially all of the assets of our domestic subsidiaries are pledged as collateral under the credit facility.
the credit facility provides for an interest rate, at our election, of either libor or a base rate, in each case plus a leverage-based margin. as of december 31, 2017, the interest rates on the term a loan, the term a-2 loan and the term b-2 loan were 3.32%, 3.24% and 3.57%, respectively, and the interest rate on the revolving credit facility was 3.24%. the credit facility also provides for a commitment fee with respect to borrowings under the revolving credit facility at an applicable rate per annum ranging from 0.20% to 0.30% depending on our leverage ratio. as of december 31, 2017, the aggregate outstanding balance on the term loans was $3.9 billion, and the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility was $765.0 million.
the term a loan and the term a-2 loan mature, and the revolving credit facility expires, on may 2, 2022. the term b-2 loan matures on april 22, 2023. the term a loan principal must be repaid in quarterly installments in the amount of 1.25% of principal through june 2019, increasing to 1.875% of principal through june 2021, and increasing to 2.50% of principal through march 2022, with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity in may 2022. the term a-2 loan principal must be repaid in quarterly installments of $1.7 million through june 2018, increasing to quarterly installments of $8.6 million through march 2022, with the remaining balance due upon maturity in may 2022. the term b-2 loan principal must be repaid in quarterly installments in the amount of 0.25% of principal through march 2023, with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity in april 2023.
the credit facility allows us to issue standby letters of credit of up to $100 million in the aggregate under the revolving credit facility. outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility reduce the amount of borrowings available to us. borrowings available to us under the revolving credit facility are further limited by the covenants described below under "compliance with covenants." the total available commitments under the revolving credit facility at december 31, 2017 were $473.3 million.
settlement lines of credit in various markets where we do business, we have lines of credit, which are restricted for use in funding settlement. the settlement lines of credit generally have variable interest rates, are subject to annual review and are denominated in local currency but may, in some cases, facilitate borrowings in multiple currencies. for certain of our lines of credit, the available credit is increased
by the amount of cash we have on deposit in specific accounts with the lender. accordingly, the amount of the outstanding line of credit may exceed the stated credit limit. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, a total of $59.3 million and $51.0 million, respectively, of cash on deposit was used to determine the available credit.
as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $635.2 million and $392.1 million, respectively, outstanding under these lines of credit with additional capacity of $689.4 million as of december 31, 2017 to fund settlement. the weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings was 2.0% and 1.90% at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
compliance with covenants the credit facility contains customary affirmative and restrictive covenants, including, among others, financial covenants based on our leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios, as defined in the agreement. as of december 31, 2017, financial covenants under the credit facility required a leverage ratio no greater than: (i) 4.50 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter ending during the period from july 1, 2017 through june 30, 2018; (ii) 4.25 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter ending during the period from july 1, 2018 through june 30, 2019; and (iii) 4.00 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter ending thereafter. the fixed charge coverage ratio is required to be no less than 2.25 to 1.00.
the credit facility and settlement lines of credit also include various other covenants that are customary in such borrowings. the credit facility includes covenants, subject in each case to exceptions and qualifications that may restrict certain payments, including, in certain circumstances, the payment of cash dividends in excess of our current rate of $0.01 per share per quarter.
the credit facility also includes customary events of default, the occurrence of which, following any applicable cure period, would permit the lenders to, among other things, declare the principal, accrued interest and other obligations to be immediately due and payable. we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of and for the year ended december 31, 2017.
see "note 7-long-term debt and lines of credit" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our borrowing arrangements.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interest, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or other obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk support other than the guarantee services described under "critical accounting policies" below.
bin/ica agreements we have entered into sponsorship or depository and processing agreements with certain banks. these agreements allow us to use the banks' identification numbers, referred to as bank identification number ("bin") for visa transactions and interbank card association ("ica") number for mastercard transactions, to clear credit card transactions through visa and mastercard. certain of such agreements contain financial covenants, and we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december 31, 2017.
commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2017:
settlement lines of credit                                635,166                 635,166                         -                         -                         -
transition tax payable under 2017 u.s. tax act(3)          63,744                   8,022                     9,691                     9,691                    36,340
(1) interest on long-term debt is based on rates effective and amounts borrowed as of december 31, 2017. the estimated effect of interest rate swaps is included in interest on long-term debt. since the contractual rates for our long-term debt and settlements on our interest rate swaps are variable, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided.
(2) includes estimate of future payments for noncancelable contractual obligations related to service arrangements with suppliers for fixed or minimum amounts.
(3) under the 2017 u.s. tax act, a company's foreign earnings accumulated under legacy tax laws are deemed repatriated with a one-time mandatory "transition" tax on foreign earnings not previously subjected to u.s. income tax. the transition tax on those deemed repatriated earnings may be paid over eight years. the total amount of the transition tax payable and the payments due by future period are estimates as of december 31, 2017 and subject to change. see "note 9-income tax" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more discussion about the effects of the 2017 u.s. tax act on our accounting for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2017.
the table above excludes other obligations that we may have, such as employee benefit obligations and other noncurrent liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, because the timing of the related payments is not determinable or because there is no contractual obligation associated with the underlying obligations.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap, which often require the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods. we consider the following accounting policies to be critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements because the application of these policies requires significant judgment on the part of management, and as a result, actual future developments may be different from those expected at the time that we make these critical judgments. we have discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors.
accounting estimates necessarily require subjective determinations about future events and conditions. therefore, the following descriptions of our critical accounting policies are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward-looking statements. you should read the following in conjunction with "note 1-basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies" of the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the risk factors contained in "item 1a - risk factors" of this annual report on form 10-k.
goodwill we have historically performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of january 1. as a result of the change in our fiscal year end from may 31 to december 31, we elected to change our annual goodwill impairment test date from january 1 to october 1 to give us sufficient time to complete our assessment in conjunction with our year-end reporting. we performed an annual goodwill impairment test on january 1, 2017 and on october 1, 2017.
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative testing for impairment is necessary. the option of whether or not to perform a qualitative assessment is made annually and may vary by reporting unit.
factors we consider in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance of our reporting units, events or changes affecting the composition or carrying amount of the net assets of our reporting units, sustained decrease in our share price, and other relevant entity-specific events. if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test would be required.
during the first quarter of 2017, we revised our reporting unit structure within our north america segment to reflect changes made in connection with the integration of heartland. under the revised reporting unit structure, we operate two reporting units in our north america segment: (i) payments and (ii) integrated solutions and vertical markets. we reassigned the goodwill previously allocated to north america merchant services and heartland to the two new reporting units using a relative fair value approach. as a result of the change in reporting units, we performed goodwill impairment tests immediately before and after this change in reporting units and determined that there was no impairment.
following the revision described above, we now have seven reporting units: north america payments, north america integrated solutions and vertical markets, u.k. merchant services, asia-pacific merchant services, central and eastern europe merchant services, russia merchant services and spain merchant services. as of october 1, 2017, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment of impairment for each of our reporting units. we determined on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of each reporting unit was not more likely than not less than the respective carrying amounts. we believe that the fair value of each of our reporting units is substantially in excess of its carrying amount.
intangible and long-lived assets other intangible assets include customer-related intangible assets (such as customer lists and merchant contracts), contract-based intangible assets (such as non-compete agreements, referral agreements and processing rights), acquired technology and trademarks associated with acquisitions. these assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. the useful lives for customer-related intangible assets are determined based primarily on forecasted cash flows, which include estimates for the revenues, expenses, and customer attrition associated with the assets. the useful lives of contract-based intangible assets are equal to the terms of the agreements. the useful lives of amortizable trademarks and trade names are based on our plans to phase out the trademarks and trade names in the applicable markets. acquired technology is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life.
amortization for most of our customer-related intangible assets is calculated using an accelerated method. in determining amortization expense under our accelerated method for any given period, we calculate the expected cash flows for that period that were used in determining the acquired value of the asset and divide that amount by the expected total cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. we multiply that percentage by the initial carrying amount of the asset to arrive at the amortization expense for that period. if the cash flow patterns that we experience differ significantly from our initial estimates, we adjust the amortization schedule prospectively. these cash flow patterns are derived using certain assumptions and cost allocations due to a significant amount of asset interdependencies that exist in our business. we did not make any significant adjustments to the amortization schedules of our intangible assets during the year ended december 31, 2017.
we believe that our accelerated method better approximates the expected distribution of cash flows generated by our acquired customer relationships. we use the straight-line method of amortization for our contract-based intangibles and amortizable trademarks.
we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of property and equipment and finite-life intangible assets may not be recoverable. when factors indicate that these long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we assess the potential impairment by determining whether the carrying amount of such long-lived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded, measured as the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount. fair values are determined based on quoted market prices
or discounted cash flow analysis as applicable. we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the useful lives of property and equipment and finite-life intangible assets may warrant revision.
capitalization of internal-use software we develop software that is used in providing services to customers. capitalization of internal-use software, primarily associated with operating platforms, occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage, management authorizes the project, management commits to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended. the preliminary project stage consists of the conceptual formulation of alternatives, the evaluation of alternatives, the determination of existence of needed technology and the final selection of alternatives. costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. currently unforeseen circumstances in software development, such as a significant change in the manner in which the software is intended to be used, obsolescence or a significant reduction in revenues due to merchant attrition, could require us to implement alternative plans with respect to a particular effort, which could result in the impairment of previously capitalized software development costs. the carrying amount of internal-use software, including work in progress, at december 31, 2017 was $327.2 million. costs capitalized during the year ended december 31, 2017, the 2016 fiscal transition period and the years ended may 31, 2016 and 2015 totaled $79.3 million, $37.7 million, $36.5 million and $35.1 million, respectively. internal-use software is amortized over its estimated useful life, which is typically 2 to 10 years, in a manner that best reflects the pattern of economic use of the assets.
income taxes we determine our provision for income taxes using management's judgments, estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.
accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 740, "income taxes" ("asc 740") requires companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment. to address the application of gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 u.s. tax act, which was enacted on december 22, 2017, the sec staff issued sab 118. sab 118 provides guidance for registrants regarding the application of asc topic 740 in the reporting period that includes december 22, 2017, including reporting provisional amounts for those specific income tax effects of the 2017 u.s. tax act for which the accounting is incomplete but a reasonable estimate can be determined. in addition, sab 118 requires provisional amounts or adjustments to provisional amounts identified in the measurement period, as defined, to be included as an adjustment to tax expense or benefit from continuing operations in the period the amounts are determined.
as a result of the enactment of the 2017 u.s. tax act, our income tax benefit for the year ended december 31, 2017 included a net benefit of $158.7 million, reflecting provisional amounts for specific income tax effects as a result of the enactment of the 2017 u.s. tax act for which our accounting is incomplete but could be reasonably estimated as of december 31, 2017. we are in the process of determining the actual effect of the 2017 u.s. tax act. our reasonable estimates are based on provisional amounts that may be adjusted upon obtaining, preparing or analyzing additional information. we could make adjustments to the provisional amounts of the tax effects during subsequent periods in 2018.
sab 118 provides that the measurement period is complete when a company's accounting is complete and in no circumstances should the measurement period extend beyond one year from the enactment date. due to the timing of enactment of this new tax legislation, certain details of the 2017 u.s. tax act may not be fully understood or operationalized by the time we issue this annual report on form 10-k. further guidance could be forthcoming from the u.s. treasury, the sec or the accounting profession that could give rise to further effects of the 2017 u.s. tax act on our consolidated financial statements in future periods. the effect of the 2017 u.s. tax act on our consolidated financial statements and the status of our accounting for its effects is further described along with other disclosures required by sab 118 in "note 9-income taxes" of the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
we believe our tax return positions are fully supportable; however, we recognize the benefit for tax positions only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits. issues raised by a tax authority may be resolved at an amount different than the related benefit recognized. when facts and circumstances change (including an effective settlement
of an issue or statute of limitations expiration), the effect is recognized in the period of change. a portion of the unrecognized tax benefits that exist at december 31, 2017 would affect our provision for income taxes in the future if recognized. judgment is required to determine whether or not some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. to the extent we determine that we will not realize the benefit of some or all of our deferred tax assets, then these deferred tax assets are adjusted through our provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made.
effect of new accounting pronouncements - recently issued pronouncements not yet adopted as more fully described in "note 1-basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies" in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, effective january 1, 2018, we will adopt a new revenue accounting standard that will change the presentation of certain fees that we pay to third parties and currently present as an operating expense. effective january 1, 2018, our revenues will be presented net of such payments, including payment network fees, which represented approximately 23% of our total consolidated revenues in 2017. we expect a similar amount of payment network fees in 2018. this change in presentation of fees paid to third parties will reduce our reported revenues and operating expenses by the same amount and will have no effect on operating income.
the application of the new standard will also change the amount and timing of revenue and expenses to be recognized under certain of our customer arrangements for periods after december 31, 2017. further, we will also be required to capitalize additional costs to obtain contracts with customers, as well as certain implementation and set-up costs, and in some cases, will be required to amortize these costs and costs that we currently capitalize (such as capitalized customer acquisition costs) over a longer time period. we currently estimate that the net effect of applying the provision of the new accounting standard will be an increase of less than 1% of our operating income in 2018.

table of contents organization of information management's discussion and analysis provides a narrative on the company's financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements. it includes the following sections:
•   consolidated results and non-segment items
•   business segment results - 2017 vs. 2016
•   business segment results - 2016 vs. 2015
•   liquidity and capital resources

revenues for fiscal 2017 decreased 1%, or $0.5 billion, to $55.1 billion; net income attributable to disney decreased 4%, or $0.4 billion, to $9.0 billion; and diluted earnings per share attributable to disney (eps) decreased 1%, or $0.04 to $5.69. the eps decrease in fiscal 2017 was due to lower segment operating income at media networks, studio entertainment and consumer products & interactive media and higher net interest expense. these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program, higher operating income at parks and resorts and a decrease in the effective tax rate. in addition, net income attributable to disney reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decline due to the movement of the u.s. dollar against major currencies including the impact of our hedging program (fx impact).
revenues service revenues for fiscal 2017 decreased 1%, or $0.3 billion, to $46.8 billion, due to declines in revenue from theatrical and home entertainment distribution, advertising and merchandise licensing. these decreases were partially offset by the benefit from a full year of operations at shanghai disney resort, which opened in june 2016, an increase in affiliate fees and higher average guest spending and attendance growth at our other parks and resorts. service revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decline due to an unfavorable fx impact.
product revenues for fiscal 2017 decreased 2%, or $0.2 billion, to $8.3 billion, due to lower volumes at our home entertainment distribution and retail businesses and the discontinuation of infinity, partially offset by the impact of a full year of operations at shanghai disney resort and higher average guest spending and volumes at our other parks and resorts. product revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decline due to an unfavorable fx impact.
costs and expenses cost of services for fiscal 2017 increased 3%, or $0.7 billion, to $25.3 billion, due to higher sports programming costs, a full year of operations at shanghai disney resort and new guest offerings and inflation at our other parks and resorts. these increases were partially offset by lower film cost amortization and theatrical distribution costs.
cost of products for fiscal 2017 decreased 7%, or $0.4 billion, to $5.0 billion, due to the discontinuation of infinity, the absence of the infinity charge (see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements) and lower retail and home entertainment volumes. these decreases were partially offset by a full year of operations at shanghai disney resort and inflation at our domestic parks and resorts.
selling, general, administrative and other costs for the fiscal year decreased 7%, or $0.6 billion, to $8.2 billion, due to lower theatrical marketing costs and the discontinuation of infinity. selling, general, administrative and other costs reflected an approximate 1 percentage point benefit due to a favorable fx impact.
depreciation and amortization costs increased 10%, or $0.3 billion, to $2.8 billion primarily due to a full year of operations at shanghai disney resort and depreciation associated with new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts.
table of contents restructuring and impairment charges the company recorded $98 million and $156 million of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. charges in fiscal 2017 were due to severance costs and asset impairments. charges in fiscal 2016 were due to asset impairments and severance and contract termination costs.

interest and investment income           122                94       30            %
the increase in interest expense was due to higher average debt balances, lower capitalized interest and an increase in our effective interest rate.
the increase in interest and investment income for the year was primarily due to an increase in interest income driven by an increase in average cash balances in interest bearing accounts and higher interest rates.
equity in the income of investees equity in the income of investees decreased 65% or $606 million, to $0.3 billion due to the absence of the $332 million vice gain (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), which was recognized in the prior year, and higher losses from our investments in bamtech and hulu. the bamtech results reflected a valuation adjustment to sports programming rights that were prepaid prior to our acquisition of bamtech and increased costs for technology platform investments. the decrease at hulu was due to higher programming, distribution, marketing and labor costs, partially offset by growth in advertising and subscription revenues.

effective income tax rate   32.1   %      34.2   %   2.1                   ppt the decrease in the effective income tax rate was due to lower tax on foreign earnings, a favorable impact from the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement related to the tax impact of employee share-based awards ($125 million) (see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements) and an increase in the benefit related to qualified domestic production activities. these decreases were partially offset by a benefit in the prior year from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. the lower tax on foreign earnings was driven by a decrease in foreign losses for which we are not recognizing a tax benefit.
table of contents noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year decreased $13 million to $386 million due to the impact of lower net income at espn, partially offset by the impact of improved results at shanghai disney resort.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties and management fees, financing costs and income taxes.
revenues for fiscal 2016 increased 6%, or $3.2 billion, to $55.6 billion; net income attributable to disney increased 12%, or $1.0 billion, to $9.4 billion; and eps for the year increased 17%, or $0.83 to $5.73. the eps increase in fiscal 2016 was due to segment operating income growth at studio entertainment, parks and resorts and consumer products & interactive media, a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program, a decrease in our effective income tax rate, which reflected a deferred tax asset write-off in fiscal 2015, and the benefit of the vice gain. these increases were partially offset by higher net interest expense, the infinity charge (see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements) and higher restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2016. in addition, net income attributable to disney reflected an approximate 5 percentage point decline due to an unfavorable fx impact.
fiscal 2016 included fifty-two weeks of operations, while fiscal 2015 results included the benefit from a fifty-third week of operations (fiscal period impact) due to the timing of our fiscal period end. the estimated eps impact of the additional week of operations in fiscal 2015 was approximately $0.13, and the majority of the impact was at our cable networks business, followed by our parks and resorts and, to a lesser extent, consumer products businesses.
revenues service revenues for fiscal 2016 increased 7%, or $3.2 billion, to $47.1 billion, due to higher theatrical distribution revenues. the increase in service revenues was also driven by growth in merchandise and game licensing revenue, higher average guest spending and attendance at our domestic parks and resorts and higher affiliate fees. additionally, growth in tv/svod, revenues from the opening of shanghai disney resort, growth in digital distribution of film content and higher advertising revenue contributed to the increase in service revenue. these increases were partially offset by lower attendance at disneyland paris. service revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to an unfavorable fx impact.
product revenues for fiscal 2016 decreased 1%, or $69 million, to $8.5 billion, due to the discontinuation of infinity and lower retail store volumes, partially offset by higher average guest spending at our domestic parks and resorts, higher net effective pricing at home entertainment and revenues from the opening of shanghai disney resort. product revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decline due to an unfavorable fx impact.
costs and expenses cost of services for fiscal 2016 increased 6%, or $1.5 billion, to $24.7 billion, due to higher film cost amortization and distribution expense, increased media programming and production costs, the impact of the opening of shanghai disney resort and cost inflation and higher infrastructure and labor costs at our domestic parks and resorts. these increases were partially offset by efficiency initiatives at our domestic parks and resorts. cost of services reflected an approximate 1 percentage point benefit due to a favorable fx impact.
cost of products for fiscal 2016 increased 3%, or $167 million, to $5.3 billion, due to the infinity charge, higher guest spending and cost inflation at our domestic parks and resorts and higher film cost amortization due to home entertainment revenue growth, partially offset by lower costs from the discontinuation of infinity.
selling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2016 increased 3%, or $231 million, to $8.8 billion, driven by increased theatrical marketing costs, partially offset by lower marketing spend for our cable channels. selling, general, administrative and other costs reflected an approximate 1 percentage point benefit due to a favorable fx impact.
depreciation and amortization costs increased 7%, or $173 million, to $2.5 billion due to the opening of shanghai disney resort and depreciation of new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts.

the increase in interest expense was due to higher average debt balances and an increase in our effective interest rate, partially offset by higher capitalized interest.
the decrease in interest and investment income was due to lower gains on sales of investments.
equity in the income of investees equity in the income of investees increased 14% or $112 million, to $0.9 billion due to the $332 million vice gain. the benefit of the vice gain was partially offset by a higher loss at hulu and lower operating results at a+e. the increased equity loss at hulu was due to higher programming, marketing and labor costs, partially offset by growth in subscription and advertising revenues. the decrease at a+e was due to lower advertising revenue and the impact of the conversion of the h2 channel to viceland.

effective income tax rate   34.2   %      36.2   %   2.0                     ppt the decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to a write-off of a $399 million deferred income tax asset in fiscal 2015 as a result of the increase in the company's ownership of euro disney s.c.a. in connection with the disneyland paris recapitalization (disneyland paris tax asset write-off) (see notes 6 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion). this decrease was partially offset by an increase in foreign losses for which we are not recognizing a tax benefit.
noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2016 decreased $71 million to $399 million due to higher pre-opening expenses at shanghai disney resort and a decrease related to disneyland paris, partially offset by higher results at espn. the decrease related to disneyland paris was driven by lower results, partially offset by the impact of an increase in the company's ownership interest.

the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the overall performance of the operating businesses. aggregate segment operating income is not a financial measure defined by gaap, should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant gaap financial measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. the company believes that information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the company's portfolio of businesses separate from factors other than business operations that affect net income.
the following table reconciles segment operating income to income before income taxes.

the decrease in advertising revenues was due to decreases of $192 million at broadcasting, from $4,058 million to $3,866 million and $188 million at cable networks, from $4,451 million to $4,263 million. the decrease at broadcasting was due to decreases of 8% from lower network impressions and 1% from the absence of the emmy awards show, partially offset by an increase of 6% from higher network rates. the decrease at cable networks was due to decreases of 6% from lower impressions and 1% from other advertising, partially offset by an increase of 3% from higher rates. the decrease in impressions at cable networks and broadcasting was due to lower average viewership.
costs and expenses operating expenses include programming and production costs, which increased $559 million from $12,363 million to $12,922 million. at cable networks, programming and production costs increased $636 million due to rate increases for nba and, to a lesser extent, nfl and college sports programming. at broadcasting, programming and production costs decreased $77 million due to lower program sales.
selling, general, administrative and other costs decreased $58 million from $2,705 million to $2,647 million due to lower marketing costs at cable networks and a favorable fx impact.
the decrease in depreciation and amortization was driven by lower depreciation for broadcasting equipment.
equity in the income of investees income from equity investees decreased $253 million from $597 million to $344 million due to higher losses from our investments in bamtech and hulu. bamtech results reflected a valuation adjustment to sports programming rights that were prepaid prior to our acquisition of bamtech and increased costs for technology platform investments. the decrease at hulu was due to higher programming, distribution, marketing and labor costs, partially offset by growth in advertising and subscription revenues.
segment operating income segment operating income decreased 11%, or $853 million, to $6,902 million due to a decrease at espn and lower income from equity investees.

during fiscal 2015, other investing activities reflected $20 million of cash proceeds reflecting $166 million from the sale of investments and other assets, partially offset by contributions to joint ventures of $151 million.
financing activities cash used in financing activities was $9.0 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $7.2 billion in fiscal 2016. the net use of cash in the current year was due to $9.4 billion of common stock repurchases and $2.4 billion in dividends, partially offset by net borrowings of $3.7 billion. the increase in cash used in financing activities compared to fiscal 2016 was due to higher common stock repurchases ($9.4 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $7.5 billion in fiscal 2016).
cash used in financing activities was $7.2 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $5.8 billion in fiscal 2015. the net use of cash in fiscal 2016 was due to $7.5 billion of common stock repurchases and $2.3 billion in dividends, partially offset by net
table of contents borrowings of $2.9 billion. the increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was due to higher common stock repurchases ($7.5 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $6.1 billion in fiscal 2015).
during the year ended september 30, 2017, the company's borrowing activity was as follows:

(2)   see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of bamtech.
(3)   the other activity is due to market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges.
see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company's bank facilities. the company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities, in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due.
see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the company's dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015.
we believe that the company's financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. however, the company's operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. see "item 1a - risk factors". in addition to macroeconomic factors, the company's borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the company's performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. as of september 30, 2017, moody's investors service's long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a2 and p-1, respectively, with stable outlook; standard & poor's long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a+ and a-1+, respectively, with stable outlook; and fitch's long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a and f-1, respectively, with stable outlook. the company's bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the company met on september 30, 2017, by a significant margin. the company's bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the international theme parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default.
contractual obligations, commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the company has various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. for example, the company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at september 30, 2017 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. in addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings based on their contractual maturities.
table of contents additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, as referenced in the table:

commitments not recorded on the balance sheet      65,709
the company also has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement medical benefit plans. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
contingent commitments and contractual guarantees see notes 3, 6 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company's contingent commitments and contractual guarantees.
legal and tax matters as disclosed in notes 9 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the company has exposure for certain tax and legal matters.
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. for a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
film and television revenues and costs we expense film and television production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (ultimate revenues) for each production. if our estimate of ultimate revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. conversely, if our estimate of ultimate revenues increases, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. for film productions, ultimate revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release. for television series, ultimate revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.
with respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is theatrical performance. revenues derived from
table of contents other markets subsequent to the theatrical release (e.g., the home entertainment or television markets) have historically been highly correlated with the theatrical performance. theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. upon a film's release and determination of the theatrical performance, the company's estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for released films is the level of expected home entertainment sales. home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home entertainment products, as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products.
with respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of ultimate revenues are program ratings and the strength of the advertising market. program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the company's ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program. in addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the licensing of program rights worldwide to television distributors, svod services and in home entertainment formats. alternatively, poor ratings may result in cancellation of the program, which would require an immediate write-down of any unamortized production costs. a significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates.
we expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired series, movies and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life, as appropriate. amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. the number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program's ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. we amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. the estimated value of each year is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. if the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season's estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. if planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.
costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments, which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. the net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. the company's dayparts are: primetime, daytime, late night, news and sports (includes broadcast and cable networks). the net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable network. individual programs are written off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program. estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required.
revenue recognition the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies.
we reduce home entertainment revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives. these estimates are based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products. if we underestimate the level of returns or sales incentives in a particular period, we may record less revenue in later periods when returns or sales incentives exceed the estimated amount. conversely, if we overestimate the level of returns or sales incentives for a period, we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns or sales incentives are less than estimated.
we recognize revenues from advance theme park ticket sales when the tickets are used. revenues from annual pass sales are recognized ratably over the period for which the pass is available for use.
pension and postretirement medical plan actuarial assumptions the company's pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.
table of contents the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. the guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. we increased our discount rate to 3.88% at the end of fiscal 2017 from 3.73% at the end of fiscal 2016 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2017 year end measurement date. the company's discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of plans' liability cash flows to the yield curves. a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2018 by approximately $263 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at september 30, 2017 by approximately $2.8 billion. a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $242 million and $2.3 billion, respectively.
to determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. our expected return on plan assets is 7.50%. a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense, while a higher expected rate of return on pension plan assets will decrease pension expense. a one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2018 annual benefit expense by approximately $127 million.
goodwill, other intangible assets, long-lived assets and investments the company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
to determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. the discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. we include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value. these amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results. we believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.
in times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the company's long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.
the company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.
the company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. the impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying value of the asset group. an asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. if the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group's long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group's long-lived assets. the impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. for assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset's fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. if we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.
table of contents the company has cost and equity investments. the fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. in assessing the potential impairment of these investments, we consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and market values, where available. if these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value, impairment charges may be required.
the company tested its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, long-lived assets and investments for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $22 million, $7 million and $10 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. these impairment charges were recorded in "restructuring and impairment charges" in the consolidated statements of income.
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. in times of domestic or global economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods.
contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings. these estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate. from time to time, we may also be involved in other contingent matters for which we have accrued estimates for a probable and estimable loss. it is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.
income tax audits as a matter of course, the company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. the tax benefits ultimately realized by the company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the company's decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the company's success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.
new accounting pronouncements see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.
forward-looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. we may from time to time make written or oral statements that are "forward-looking," including statements contained in this report and other filings with the sec and in reports to our shareholders. such statements may, for example, express expectations or projections about future actions that we may take, including restructuring or strategic initiatives, or about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions. these statements are made on the basis of management's views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements. there can be no assurance, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass. significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under item 1a - risk factors of this report on form 10-k.

2018 operations summary net income attributable to hca healthcare, inc. totaled $3.787 billion, or $10.66 per diluted share, for 2018, compared to $2.216 billion, or $5.95 per diluted share, for 2017. the 2018 results include net gains on sales of facilities of $428 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, and losses on retirement of debt of $9 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. the 2017 results include net gains on sales of facilities of $8 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, and losses on retirement of debt of $39 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. the 2018 results include a reduction in our provision for income taxes of $551 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, on net income attributable to hca healthcare, inc., excluding gains on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, related to the impact of the tax act, $484 million due to a reduction in the effective tax rate and $67 million for the remeasurement of certain of our deferred tax assets and liabilities for which we were unable to record reasonable estimates in 2017. the 2017 results include an increase in the provision for income taxes of $301 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the enactment of the tax act. during 2018, we recorded a reduction to the provision for professional liability risks of $70 million, or $0.15 per diluted share. during 2018, we recorded additional expenses and losses of revenues estimated at approximately $31 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, associated with the impact of hurricane michael on our florida facilities. during 2017, we recorded additional expenses and losses of revenues estimated at approximately $140 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, associated with the impact of hurricanes harvey and irma on our texas, florida, georgia and south carolina facilities. both of these amounts are prior to any insurance recoveries. during 2018, we recorded a benefit of $49 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, from an insurance recovery related to hurricane harvey business interruption losses incurred during 2017, and we recorded a reduction to the provision for income taxes of $28 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for tax credits related to certain 2017 hurricane-related expenses. our provisions for income taxes for 2018 and 2017 included tax benefits of $124 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, and $82 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, respectively, related to employee equity award settlements. all per diluted share disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. shares used for diluted earnings per share were 355.303 million shares and 372.221 million shares for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. during 2018 and 2017, we repurchased 14.070 million and 25.092 million shares, respectively, of our common stock.
revenues increased to $46.677 billion for 2018 from $43.614 billion for 2017. revenues increased 7.0% and 6.5%, respectively, on a consolidated basis and on a same facility basis for 2018, compared to 2017. the consolidated revenues increase can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 2.8% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 4.1% increase in equivalent admissions. the same facility revenues increase resulted primarily from a 3.9% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 2.5% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  (continued)
during 2018, consolidated admissions increased 3.5% and same facility admissions increased 2.5%, compared to 2017. inpatient surgical volumes increased 1.5% on a consolidated basis and increased 0.8% on a same facility basis during 2018, compared to 2017. outpatient surgical volumes increased 3.2% on a consolidated basis and increased 1.8% on a same facility basis during 2018, compared to 2017. emergency room visits increased 1.6% on a consolidated basis and increased 0.1% on a same facility basis during 2018, compared to 2017.
total uncompensated care increased $3.337 billion for 2018, compared to 2017. total uncompensated care as a percentage of the sum of revenues and total uncompensated care was 36.4% for 2018, compared to 34.9% for 2017. same facility uninsured admissions increased 8.5% and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 3.8% for 2018, compared to 2017. same facility uninsured admissions increased 5.9% and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 2.4% for 2017, compared to 2016.
cash flows from operating activities increased $1.335 billion, from $5.426 billion for 2017 to $6.761 billion for 2018. the increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily related to the increase in net income, excluding gains on sales of facilities, of $1.226 billion.
business strategy we are committed to providing the communities we serve with high quality, cost-effective health care while growing our business and creating long-term value for our stockholders. to achieve these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda:
grow our presence in existing markets. we believe we are well positioned in a number of large and growing markets that will allow us the opportunity to generate long-term, attractive growth through the expansion of our presence in these markets. we plan to continue recruiting and strategically collaborating with the physician community and developing comprehensive service lines such as cardiology, neurology, oncology, orthopedics and womens services. additional components of our growth strategy include providing access and convenience through developing various outpatient facilities, including, but not limited to surgery centers, urgent care clinics, freestanding emergency care facilities and imaging centers.
achieve industry-leading performance in clinical and satisfaction measures. achieving high levels of patient safety, patient satisfaction and clinical quality are central goals of our business model. to achieve these goals, we have implemented a number of initiatives including infection reduction initiatives, hospitalist programs, advanced health information technology and evidence-based medicine programs. we routinely analyze operational practices from our best-performing hospitals to identify ways to implement organization-wide performance improvements and reduce clinical variation. we believe these initiatives will continue to improve patient care, help us achieve cost efficiencies and favorably position us in an environment where our constituents are increasingly focused on quality, efficacy and efficiency.
recruit and employ physicians to meet the needs for high quality health services. we depend on the quality and dedication of the health care providers and other team members who serve at our facilities. we believe a critical component of our growth strategy is our ability to successfully recruit and strategically collaborate with physicians and other professionals to provide high quality care. we attract and retain physicians
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  (continued)
by providing high quality, convenient facilities with advanced technology, by expanding our specialty services and by building our outpatient operations. we believe our continued investment in the employment, recruitment and retention of physicians will improve the quality of care at our facilities.
continue to leverage our scale and market positions to grow the company. we believe there is significant opportunity to continue to grow our company by fully leveraging the scale and scope of our organization. we continue to invest in initiatives such as care navigators, clinical data exchange and centralized patient transfer operations, which will enable us to improve coordination of care and patient retention across our markets. we believe our centrally managed business processes and ability to leverage cost-saving practices across our extensive network will enable us to continue to manage costs effectively. we continue to invest in our parallon subsidiary group to leverage key components of our support infrastructure, including revenue cycle management, health care group purchasing, supply chain management and staffing functions.
pursue a disciplined development strategy. we continue to believe there are significant growth opportunities in our markets. we will continue to provide financial and operational resources to analyze and develop our in-market opportunities. to complement our in-market growth agenda, we intend to focus on selectively developing and acquiring new hospitals, outpatient facilities and other health care service providers. we believe the challenges faced by the hospital industry may continue to spur consolidation and we believe our size, scale, national presence and access to capital will position us well to participate in any such consolidation.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known. actual results may differ from these estimates.
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  (continued)
critical accounting policies and estimates  (continued)
invested significant resources to refine and improve our billing systems and the information system data used to make contractual allowance estimates. we have developed standardized calculation processes and related employee training programs to improve the utility of our patient accounting systems.
the emergency medical treatment and labor act (emtala) requires any hospital participating in the medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospitals emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. the obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individuals ability to pay for treatment. federal and state laws and regulations, including but not limited to emtala, require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care encourages, the provision of services to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive.
prior to november 2017, patients treated at hospitals for non-elective care, who have income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, were eligible for charity care. during november 2017, we expanded our charity policy to include patients who have income above 200%, but at or below 400%, of the federal poverty level and we limit the patient responsibility amounts for these patients to a percentage of their annual household income, computed on a sliding scale based upon their annual income and the applicable percentage of the federal poverty level. the federal poverty level is established by the federal government and is based on income and family size. because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in revenues. we provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care. in implementing the uninsured discount policy, we may first attempt to provide assistance to uninsured patients to help determine whether they may qualify for medicaid, other federal or state assistance, or charity care. if an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.
due to the complexities involved in the classification and documentation of health care services authorized and provided, the estimation of revenues earned and the related reimbursement are often subject to interpretations that could result in payments that are different from our estimates. adjustments to estimated medicare and medicaid reimbursement amounts and disproportionate-share funds, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during the respective year were $29 million, $41 million and $31 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during previous years were $51 million, $56 million and $90 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. we expect adjustments during the next 12 months related to medicare and medicaid cost report filings and settlements will result in increases to revenues generally similar to the amounts recorded during these years.
the collection of outstanding receivables for medicare, medicaid, managed care payers, other third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. the primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. implicit price concessions relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. estimated implicit price concessions are recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts. accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been performed.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  (continued)
critical accounting policies and estimates  (continued)
the estimates for implicit price concessions are based upon managements assessment of historical writeoffs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and collections at facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and accounts receivable (the hindsight analysis) as a primary source of information in estimating the collectability of our accounts receivable. we perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. we believe our quarterly updates to the estimated implicit price concession amounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable estimates of our revenues and valuations of our accounts receivable. these routine, quarterly changes in estimates have not resulted in material adjustments to the valuations of our accounts receivable or period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations. at december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, estimated implicit price concessions of $6.280 billion and $5.488 billion, respectively, had been recorded as reductions to our accounts receivable balances to enable us to record our revenues and accounts receivable at the estimated amounts we expect to collect.
to quantify the total impact of and trends related to uninsured accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view total uncompensated care, which is comprised of charity care, uninsured discounts and implicit price concessions. a summary of the estimated cost of total uncompensated care for the years ended december 31, follows (dollars in millions):
patient care costs (salaries and benefits, supplies, other operating expenses and depreciation and         $40,035             $37,557             $35,304
total uncompensated care as a percentage of the sum of revenues and total uncompensated care was 36.4% for 2018, 34.9% for 2017 and 33.0% for 2016. days revenues in accounts receivable were 51 days, 52 days and 50 days at december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. management expects a continuation of the challenges related to the collection of the patient due accounts. adverse changes in the percentage of our patients having adequate health care coverage, increases in patient responsibility amounts under certain health care coverages, general economic conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer mix, or trends in federal, state, and private employer health care coverage could affect the collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations.
professional liability claims we, along with virtually all health care providers, operate in an environment with professional liability risks. our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence, subject, in most cases, to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. the insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  (continued)

professional liability claims  (continued)
$25 million per occurrence. we purchase excess insurance on a claims-made basis for losses in excess of $50 million per occurrence. provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $447 million, $466 million and $430 million for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. during 2018, we recorded a reduction to the provision for professional liability risks of $70 million due to the receipt of updated actuarial information.
reserves for professional liability risks represent the estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. the estimated ultimate cost includes estimates of direct expenses and fees paid to outside counsel and experts, but does not include the general overhead costs of our insurance subsidiary or corporate office. individual case reserves are established based upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimates of the future costs that will be paid on reported claims. case reserves are reduced as claim payments are made and are adjusted upward or downward as our estimates regarding the amounts of future losses are revised. once the case reserves for known claims are determined, information is stratified by loss layers and retentions, accident years, reported years, and geographic location of our hospitals. several actuarial methods are employed to utilize this data to produce estimates of ultimate losses and reserves for incurred but not reported claims, including: paid and incurred extrapolation methods utilizing paid and incurred loss development to estimate ultimate losses; frequency and severity methods utilizing paid and incurred claims development to estimate ultimate average frequency (number of claims) and ultimate average severity (cost per claim); and bornhuetter-ferguson methods which add expected development to actual paid or incurred experience to estimate ultimate losses. these methods use our company-specific historical claims data and other information. company-specific claim reporting and payment data collected over an approximate 20-year period is used in our reserve estimation process. this company-specific data includes information regarding our business, including historical paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, historical and current case loss reserves, actual and projected hospital statistical data, professional liability retentions for each policy year, geographic information and other data.
reserves and provisions for professional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. the estimated reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under reinsurance contracts, were $1.514 billion to $1.814 billion at december 31, 2018 and $1.456 billion to $1.743 billion at december 31, 2017. our estimated reserves for professional liability claims may change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends. we perform sensitivity analyses which model the volatility of key actuarial assumptions and monitor our reserves for adequacy relative to all our assumptions in the aggregate. based on our analysis, we believe the estimated professional liability reserve ranges represent the reasonably likely outcomes for ultimate losses. we consider the number and severity of claims to be the most significant assumptions in estimating reserves for professional liabilities. a 2.5% change in the expected frequency trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $31 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $29 million. a 2.5% change in the expected claim severity trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $110 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $101 million. we believe adequate reserves have been recorded for our professional liability claims; however, due to the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to resolve the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes, our ultimate liability for professional liability claims could change by more than the estimated sensitivity amounts and could change materially from our current estimates.
the reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately 2,200 and 2,500 individual claims at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and estimates for unreported potential claims. the time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated. the average time period between the occurrence and final resolution for our professional liability

reserves for professional liability risks were $1.741 billion and $1.627 billion at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the current portion of these reserves, $466 million and $429 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, is included in other accrued expenses. obligations covered by reinsurance and excess insurance contracts are included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not meet their obligations. reserves for professional liability risks (net of $50 million and $24 million receivable under reinsurance and excess insurance contracts at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively) were $1.692 billion and $1.603 billion at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the estimated total net reserves for professional liability risks at december 31, 2018 and 2017 are comprised of $703 million and $751 million, respectively, of case reserves for known claims and $989 million and $852 million, respectively, of reserves for incurred but not reported claims.
changes in our professional liability reserves, net of reinsurance recoverable, for the years ended december 31, are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):
net reserves for professional liability claims, january 1                   $1,603              $1,494              $1,421
net reserves for professional liability claims, december 31                 $1,692              $1,603              $1,494
income taxes we calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences that arise from the recognition of items in different periods for tax and accounting purposes. deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effects of amounts expensed in our income statement for which tax deductions will be claimed in future periods. interest and penalties payable to taxing authorities are included as a component of our provision for income taxes. we have elected to treat taxes incurred on global intangible low-taxed income as a period expense.
although we believe we have properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws, federal, state or foreign taxing authorities may challenge our tax positions upon audit. significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of uncertain tax positions. we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our income tax returns. during each reporting period, we assess the facts and circumstances related to uncertain tax positions. if the realization of unrecognized tax benefits is deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances, the estimated liability and the provision for income taxes are reduced in the current period. final audit results may vary from our estimates.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  (continued)
results of operations revenue/volume trends our revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charge and negotiated payment rates for such services. gross charges typically do not reflect what our facilities are actually paid. our facilities have entered into agreements with third-party payers, including government programs and managed care health plans, under which the facilities are paid based upon the cost of providing services, predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or discounts from gross charges. we do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues. we provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care.
same facility revenues increased 6.5% for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 and increased 3.8% for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the 6.5% increase for 2018 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 3.9% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 2.5% increase in same facility equivalent admissions. the 3.8% increase for 2017 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 2.2% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.5% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.
consolidated admissions increased 3.5% during 2018 compared to 2017 and increased 2.4% during 2017 compared to 2016. consolidated surgeries increased 2.6% during 2018 compared to 2017 and increased 0.8% during 2017 compared to 2016. consolidated emergency room visits increased 1.6% during 2018 compared to 2017 and increased 2.9% during 2017 compared to 2016.
same facility admissions increased 2.5% during 2018 compared to 2017 and increased 1.1% during 2017 compared to 2016. same facility surgeries increased 1.4% during 2018 compared to 2017 and declined 0.7% during 2017 compared to 2016. same facility emergency room visits increased 0.1% during 2018 compared to 2017 and increased 1.4% during 2017 compared to 2016.
same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 3.8% and same facility uninsured admissions increased 8.5% during 2018 compared to 2017. same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 2.4% and same facility uninsured admissions increased 5.9% during 2017 compared to 2016.

at december 31, 2018, we owned and operated 45 hospitals and 32 surgery centers in the state of florida. our florida facilities revenues totaled $10.892 billion, $10.168 billion and $9.522 billion for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. at december 31, 2018, we owned and operated 47 hospitals and 29 surgery centers in the state of texas. our texas facilities revenues totaled $12.023 billion, $10.634 billion and $9.898 billion for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. during 2018, 2017 and 2016, 57%, 56% and 56% of our admissions and 49%, 48% and 47%, respectively, of our revenues were generated by our florida and texas facilities. uninsured admissions in florida and texas represented 70%, 70% and 69% of our uninsured admissions during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
we receive a significant portion of our revenues from government health programs, principally medicare and medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. in december 2017, the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) announced that it will phase out federal matching funds for designated state health programs under waivers granted under section 1115 of the social security act. texas currently operates its healthcare transformation and quality improvement program pursuant to a medicaid waiver. in december 2017, cms approved an extension of this waiver through september 30, 2022, but indicated that it will phase out some of the federal funding. our texas medicaid revenues included medicaid supplemental waiver payments of $450 million, $351 million and $370 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  (continued)
in addition, we receive supplemental payments in several other states. we are aware these supplemental payment programs are currently being reviewed by certain state agencies and some states have made waiver requests to cms to replace their existing supplemental payment programs. it is possible these reviews and waiver requests will result in the restructuring of such supplemental payment programs and could result in the payment programs being reduced or eliminated. because deliberations about these programs are ongoing, we are unable to estimate the financial impact the program structure modifications, if any, may have on our results of operations.

(a)                we have not included obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits of $435 million at december 31, 2018, as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of cash payments, if any, at this time.
(c)                              the estimation of the timing of payments for professional liability claims beyond a year can vary significantly. the time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated.
(d)                   amounts relate to future operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other obligations and are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. amounts also include physician commitments that are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet.
(e)                                                     amounts relate primarily to instances in which we have agreed to indemnify various commercial insurers and lenders who have provided surety bonds and letters of credit to cover damages for legal cases which were awarded to plaintiffs by the courts, medicaid provider bonds, and utility and construction deposits.
(f)                                                                       in consideration for physicians relocating to the communities in which our hospitals are located and agreeing to engage in private practice for the benefit of the respective communities, we make advances to physicians, normally over a period of one year, to assist in establishing the physicians practices. the actual amount of these commitments to be advanced often depends upon the financial results of the physicians private practice during the recruitment agreement payment period. the physician commitments reflected were based on our maximum exposure on effective agreements at december 31, 2018.
market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. the investments in our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries were $409 million at december 31, 2018. these investments are carried at

fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. at december 31, 2018, we had a net unrealized gain of $3 million on the insurance subsidiaries investment securities.
we are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. investments in debt and equity securities of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. should the 100% owned insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairments on our investment securities in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue-specific factors.
we are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. the notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities. our credit risk related to these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions. the interest payments under these agreements are settled on a net basis. these derivatives have been recognized in the financial statements at their respective fair values. changes in the fair value of these derivatives, which are designated as cash flow hedges, are included in other comprehensive income.
with respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, approximately $4.341 billion of long-term debt at december 31, 2018 was subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining balance in long-term debt of $28.480 billion at december 31, 2018 was subject to fixed rates of interest. both the general level of interest rates and, for the senior secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable interest rates. our variable debt is comprised primarily of amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities. borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (2) the prime rate of bank of america or (b) a libor rate for the currency of such borrowing for the relevant interest period. the applicable margin for borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities may fluctuate according to a leverage ratio. the average effective interest rate for our long-term debt was 5.3% for both 2018 and 2017.
the estimated fair value of our total long-term debt was $32.887 billion at december 31, 2018. the estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities. based on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates, the potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would be approximately $43 million. to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, we generally target a majority of our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates.
we are exposed to currency translation risk related to our foreign operations. we currently do not consider the market risk related to foreign currency translation to be material to our consolidated financial statements or our liquidity.

financial instruments derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks, including interest rate exposures, and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. we recognize derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically either in earnings or in stockholders equity, as a component of other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the hedged items when they occur.
effects of inflation and changing prices various federal, state and local laws have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices. revenues for general, acute care hospital services rendered to medicare patients are established under the federal governments prospective payment system. total fee-for-service medicare revenues were 21.1%, 21.3% and 21.0% of our revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
management believes hospital industry operating margins have been, and may continue to be, under significant pressure because of changes in payer and service mix and growth in operating expenses in excess of the increase in prospective payments under the medicare program. in addition, as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures, our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to non-medicare patients is limited.
tax examinations during 2016, the irs completed its examination, resolving all outstanding federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years. we are subject to examination by the irs for tax years after 2014 as well as by state and foreign taxing authorities.
management believes hca healthcare, inc., its predecessors and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the irs, state and foreign taxing authorities and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. however, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

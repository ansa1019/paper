our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist readers in understanding our financial information from our management's perspective and is presented as follows:
•   overview
•   non-gaap financial measures
•   liquidity and capital resources
•   critical accounting policies and estimates
•   recent accounting pronouncements in 2018, as more fully described in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, we sold 930,934 shares of our common stock for approximately $388.2 million, net of payment of commissions to the sales agents and estimated equity offering costs under our atm program launched in 2017 (the "2017 atm program"). as of december 31, 2018, no shares remained available for sale under the 2017 atm program. in december 2018, we launched another atm program, under which we may offer and sell from time to time up to an aggregate of $750.0 million of our common stock in "at the market" transactions (the "2018 atm program"). as of december 31, 2018, no sales have been made under the 2018 atm program.
in july 2018, as more fully described in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, we entered into an amendment to our existing credit agreement to add a senior unsecured term loan in an aggregate principal amount of ¥47.5 billion (the "jpy term loan"). concurrent with the closing of our jpy term loan, we drew down the full ¥47.5 billion of the jpy term loan, or approximately $424.7 million, and prepaid the remaining principal of our existing japanese yen term loan of ¥43.8 billion, or approximately $391.3 million. we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $2.2 million during the third quarter of 2018 in connection therewith.
in april 2018, as more fully described in note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, we completed the acquisition of metronode for a cash purchase price of a$1.034 billion or approximately $804.6 million at the exchange rate in effect on april 18, 2018 (the "metronode acquisition"). we accounted for this transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. the valuation and purchase accounting of this acquisition have not yet been finalized as of december 31, 2018.
in april 2018, as more fully described in note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, we completed the acquisition of infomart dallas for total consideration of approximately $804.0 million (the "infomart dallas acquisition"), consisting of approximately $45.8 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments, and $758.2 million aggregate fair value of 5.000% senior unsecured notes. we accounted for this transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. the valuation and purchase accounting of this acquisition have not yet been finalized as of december 31, 2018.
in march 2018, as more fully described in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, we issued €750.0 million, or approximately $929.9 million in u.s. dollars, at the exchange rate in effect on march 14, 2018, aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior notes due march 15, 2024. we incurred debt issuance costs of $11.6 million related to the 2.875% euro senior notes due 2024.
overview equinix provides global data center offerings that protect and connect the world's most valued information assets. global enterprises, financial services companies and content and network service providers rely upon equinix's leading insight and data centers around the world for the safehousing of their critical it equipment and the ability to directly connect to the networks that enable today's information-driven economy. the acquisitions of infomart dallas and metronode expanded our total global footprint to 200 ibx data centers across 52 markets around the world. equinix offers the following solutions: (i) premium data center colocation, (ii) interconnection and exchange and (iii) outsourced it infrastructure solutions. as of december 31, 2018, we operated or had partner ibx data centers in brazil, canada, colombia and throughout the u.s. in the americas region; bulgaria, finland, france, germany, ireland, italy, the netherlands, poland, portugal, spain, sweden, switzerland, turkey, the united arab emirates and the united kingdom in the emea region; and australia, china, hong kong, indonesia, japan and singapore in the asia-pacific region.
our data centers in 52 markets around the world are a global platform, which allows our customers to increase information and application delivery performance while significantly reducing costs. this global platform and the quality of our ibx data centers have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. as more customers choose our ibx data centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate with us as well, in order to gain the full economic and performance benefits of our offerings. these partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a "marketplace" for their services. our global platform enables scalable, reliable and cost-effective colocation, interconnection and traffic exchange that lowers overall cost and increases flexibility. our focused business model is built on our critical mass of customers and the resulting "marketplace" effect. this global platform, combined with our strong financial position, continues to drive new customer growth and bookings.
historically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled telecommunications products and services with their colocation offerings. the data center market landscape has evolved to include cloud computing/utility providers, application hosting providers and systems integrators, managed infrastructure hosting providers and colocation providers. more than 350 companies provide data center solutions in the u.s. alone. each of these data center solutions providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings and outsourced it infrastructure solutions. we are able to offer our customers a global platform that reaches 24 countries with proven operational reliability, improved application performance, network choice and a highly scalable set of offerings.
our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus net sellable cabinet space available, taking into account power limitations. our utilization rates were approximately 81%, as of december 31, 2018, and 80%, excluding the verizon data center, paris ibx data center, itconic, zenium data center and io acquisitions, as of december 31, 2017. excluding the impact of ibx data center expansion projects that have opened during the last 12 months, our utilization rate would have increased to approximately 83% as of december 31, 2018. our cabinet utilization rate varies from market to market among our ibx data centers across the americas, emea and asia-pacific regions. we continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. to the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. we perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. in addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. as a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain high power-demand customers. this increased power consumption has driven us to build out our new ibx data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous ibx data centers. we could face power limitations in our ibx data centers, even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific ibx data center. this could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given ibx data center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows.
strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and offerings. as was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors, including but not limited to demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to break even on a free cash flow basis and in-place customers. like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to equinix standards. property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant.
our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed infrastructure offerings. we consider these offerings recurring because our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. in addition, during any given quarter of the past three years, more than half of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. our largest customer accounted for approximately 3% of our recurring revenues for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately 38%, 37% and 36%, respectively, of our recurring revenues for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer's initial deployment and professional services we perform. these services are considered to be non-recurring because they are billed typically once, upon completion of the installation or the professional services work performed. the majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. however, revenues from installation services are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of contract term. additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is generally treated as a contract modification and recognized ratably over the remaining term of the contract, if any. as a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future.
the largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased ibx data centers, utility costs, including electricity, bandwidth access, ibx data center employees' salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment and security services. a majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing ibx data centers or open or acquire new ibx data centers. however, there are certain costs that are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. we expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will generally increase in the future on a per-unit or fixed basis, in addition to the variable increase related to the growth in consumption by our customers. in addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months, as compared to other times of the year. to the extent we incur increased utility costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. furthermore, to the extent we incur increased electricity costs as a result of either climate change policies or the physical effects of climate change, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, amortization of contract costs, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer relationship intangible assets.
we expect our cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses to grow in absolute dollars in connection with our business growth. we may periodically see a higher cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue when a large expansion project opens or is acquired, before it starts generating any meaningful revenue. furthermore, in relation to cost of revenues, the americas region has a lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue than either emea or asia-pacific. this is due to both the increased scale and maturity of the americas region, compared to either the emea or asia-pacific region, as well as a higher cost structure outside of the americas, particularly in emea. we expect the trend that the americas having the lowest cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to continue. as a result, to the extent that revenue growth outside the americas grows in greater proportion than revenue growth in the americas, our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may increase in future periods. sales and marketing expenses may periodically increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to scale our operations by investing in sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue, including the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovations. general and administrative expenses may also periodically increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to grow our business.
taxation as a reit we elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 taxable year. as of december 31, 2018, our reit structure included all of our data center operations in the u.s., canada, japan, and the data center operations in emea with the exception of bulgaria, united arab emirates and a portion of turkey. our data center operations in other jurisdictions are operated as trss.
as a reit, we generally are permitted to deduct from our federal taxable income the dividends we pay to our stockholders (including, for this purpose, the value of any deemed distributions attributable to anti-dilution adjustments made with respect to our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes prior to their maturity in 2016). the income represented by such dividends is not subject to federal income tax at the entity level but is taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. nevertheless, the income of our trss which hold our u.s. operations that may not be reit compliant is subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income tax. likewise, our foreign subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through trss or through qrss. we are also subject to a separate corporate income tax on any gain recognized from a sale of a reit asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a c corporation (such as (i) an asset that we held as of the effective date of our reit election, that is, january 1, 2015, or (ii) an asset held by us or a qrs following the liquidation or other conversion of a former trs). this built-in-gains tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a reit asset (e.g., january 1, 2015 in the case of reit assets we held at the time of our reit conversion), to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a reit asset. if we fail to remain qualified for federal income tax as a reit, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate tax rates. even if we remain qualified for federal income tax as a reit, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our trss' operations. in particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the federal income tax regime for reits, many states do not completely follow federal rules and some may not follow them at all.
on each of march 21, june 20, september 19, and december 12, 2018, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $2.28 per share. we expect these quarterly and other applicable distributions to equal or exceed the reit taxable income that we recognized in 2018.
on december 22, 2017, the united states enacted legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act ("tcja") which amended u.s. federal income tax laws. the tcja retained the reit regime but contained many significant changes that impact a reit's taxable income subject to distribution, particularly a reit with global operations. as of the end of 2018, we have finalized the analysis of the major tax impact to our business by the new tax legislation. based on our current assessment, which is subject to further interpretation and guidance on the new tax legislation, we believe that we can continue to meet all the reit compliance requirements in the foreseeable future and that the tcja changes are not expected to meaningfully increase our tax liabilities in the u.s. because we expect to fully distribute our reit taxable income.
we continue to monitor our reit compliance in order to maintain our qualification for federal income tax as a reit. for this and other reasons, as necessary, we may convert some of our data center operations in other countries into the reit structure in future periods.
results of operations our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2018 include the results of operations from the metronode acquisition from april 18, 2018 and the infomart dallas acquisition from april 2, 2018. our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2017 include the results of operations of the io acquisition from february 3, 2017, the verizon data center acquisition from may 1, 2017, the zenium data center acquisition from october 6, 2017 and the itconic acquisition from october 9, 2017. our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2016 include the results of operations of telecitygroup from january 15, 2016 and the paris ibx data center acquisition from august 1, 2016.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers ("asu 2014-09") and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance, collectively referred as "topic 606." on january 1, 2018, as more fully described in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, we adopted topic 606. results for reporting periods beginning after january 1, 2018 are presented under topic 606, while the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under accounting standards in effect for those periods. under the new standard, we recognize installation revenue over the contract period rather than over the estimated installation life as under the prior revenue standard. we also capitalize and amortize certain costs to obtain contracts, rather than expense them immediately as under the previous standard.
discontinued operations we present the results of operations associated with the telecitygroup data centers that were divested in july 2016 as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2016. we did not have any discontinued operations activity during 2018 or 2017.
revenues.    our revenues for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands):
years ended december 31,                          % change
americas revenues. revenues for our americas region for the year ended december 31, 2018 included approximately $210.2 million of incremental revenues from the verizon data center acquisition, which closed in may 2017, and the infomart dallas acquisition, which closed in april 2018. during both the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, our revenues from the united states, the largest revenue contributor in the americas region for the periods, represented approximately 91% of the regional revenues. excluding incremental revenues attributable to the infomart dallas and verizon data center acquisitions, growth in americas revenues was primarily due to (i) $69.3 million of revenues generated from our recently-opened ibx data centers or ibx data center expansions in the chicago, culpeper, denver, houston, miami, rio de janeiro, são paulo, seattle, silicon valley, and washington, d.c. areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. during the year ended december 31, 2018, the u.s. dollar was generally stronger relative to the brazilian real than during the year ended december 31, 2017, resulting in approximately $23.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact on our americas revenues during the year ended december 31, 2018 when compared to 2017 using average exchange rates.
emea revenues.  revenues for our emea region for the year ended december 31, 2018 included approximately $52.6 million of incremental revenues from the io acquisition, which closed in february 2017, and the itconic and zenium data center acquisitions, which closed in october 2017. our revenues from the u.k., our largest revenue contributor in the emea region, represented 30% of regional revenues for both the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017. excluding incremental revenues attributable to the io, itconic, and zenium acquisitions, our emea revenue growth was primarily due to (i) approximately $73.2 million of revenues from our recently-opened ibx data centers or ibx data center expansions in the amsterdam, frankfurt, london and paris metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. during the year ended december 31, 2018, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $54.4 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our emea revenues primarily due to a generally weaker u.s. dollar relative to the euro and british pound during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017.
asia-pacific revenues.  revenues for our asia-pacific region for the year ended december 31, 2018 included approximately $48.0 million of incremental revenues from the metronode acquisition, which closed in april 2018. our revenues from japan and singapore, the largest revenue contributors in the asia-pacific region for the period, combined represented approximately 60% and 63% for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. excluding incremental revenues attributable to the metronode acquisition, our asia-pacific revenue growth was primarily due to (i) approximately $59.2 million of revenues generated from our recently-opened ibx data center expansions in the hong kong, melbourne, osaka, and singapore metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. during the year ended december 31,
2018, the u.s. dollar was generally weaker relative to the singapore dollar and japanese yen than during the year ended december 31, 2017, resulting in approximately $7.7 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our asia-pacific revenues during the year ended december 31, 2018 when compared to 2017 using average exchange rates.
cost of revenues.  our cost of revenues for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):
years ended december 31,                          % change
americas cost of revenues. cost of revenues for our americas region for the year ended december 31, 2018 included approximately $115.4 million of incremental cost of revenues from the verizon data center acquisition and the infomart dallas acquisition. excluding the impact from these acquisitions, the increase in our americas cost of revenues for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily due to (i) $10.6 million higher depreciation expense primarily due to our ibx data center expansion activity; (ii) $7.6 million of higher taxes, licenses, insurance, and other cost of sales in support of our business growth; (iii) $5.8 million of higher rent and facility costs due to new fuel cell leases and ibx growth  and (iv) $15.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and higher headcount growth (1,399 americas cost of revenues employees as of december 31, 2018 versus 1,339 as of december 31, 2017). during the year ended december 31, 2018, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $15.1 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our americas cost of revenues primarily due to a generally stronger u.s. dollar relative to the brazilian real during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. we expect our americas cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business, including results from recent acquisitions.
emea cost of revenues. cost of revenues for our emea region for the year ended december 31, 2018 included $41.5 million of incremental cost of revenues from the io, itconic, and zenium acquisitions. excluding incremental cost of revenues attributable to these acquisitions, the increase in our emea cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $47.3 million of higher utilities costs driven by ibx expansions, increased usage and price increases; (ii) $18.4 million of higher office expenses, rent and facility costs, and repair and maintenance primarily due to an increase in expansion activity and usage due to our business growth; (iii) $49.3 million of higher depreciation and accretion expenses, primarily driven by expansion activity in amsterdam, frankfurt, london, and paris and (iv) $19.7 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and higher headcount growth (1,490 emea cost of revenues employees as of december 31, 2018 versus 1,375 as of december 31, 2017), partially offset by an $11.8 million reduction in other cost of sales, primarily due to realized cash flow hedge gains. during the year ended december 31, 2018, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $30.0 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our emea cost of revenues, primarily due to a generally weaker u.s. dollar relative to the euro and british pound during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. we expect emea cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business.
asia-pacific cost of revenues. cost of revenues for our asia-pacific region for the year ended december 31, 2018 included approximately $33.2 million incremental cost of revenues from the metronode acquisition. excluding the impact from the metronode acquisition, the increase in our asia-pacific cost of revenues for the year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily due to (i) $28.4 million of higher utilities costs, rent and facility costs and repairs and maintenance expense, primarily driven by higher usage in australia, hong kong, japan and singapore; (ii) $16.1 million of higher depreciation and accretion expense, primarily from ibx expansions in australia, hong kong, japan and singapore; (iii) $9.7 million of higher other cost of sales, primarily due
to custom service orders, and (iv) $3.9 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (884 asia-pacific cost of revenues employees as of december 31, 2018 versus 828 as of december 31, 2017). during the year ended december 31, 2018, the u.s. dollar was generally weaker relative to the singapore dollar and japanese yen than during the year ended december 31, 2017, resulting in approximately $3.3 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our asia-pacific cost of revenues in 2018. we expect asia-pacific cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business, including the impact from the metronode acquisition.
sales and marketing expenses. our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):
years ended december 31,                          % change
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues:
americas sales and marketing expenses. the increase in our americas sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to (i) $38.1 million of amortization of the acquired intangible assets in connection with the verizon data center acquisition and (ii) $5.4 million of higher consulting expenses to support our growth. during the year ended december 31, 2018, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our americas sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended december 31, 2017. we anticipate that we will continue to invest in americas sales and marketing initiatives and expect our americas sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we continue to grow our business, including the impact from recent acquisitions.
emea sales and marketing expenses. our emea sales and marketing expense did not materially change during the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. during the year ended december 31, 2018, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.8 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our emea sales and marketing expenses primarily due to a generally weaker u.s. dollar relative to the euro and british pound during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. over the past several years, we have been investing in our emea sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenues. we expect our emea sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we continue to grow our business.
asia-pacific sales and marketing expenses. the increase in our asia-pacific sales and marketing expense is primarily due to (i) $4.1 million of amortization of the acquired intangible assets in connection with the metronode acquisition; (ii) $4.1 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (306 asia-pacific sales and marketing employees as of december 31, 2018, versus 278 as of december 31, 2017) and (iii) $4.4 million of higher bad debt expense, primarily due to customer recovery in the prior year. for the year ended december 31, 2018, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our asia-pacific sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended december 31, 2017. over the past several years, we have been investing in our asia-pacific sales and marketing initiatives and expect our asia-pacific sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we continue to grow our business, including the impact from the metronode acquisition.
general and administrative expenses. our general and administrative expenses for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):

americas general and administrative expenses. the increase in our americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $25.8 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and headcount growth (1,389 americas general and administrative employees as of december 31, 2018 versus 1,207 as of december 31, 2017); (ii) $18.1 million of higher office, rent and facilities costs and consulting expenses in support of our business growth; (iii) $3.8 million of higher recruiting, training, and travel expenses to support employee development and (iv) $30.2 million of higher depreciation expense associated with the implementation of certain systems, including revenue, data management and cloud exchange systems, to improve our quote to order and billing processes and to support the integration and growth of our business. during the year ended december 31, 2018, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our americas general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended december 31, 2017. over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our americas general and administrative functions to scale our business effectively for growth, which has included additional investments in improving our back office systems. we expect our current efforts to improve our back office systems will continue over the next several years. going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect americas general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to further scale our operations to support our growth, including these investments in our back office systems, investments to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit and recent acquisitions and to comply with new accounting standards.
emea general and administrative expenses. the decrease in our emea general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $23.1 million of lower amortization expense as a result of fully amortizing the telecitygroup trade names during the third quarter of 2017; (ii) $5.2 million decrease due to realized cash flow hedge gains and (iii) $5.1 million lower outside services consulting expense, partially offset by an increase of $19.6 million of compensation expenses, including general salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (830 emea general and administrative employees as of december 31, 2018 versus 807 as of december 31, 2017). during the year ended december 31, 2018, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $5.2 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our emea general and administrative expenses primarily due to a generally weaker u.s. dollar relative to the euro and british pound during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our emea general and administrative functions as a result of our ongoing efforts to scale this region effectively for growth. going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect our emea general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth.

loss on debt extinguishment. we recorded $65.8 million net loss on debt extinguishment during the year ended december 31, 2017 comprised of (i) $14.6 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the early redemption of the senior notes; (ii) $22.5 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the redemption of term loans under the previously outstanding credit facility; (iii) $16.7 million of loss on debt extinguishment as a result of amendments to leases and financing obligations and (iv) $12.0 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the settlement of financing obligations of properties purchased. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded a $12.3 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the settlement of the financing obligations for our paris 3 ibx data center, a portion of the lender fees associated with the japanese yen term loan, and the prepayment and termination of our 2012 and 2013 brazil financings.
income taxes. we operate as a reit for federal income tax purposes. as a reit, we are generally not subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income distributed to stockholders. we intend to distribute or have distributed the entire taxable income generated by the operations of our reit and qrss for the years ended december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, respectively. as such, other than built-in-gains recognized and withholding taxes, no provision for u.s. income taxes for the reit and qrss has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016.
we have made trs elections for some of our subsidiaries in and outside the u.s. in general, a trs may provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for reits to provide and may hold assets that reits cannot hold directly. u.s. income taxes for the trs entities located in the u.s. and foreign income taxes for our foreign operations regardless of whether the foreign operations are operated as qrss or trss have been accrued, as necessary, for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016.
for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded $53.9 million and $45.5 million of income tax expenses, respectively. our effective tax rates were 18.8% and 28.4%, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016. the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily due to recognition of unrecognized tax benefits related to our tax positions in the u.s. and brazil as a result of a lapse in statutes of limitations and lower amount of non-deductible expenses within our emea operations. this is partially offset by net deferred tax asset remeasurement in the u.s. trss due to the corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018 as a result of the tcja.
adjusted ebitda. adjusted ebitda is a key factor in how we assess the operating performance of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as ibx data center expansion decisions. we define adjusted ebitda as income or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs and gain on asset sales. see "non-gaap financial measures" below for more information about adjusted ebitda and a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to income or loss from operations. our adjusted ebitda for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):
years ended december 31,                          % change
americas adjusted ebitda. the increase in our americas adjusted ebitda was primarily due to the verizon data center acquisition, higher revenues as result of our ibx data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. during the year ended december 31, 2017, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.5 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our americas adjusted ebitda primarily due to the u.s. dollar being generally weaker relative to the canadian dollar and brazilian real during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016.
emea adjusted ebitda. the increase in our emea adjusted ebitda was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our ibx data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. during the year ended december 31, 2017, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $2.1 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our emea adjusted ebitda primarily due to a generally weaker u.s. dollar relative to the euro during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016.
asia-pacific adjusted ebitda. the increase in our asia-pacific adjusted ebitda was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our ibx data center expansion activity and organic growth, as described above, and lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues. during the year ended december 31, 2017, the u.s. dollar was generally stronger relative to the japanese yen than during the year ended december 31, 2016, resulting in approximately $2.7 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our asia-pacific revenues during the year ended december 31, 2017 when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended december 31, 2016.
non-gaap financial measures we provide all information required in accordance with gaap, but we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only gaap financial measures. accordingly, we use non-gaap financial measures to evaluate our operations.
non-gaap financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap. non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable gaap financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures. we have presented such non-gaap financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. we believe that the inclusion of these non-gaap financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and ability to perform in subsequent periods. we believe that if we did not provide such non-gaap financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze equinix effectively.
investors should note that the non-gaap financial measures used by us may not be the same non-gaap financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing non-gaap financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-gaap financial measures of other companies.
our primary non-gaap financial measures, adjusted ebitda and adjusted funds from operations ("affo"), exclude depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our ibx data centers and do not reflect our current or future cash spending levels to support our business. our ibx data centers are long-lived assets and have an economic life greater than 10 years. the construction costs of an ibx data center do not recur with respect to such data center, although we may incur initial construction costs in future periods with respect to additional ibx data centers, and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to our initial investment. this is a trend we expect to continue. in addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of our ibx data centers. these estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs incurred to build out our ibx data centers and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. therefore, we exclude depreciation from our operating results when evaluating our operations.
in addition, in presenting adjusted ebitda and affo, we exclude amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions and these charges may vary in amount from period to period. we exclude amortization expense to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our prior periods. we exclude accretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations as well as accrued restructuring charge liabilities, as these expenses represent costs which we believe are not meaningful in evaluating our current operations. we exclude stock-based compensation expense, as it can vary significantly from period to period based on share price, the timing, size and nature of equity awards. as such, we, and many investors and analysts, exclude stock-based compensation expense to compare our operating results with those of other companies. we also exclude restructuring charges. the restructuring charges relate to our decisions to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of our ibx data centers, which we did not intend to build out, or our decision to reverse such restructuring charges. we also exclude impairment charges related to certain long-lived assets. the impairment charges are related to expense recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets are not recoverable. we also exclude gain or loss on asset sales as it represents profit or loss that is not meaningful in evaluating the current or future operating performance. finally, we exclude acquisition costs from affo and adjusted ebitda to allow more comparable comparisons of our financial results to our historical operations. the acquisition costs relate to costs we incur in connection with business combinations. such charges generally are not relevant to assessing the long-term performance of the company. in addition, the frequency and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions. management believes items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, gain or loss on asset sales and acquisition costs are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs may occur in future periods.
adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as income from operations excluding depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs, and gain on asset sales as presented below (in thousands):
acquisition costs                                          34,413                    38,635                    64,195
adjusted ebitda                                        $2,413,240                $2,052,041                $1,657,474
our adjusted ebitda results have improved each year and in each region in total dollars due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in "results of operations", as well as the nature of our business model consisting of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature also discussed earlier in "overview".
funds from operations ("ffo") and affo we use ffo and affo, which are non-gaap financial measures commonly used in the reit industry. ffo is calculated in accordance with the standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts. ffo represents net income (loss), excluding gain (loss) from the disposition of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items.
in presenting affo, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating performance. affo represents ffo excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate assets, accretion, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, a contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and noncontrolling interests' share of these items and net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax. the adjustments for installation revenue, straight-line rent expense and contract costs are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results in the consolidated statement of operations. we exclude the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations. we exclude gain (loss) on debt extinguishment since it generally represents the write-off of initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings or a cost that is incurred to reduce future interest costs and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance. we include an income tax expense adjustment, which represents the non-cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes that do not relate to current period's operations. we deduct recurring capital expenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of its ibx data centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues. we also exclude net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, which represents results that may not recur and are not a good indicator of our current future operating performance.
(gain) loss on disposition of real estate property               4,643                   4,945                 (28,388    )
adjustments for ffo from unconsolidated joint ventures               -                      85                     113
amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums          13,618                    24,449                    18,696
recurring capital expenditures                                                  (203,053    )             (167,995    )             (141,819    )
acquisition costs                                                                 34,413                    38,635                    64,195
adjustments for affo from unconsolidated joint ventures                                -                       (17    )                  (40    )
our affo results have improved due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in "results of operations," as well as due to the nature of our business model which consists of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature as discussed earlier in "overview."
constant currency presentation our revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues and certain operating expenses. as a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the u.s. dollar against major international currencies such as the euro, british pound, japanese yen, singapore dollar, australian dollar and brazilian real. in order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-gaap financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to gaap results of operations. however, we have presented this non-gaap financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results. to present this information, our current and comparative prior period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar are converted into u.s. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended december 31, 2017 are used as exchange rates for the year ended december 31, 2018 when comparing the year
ended december 31, 2018 with the year ended december 31, 2017, and average rates in effect for the year ended december 31, 2016 are used as exchange rates for the year ended december 31, 2017 when comparing the year ended december 31, 2017 with the year ended december 31, 2016).
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2018, our total indebtedness was comprised of debt and financing obligations totaling approximately $11.4 billion consisting of (a) approximately $8,500.1 million of principal from our senior notes, (b) approximately $1,518.9 million from our capital lease and other financing obligations and (c) $1,390.4 million of principal from our loans payable and mortgage (gross of debt issuance cost, debt discount, plus debt premium).
we believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our debt as it becomes due, payment of regular dividend distributions and completion of our publicly-announced expansion projects.
on march 14, 2018, we issued €750.0 million 2.875% euro senior notes due 2024. on april 2, 2018, we completed the infomart dallas acquisition for a purchase price of approximately $804.0 million, which was funded with approximately $45.8 million in cash and $758.2 million aggregate fair value of 5.000% senior unsecured notes. on april 18, 2018, we completed the metronode acquisition for a cash purchase price of a$1.034 billion or approximately $804.6 million at the exchange rate in effect on april 18, 2018. in july, we drew down the full amount of the jpy term loan of ¥47.5 billion, or approximately $424.7 million at the exchange rate effective on july 31, 2018, and prepaid the remaining principal of our existing japanese yen term loan of ¥43.8 billion or approximately $391.3 million. as of december 31, 2018, we had $610.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $280.1 million was held in the u.s. we believe that our current expansion activities in the u.s. can be funded with our u.s.-based cash and cash equivalents and investments. in addition to our cash and investment portfolio, we have additional liquidity available to us from our $2.0 billion revolving facility and the 2018 atm program as described below.
as of december 31, 2018, we had 42 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $68.5 million issued and outstanding under the revolving facility. we had a total of approximately $1.9 billion of additional liquidity available to us under the revolving facility.
for the year ended december 31, 2018, we sold 930,934 shares for approximately $388.2 million, net of payment of commissions to the sales agents and equity offering costs under our 2017 atm program. as of december 31, 2018, no shares remain available for sale under the 2017 atm program. in december 2018, we launched the 2018 atm program to sell up to $750.0 million of common stock in at the market offerings. as of december 31, 2018, no shares have been sold under the 2018 atm program.
besides any further financing activity we may pursue, customer collections are our primary source of cash. while we believe we have a strong customer base, and have continued to experience relatively strong collections, if the current market conditions were to deteriorate, some of our customers may have difficulty paying us and we may experience increased churn in our customer base, including reductions in their commitments to us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. additionally, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build out of new ibx data centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions and joint ventures. while we expect to fund these plans with our existing resources, additional financing, either debt or equity, may be required, and if current market conditions were to deteriorate, we may be unable to secure additional financing, or any such additional financing may only be available to us on unfavorable terms. an inability to pursue additional expansion opportunities will have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our desired level of revenue growth in future periods.
net cash provided by operating activities                $1,815,426                $1,439,233                $1,019,353
net cash used in investing activities                    (3,075,528    )           (5,400,826    )           (2,045,668    )
net cash provided by (used in) financing activities         470,912                 4,607,860                  (897,065    )
operating activities our cash provided by our operations is generated by colocation, interconnection, managed infrastructure and other revenues. our primary use of cash from our operating activities include compensation and related costs, interest payments, other general corporate expenditures and taxes. the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to improved operating results combined with incremental operating cash provided by the acquisitions of infomart dallas and metronode in april 2018 and inclusion of full year operating results of the verizon data center acquisition, offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues, operating expenses, interest expense and income taxes. the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to improved operating results combined with incremental operating cash provided by the verizon data center acquisition and other acquisitions in 2017, offset by timing of collections on our receivables and increases in cash paid for cost of revenues, operating expenses, interest expense and income taxes.
investing activities the decrease in net cash used in investing activities during 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the decrease in spending for business acquisitions of approximately of $3.1 billion, primarily due to the verizon data center acquisition in 2017, partially offset by $717.4 million of higher capital expenditures and $87.3 million of higher purchases of real estate, primarily as a result of expansion activity. the increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the increase in spending for business acquisitions of approximately of $2.2 billion, primarily related to the verizon data center acquisition, a decrease in proceeds from asset sales of $803.8 million, $265.4 million of higher capital expenditures and $67.0 million of higher purchases of real estate, primarily as a result of expansion activity.
during 2019, we anticipate our ibx expansion construction activity will increase from our 2018 levels. if the opportunity to expand is greater than planned and we have sufficient funding to pursue such expansion opportunities, we may further increase the level of capital expenditure to support this growth as well as pursue additional business and real estate acquisitions or joint ventures.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities during 2018 was primarily due to (i) the issuance of €750.0 million 2.875% euro senior notes due 2024, or approximately $929.9 million in u.s. dollars, at the exchange rate in effect on march 14, 2018; (ii) borrowing of the jpy term loan of ¥47.5 billion, or approximately $424.7 million at the exchange rate effective on july 31, 2018; (iii) sale of 930,934 shares under the 2017 atm program, for net proceeds of $388.2 million and (iv) proceeds from employee awards of $50.1 million. the proceeds were partially offset by (i) dividend distributions of $738.6 million; (ii) repayments of capital lease and other financing obligations of $103.8 million; (iii) repayments of mortgage and loans payable of $447.5 million, primarily related to the prepayment of the remaining principal of our existing japanese yen term loan; (iv) payments of debt extinguishment costs of $20.6 million and (v) payments of debt issuance costs of $12.2 million.
net cash provided by financing activities during 2017 was primarily due to (i) borrowings under our previously outstanding credit facility of €1,000.0 million, or approximately $1,059.8 million at the exchange rate in effect on january 6, 2017; (ii) the issuance of $1,250.0 million 2027 senior notes; (iii) the issuance of €1,000.0 million 2025 euro senior notes, or approximately $1,199.7 million at the exchange rate on september 20, 2017; (iv) the issuance of €1,000.0 million 2026 euro senior notes, approximately $1,179.0 million at the exchange rate on december 12, 2017; (v) borrowings under our term loan facility of approximately $997.1 million on december 12, 2017, at the exchange rate in effect on that day; (vi) the sale of common stock for net proceeds of $2,481.4 million and (vii) proceeds from employee awards of $41.7 million, partially offset by (i) repayment of the entire $500.0 million principal amount of our 4.875% senior notes due 2020; (ii) repayment in full of our previously outstanding credit facility of approximately $2,207.7 million in total at the exchange rate on december 12, 2017; (iii) dividend distributions of $621.5 million; (iv) repayments of capital lease and other financing obligations of $93.5 million and (v) debt issuance costs of $81.0 million.
net cash used in financing activities during 2016 was primarily due to (i) $1,462.9 million repayment of loans payable including repayment of loans assumed in the telecitygroup acquisition, bridge term loan and revolving credit facility; (ii) $114.4 million repayment of capital lease and other financing obligations and (iii) $499.5 million payment of dividends, partially offset by $1,168.3 million of proceeds from loans payable including proceeds from our previously outstanding credit facility and japanese yen term loan.
debt obligations debt facilities we have various debt obligations with maturity dates ranging from 2019 to 2027 under which a total principal balance of $9.9 billion remained outstanding as of december 31, 2018. for further information on debt obligations, see "debt facilities" in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
capital lease and other financing obligations we have numerous capital lease and other financing obligations with maturity dates ranging from 2019 to 2053 under which a total principal balance of $1,518.9 million remained outstanding as of december 31, 2018 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 7.88%. for further information on our capital leases and other financing obligations, see "capital lease and other financing obligations" in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
contractual obligations and off-balance-sheet arrangements we lease a majority of our ibx data centers and certain equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements expiring through 2065. the following represents our debt maturities, financings, leases and other contractual commitments as of december 31, 2018 (in thousands):
capital lease and other financing obligations (3)         184,151                 170,592               169,086                 168,810                 164,886           1,601,251             2,458,776
other contractual commitments (5)                       1,129,604                 149,168                36,839                  25,680                  19,789             164,090             1,525,170
(2)   represents interest on mortgage payable, senior notes, term loan facilities and other loans payable based on their approximate interest rates as of december 31, 2018, as well as the credit facility fee for the revolving credit facility.
(5)   represents unaccrued contractual commitments. other contractual commitments are described below.
(6)   represents liability, net of future accretion expense.
in connection with certain of our leases and other contracts requiring deposits, we entered into 42 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $68.5 million under the revolving credit facility. these letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits. if the landlords for these ibx leases decide to draw down on these letters of credit triggered by an event of default under the lease, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowing under the revolving credit facility. these contingent commitments are not reflected in the table above.
we had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling approximately $106.9 million as of december 31, 2018. these liabilities, which are reflected on our balance sheet, are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be paid.
primarily as a result of our various ibx data center expansion projects, as of december 31, 2018, we were contractually committed for $687.6 million of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for ibx equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided in connection with the work necessary to complete construction and open these ibx data centers prior to making them available to customers for installation. this amount, which is expected to be paid during 2019 and thereafter, is reflected in the table above as "other contractual commitments."
we had other non-capital purchase commitments in place as of december 31, 2018, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods, services or arrangements that may contain
embedded leases to be delivered or provided during 2019 and beyond. such other purchase commitments as of december 31, 2018, which total $837.5 million, are also reflected in the table above as "other contractual commitments."
additionally, we entered into lease agreements in various locations for a total lease commitment of approximately $262.2 million, excluding potential lease renewals. these lease agreements will commence between february 2019 and may 2020 with lease terms of 5 to 30 years, which are not reflected in the table above.
other off-balance-sheet arrangements we have various guarantor arrangements with both our directors and officers and third parties, including customers, vendors and business partners. as of december 31, 2018, there were no significant liabilities recorded for these arrangements. for additional information, see "guarantor arrangements" in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. on an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap. management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. however, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain:
•   accounting for income taxes;
•   accounting for business combinations;
•   accounting for impairment of goodwill; and
•   accounting for property, plant and equipment.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              the valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, we had net total deferred tax liabilities of $189.6 million and $186.3 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, we had a total valuation allowance of $57.0 million and $84.6 million, respectively. if and when we reduce our remaining valuation allowances, it may have a favorable impact to our financial position and results of operations in the periods when such determinations are made. we will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances, by country or location, in the future deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or settled. the accounting standard for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined by the accounting standard as a likelihood of more than 50%) that such assets will not be realized.   in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. if, based on the weight of that available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance. the weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified.                                                                                                                                              during the year ended december 31, 2018, we released the full valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets of one of our brazilian legal entities, certain japanese entities and partial valuation allowance against the spanish deferred tax assets acquired from the itconic acquisition as a result of legal entities reorganizations in the americas, apac and emea regions. as part of the purchase accounting determination for the metronode acquisition, we provided full valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets in australia that are not expected to be realizable in the foreseeable future. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we provided full and partial valuation allowances against the spanish and turkish deferred tax assets acquired from the itconic and zenium data center acquisitions, respectively. in addition, we set up a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with excess tax goodwill established as a result of a reorganization in brazil.
a tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authority's widely understood administrative practices and precedents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   this assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a number of types of evidence, including the following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, 2) sources of future taxable income and 3) tax planning strategies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $150.9 million and $82.4 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. during the year ended december 31, 2018, the unrecognized tax benefits increased by $68.5 million primarily due to the metronode acquisition and the reorganization of the spanish entities from the itconic acquisition. during the year ended december 31, 2017, the unrecognized tax benefits increased by $10.2 million primarily due to the telecitygroup integrations which was partially offset by the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits related to the company's tax positions in the u.s. and brazil as a result of a lapse in statutes of limitations. the unrecognized tax benefits of $114.9 million as of december 31, 2018, if subsequently recognized, will affect our effective tax rate favorably at the time when such benefits are recognized.
the tcja included a global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti") provision that increases u.s. federal taxable income by certain foreign subsidiary income in the year it is earned. our accounting policy is to treat any tax on gilti inclusions as a current period cost included in the tax expense in the year incurred. the company believes the gilti inclusion provision will result in no financial statement impact provided the company satisfies its reit distribution requirement with respect to the gilti inclusions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          in assessing the tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position, the tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
our qualification and taxation as a reit depends on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. our ability to satisfy quarterly asset tests depends upon our analysis and the fair market values of our reit and non-reit assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           for purposes of the quarterly reit asset tests, we estimate the fair market value of assets within our qrss and trss using a discounted cash flow approach, by calculating the present value of forecasted future cash flows. we apply discount rates based on industry benchmarks relative to the market and forecasting risks. other key assumptions used to estimate the fair market value of assets in qrss and trss include projected revenue growth, operating margins and forecasted capital expenditure. we revisit key assumptions periodically to reflect any changes due to business or economic environment.

in accordance with the accounting standard for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       as of december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had net intangible assets of $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion and $719.2 million, respectively. we recorded amortization expense for intangible assets of $203.4 million, $177.0 million and $122.9 million for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
we use all available information to estimate fair values. we typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as customer contracts, leases and any other significant assets or liabilities and contingent consideration, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. we adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we used to complete the purchase price allocations and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, which would be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in 2019 or beyond.

in accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform goodwill and other intangible assets impairment reviews annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. we complete the annual goodwill impairment assessment for the americas, emea and asia-pacific reporting units to determine if the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values. we perform a review of other intangible assets for impairment by assessing events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.   we performed our annual review of other intangible assets by assessing if there were events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset or a continuous deterioration of our financial condition. this assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. there were no specific events in 2018 or 2017 that indicated a potential impairment.   future events, changing market conditions and any changes in key assumptions may result in an impairment charge. while we have not recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the development of adverse business conditions in our americas, emea or asia-pacific reporting units, such as higher than anticipated customer churn or significantly increased operating costs, or significant deterioration of our market comparables that we use in the market approach, could result in an impairment charge in future periods.
the balance of our other intangible assets, net, for the year ended december 31, 2018 was $2.3 billion. while we have not recorded an impairment charge against our other intangible assets to date, future events or changes in circumstances, such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate, may result in an impairment charge in future periods.
any potential impairment charge against our goodwill and other intangible assets would not exceed the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.

we have a substantial amount of property, plant and equipment recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. the vast majority of our property, plant and equipment represent the costs incurred to build out or acquire our ibx data centers. our ibx data centers are long-lived assets. we depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (subject to the term of the lease in the case of leased assets or leasehold improvements and integral equipment located in leased properties).                                                                                              another area of judgment for us in connection with our property, plant and equipment is related to lease accounting. some of our ibx data centers are leased. each time we enter into a new lease or lease amendment for one of our ibx data centers, we analyze each lease or lease amendment for the proper accounting. this requires certain judgments such as establishing the lease term to include in a lease test, establishing the remaining estimated useful life of the underlying property or equipment and estimating the fair value of the underlying property or equipment, establishing the incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payment for the lease test. all of these judgments are inherently uncertain. different assumptions or estimates could result in a different accounting treatment for a lease.                                                                                     as of december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had property, plant and equipment under capital leases of $823.6 million, $760.4 million and $715.3 million, respectively. we recorded accumulated depreciation for assets under capital leases of $248.9 million, $199.2 million and $161.4 million as of december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
accounting for property, plant and equipment includes determining the appropriate period in which to depreciate such assets, making assessments for leased properties to determine whether they are capital or operating leases, determining if construction projects performed at leased properties trigger build-to-suit lease accounting, assessing such assets for potential impairment, capitalizing interest during periods of construction and assessing the asset retirement obligations required for certain leased properties that require us to return the leased properties back to their original condition at the time we decide to exit a leased property.   the assessment of long-lived assets for impairment requires assumptions and estimates of undiscounted and discounted future cash flows. these assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and are inherently uncertain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          additionally, during the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded rent expense of approximately $185.4 million, $157.9 million and $140.6 million respectively.

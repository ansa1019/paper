net debt-to-total invested capital             n/a                     n/a cash and cash equivalents include all instruments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased. working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents, and total invested capital is defined as the sum of net debt and total equity. net debt and total invested capital are non-u.s. gaap financial measures that should not be used as a substitute for the comparable u.s. gaap financial measures. the non-u.s. gaap financial measures are incorporated into our discussion and analysis as management believes that this information provides users with a valuable insight into our overall performance and financial position.
cash and cash equivalents - our cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31, 2018 consisted of cash held in depository accounts with banks around the world and cash invested in high-quality, short-term investments. the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31, 2018 included $174.6 million of cash held by subsidiaries within the u.s., and $162.8 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the u.s. in response to the 2017 tax act, we reevaluated our position regarding permanent reinvestment of foreign subsidiary earnings and profits through 2017 (with the exception of china and mexico) and decided that those profits were no longer permanently reinvested. as of january 1, 2018, we reasserted indefinite reinvestment related to all post-2017 unremitted earnings in all of our foreign subsidiaries. in general, it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and repatriate earnings only when the tax impact is de minimis, and that position has not changed subsequent to the one-time transition tax under the 2017 tax act, except as noted above. accordingly, no deferred taxes have been provided for withholding taxes or other taxes that would result upon repatriation of approximately $79.7 million of undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries to the u.s., as those earnings continue to be permanently reinvested. further, it is impracticable for us to estimate any future tax costs for any unrecognized deferred tax liabilities associated with our indefinite reinvestment assertion, because the actual tax liability, if any, would be dependent on complex analysis and calculations considering various tax laws, exchange rates, circumstances existing when there is a repatriation, sale, or liquidation, or other factors.
working capital - working capital at december 31, 2018 increased by $146.7 million, or 31.6%, as compared to december 31, 2017, including a decrease of $16.5 million due to foreign currency translation. excluding the impact of currency exchange rates, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventories, and total current liabilities increased by $107.1 million, $43.8 million, $7.0 million, and $11.3 million, respectively. the increase in accounts receivable was due to increased sales activity, longer customer payment terms, and our adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance. the increase in current liabilities was due to an increase in accrued salaries, wages and benefits.
debt and credit facilities - the $0.9 million decrease in total debt at december 31, 2018, as compared to december 31, 2017, primarily resulted from foreign currency rate fluctuations.
our sources of liquidity include our credit facility. at december 31, 2018, we had $28.6 million in outstanding long-term borrowings under this facility, of which $4.6 million was denominated in yen and $24.0 million was denominated in euro. these borrowings, together with outstanding letters of credit of $2.5 million, resulted in a borrowing capacity available under our credit facility of $268.9 million at december 31, 2018. we do not expect
any significant limitations on our ability to access this source of funds. please refer to note 9, debt, for further discussion of our credit facility.
pursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements, we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios. in addition, the agreements contain other customary covenants, none of which we consider restrictive to our operations. at december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants, and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements throughout 2019.
we believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations, together with availability under our credit facility, will be adequate to address our foreseeable liquidity needs based on our current expectations of our business operations, capital expenditures and scheduled payments of debt obligations.
commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our commitments and contractual obligations at december 31, 2018. these obligations are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity.
debt (excluding unamortized debt issuance costs)       196.7                 0.1                28.6              42.0                 126.0
other long-term liabilities (3)                          3.3                 0.4                 0.8               0.9                   1.2
(1)   our business creates a need to enter into various commitments with suppliers. in accordance with u.s. gaap, these purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. these purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business.
(2)   for fixed-rate long-term debt, interest was based on principal amounts and fixed coupon rates at year-end. future interest payments on variable-rate debt were calculated using principal amounts and the applicable ending interest rate at year-end. interest on fixed-rate derivative instruments was based on notional amounts and fixed interest rates contractually obligated at year-end.
(3)   represents acquisition-related contingencies. in connection with certain business acquisitions, we agreed to make payments to the sellers if and when certain operating milestones are achieved, such as sales and operating income targets.
(4)   this table does not include obligations pertaining to pension and postretirement benefits because the actual amount and timing of future contributions may vary significantly depending upon plan asset performance, benefit payments, and other factors. contributions to our plans are expected to be $3.9 million in 2019. please refer to note 14, benefit plans, for estimated benefit payments over the next ten years.
reserves for uncertain tax positions - the table above does not include $3.9 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31, 2018. due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for amounts which may be paid.
letters of credit - we have letters of credit totaling $2.5 million supporting the reimbursement of workers' compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers. our accrual for insurance obligations was
$3.4 million at december 31, 2018, of which $0.9 million is in excess of our deductible and, therefore, is reimbursable by the insurance company.
off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases, unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business, and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions, some of which are subjective and complex, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position:
revenue recognition: our revenue results from the sale of goods or services and reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. we record revenue based on a five-step model, in accordance with accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 606 ("asc 606"). following the identification of a contract with a customer, we identify the performance obligations (goods or services) in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and recognize the revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services to our customers. a good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service.
we recognize the majority of our revenue, primarily relating to proprietary products product sales, at a point in time, following the transfer of control of our products to our customers, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery, depending on the terms of the related agreements.
we recognize revenue relating to our contract-manufactured products product sales and certain proprietary products product sales over time, as our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to us and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
we recognize revenue relating to our development and tooling agreements over time, as our performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced.
for revenue recognized over time, revenue is recognized by applying a method of measuring progress toward complete satisfaction of the related performance obligation. when selecting the method for measuring progress, we select the method that best depicts the transfer of control of goods or services promised to our customers.
revenue for our contract-manufactured products product sales, certain proprietary products product sales, and our development and tooling agreements is recorded under an input method, which recognizes revenue on the basis of our efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation (for example, resources consumed, labor hours expended, costs incurred, time elapsed, or machine hours used) relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation. the input method that we use is based on costs incurred.
the majority of the performance obligations within our contracts are satisfied within one year or less. performance obligations satisfied beyond one year include those relating to a nonrefundable customer payment of $20.0 million received in june 2013 in return for the exclusive use of the smartdose® technology platform within a specific therapeutic area. as of december 31, 2018, there was $6.5 million of unearned income related to this payment, of which $0.9 million was included in other current liabilities and $5.6 million was included in other long-term liabilities. the unearned income is being recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the agreement. the agreement does not include a future minimum purchase commitment from the customer.
our revenue can be generated from contracts with multiple performance obligations. when a sales agreement involves multiple performance obligations, each obligation is separately identified and the transaction price is allocated based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised good or service to the customer.
some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes. we record rebate costs when sales occur based on our assessment of the likelihood that the required volumes will be attained. we also maintain an allowance for product returns, as we believe that we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of returns based on our substantial historical experience.
contract assets or liabilities result from transactions with revenue recorded over time. if the measure of remaining rights exceeds the measure of the remaining performance obligations, we record a contract asset. contract assets are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in accounts receivable, net, and other assets (current and noncurrent portions, respectively). contract assets included in accounts receivable, net, relate to the unbilled amounts of our product sales for which we have recognized revenue over time. contract assets included in other assets represent the remaining performance obligations of our development and tooling agreements. conversely, if the measure of the remaining performance obligations exceeds the measure of the remaining rights, we record a contract liability. contract liabilities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in other liabilities (current and noncurrent portions, respectively) and represent cash payments received in advance of our performance.
impairment of long-lived assets: long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, are tested for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. an asset is considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset. once an asset is considered impaired, an impairment loss is recorded within other (income) expense for the difference between the asset's carrying value and its fair value. for assets held and used in the business, management determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset, discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate. for assets held for sale or for investment purposes, management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset, less disposition costs. during 2018, as part of our 2018 restructuring plan, we recorded within other expense a $2.2 million non-cash asset write-down associated with the discontinued use of certain equipment. during 2016, as part of our 2016 restructuring plan, we recorded within other expense a $4.5 million non-cash asset write-down associated with the discontinued use of certain equipment.
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets: goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually, following the completion of our annual budget and long-range planning process, or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the same as, or one level below, our operating segments. in january 2017, the fasb issued guidance which removes the second step of the goodwill impairment test. a goodwill impairment charge will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. this guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2019. early adoption is permitted. we adopted this guidance as of january 1, 2017, on a prospective basis. considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test, such as future sales, future cash flows and long-term growth rates, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test are also largely dependent on the continued sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products, as well as our timeliness and success in new-product innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multi-component systems. changes in the estimate of fair value, including the estimate of future cash flows, could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position. recent accounting guidance also allows entities to first assess qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and overall financial performance, to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. as each of our reporting units had a fair value in excess of its carrying value of at least 180% within our 2016 annual impairment test, we elected to follow this guidance for our 2017 and 2018 annual impairment tests. based upon our assessment, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting
units was less than its carrying amount and determined that it was not necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment tests in 2017 and 2018.
at december 31, 2015, a trademark had been determined to have an indefinite life and, therefore, was not subject to amortization. during 2016, as part of our 2016 restructuring plan, we recorded within other expense a $10.0 million non-cash asset write-down associated with the discontinued use of this trademark.
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. during 2016, as part of our 2016 restructuring plan, we recorded within other expense a $2.8 million non-cash asset write-down associated with the discontinued use of a patent.
employee benefits: we maintain funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the u.s. and a number of other countries that cover employees who meet eligibility requirements. in addition, we sponsor postretirement benefit plans which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or become disabled. the measurement of annual cost and obligations under these defined benefit postretirement plans is subject to a number of assumptions, which are specific for each of our u.s. and foreign plans. the assumptions, which are reviewed at least annually, are relevant to both the plan assets (where applicable) and the obligation for benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees. two of the most critical assumptions in determining pension and retiree medical plan expense are the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement age, rates of compensation increases, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. for our funded plans, we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our plan assets, as well as historical and expected rates of return, in estimating the long-term rate of return on plan assets. under u.s. gaap, differences between actual and expected results are generally accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) as actuarial gains or losses and subsequently amortized into earnings over future periods.
changes in key assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position. we estimate that every 25-basis point reduction in our long-term rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by $0.5 million, and every 25-basis point reduction in our discount rate would increase pension expense by $0.5 million. a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations. our net pension underfunded balance at december 31, 2018 was $52.5 million, compared to $48.5 million at december 31, 2017. our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was $6.0 million at december 31, 2018, compared to $7.1 million at december 31, 2017.
income taxes: we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation. in addition, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities. we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. the recoverability of tax assets is subject to our estimates of future profitability, generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level. changes in tax legislation, business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments, which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined.
when accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements, we apply a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.

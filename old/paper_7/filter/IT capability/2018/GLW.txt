item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations organization of information management's discussion and analysis provides a historical and prospective narrative on the company's financial condition and results of operations.  this discussion includes the following sections:
·   overview
·   core performance measures
·   liquidity and capital resources
·   environment
·   critical accounting estimates
·   forward-looking statements
overview strategy and capital allocation framework in october 2015, corning announced a strategy and capital allocation framework (the "framework") that reflects the company's financial and operational strengths, as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value.  the framework outlines our leadership priorities, and articulates the opportunities we see across our businesses.  we designed the framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength.  under the framework we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth.
our probability of success increases as we invest in our world-class capabilities.  corning is concentrating approximately 80% of its research, development and engineering investment and capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market-access platforms.  this strategy will allow us to quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets as needed.
performance against the framework since introducing the framework, we have distributed $11.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and increased the annual dividend by 11.1% in 2019, 16.1% in 2018, 14.8% in 2017 and 12.5% in 2016 as part of our ongoing commitment to return cash to our investors.
highlights of progress in corning's market-access platforms include:
·   securing contracts with industry leaders in the carrier and data center segments that will add significant sales in 2019 and beyond, and completing the acquisition of cmd in optical communications;
·   extending the company's leadership in mobile consumer electronics with the launch and adoption of gorilla glass 6 as well as other cover glass and sensing technology innovations;
·   gaining significant new sales and platforms for gasoline particulate filters and strong pull for gorilla glass for automotive solutions, particularly the industry's first autograde glass solutions for automotive interiors, reaching more than 55 platforms to date;
·   reaching stable returns in display technologies as the glass pricing environment continued to improve and corning extended global leadership by successfully ramping the world's first gen 10.5 lcd glass plant.
for the year ended december 31, 2018, we generated net income of $1.1 billion, or $1.13 per share, compared to a net loss of $0.5 billion, or $(0.66) per share, for 2017.  when compared to 2017, the $1.6 billion increase in net income was primarily due to the following items (amounts presented after tax):
·   the absence of $1.5 billion in tax reform adjustments related to the 2017 tax act;
·   higher segment net income in our optical communications, environmental technologies, specialty materials and life sciences segments, up $123 million, $43 million, $12 million and $22 million, respectively; and
·   the positive impact of $48 million in tax adjustments, primarily related to changes in the valuation allowances on deferred tax assets offset by the preliminary 2013-2014 irs audit settlement.
partially offsetting these events were the following items:
·   an increase of $105 million in legal expenses, driven by a ruling in an intellectual property lawsuit and developments in civil litigation matters;
·   an impact of $99 million resulting from an increase of mark-to-market loss for our defined benefit pension plans; and
·   lower segment net income in our display technologies and all other segments in the amount of $53 million and $22 million, respectively.
diluted earnings per share increased by $1.79 per share, or 271%, when compared to 2017, driven by the increase in net income described above, coupled with the repurchase of 74.8 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in 2018, did not materially impact corning's consolidated net income in the year ended december 31, 2018 when compared to the year ended december 31, 2017.
2019 corporate outlook we believe 2019 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our strategy and capital allocation framework.  in our display technologies segment, we expect full year 2019 price declines to improve further to a mid-single digit percentage.  we anticipate corning's display glass volume will grow faster than the expected display glass market growth of mid-single digits, driven by television screen size growth and the ramp of our gen 10.5 facility in china.  in the optical communications segment, we expect sales to increase by low-teens in percentage terms, including the impact of a full year of sales from the acquisition of 3m's communication markets division.  we expect high-single digit sales growth in our environmental technologies segment.  we expect growth in the specialty materials segment, the rate of which will depend on the adoption of our innovations.  we anticipate low to mid-single digit percentage growth in sales for the life sciences segment.  © 2019 corning incorporated. all rights reserved.

index for the year ended december 31, 2018, segment net sales increased by $1.1 billion, or 11%, when compared to the same period in 2017.  the primary sales drivers by segment were as follows:
·   display technologies segment net sales increased $139 million compared to the prior year. total display glass market volume was up in 2018. our volume growth in this market more than offset price declines on a year-over-year basis. 2018 was the best pricing environment in more than a decade, achieving the important milestone of mid-single digit year-over-year declines during the second half of the year;
·   an increase of $647 million in the optical communications segment, due to higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products, up $364 million and $283 million, respectively. the acquisition of cmd driving $200 million of the increase in sales;
·   an increase of $183 million in the environmental technologies segment, driven by sales growth in all categories including sales of gas particulate filters; and
·   an increase of $67 million in the life sciences segment, as the business continued to outpace the market.
movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact corning's consolidated net sales in the year ended december 31, 2018, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2017.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, net sales increased by $818 million, or 9%, when compared to the same period in 2016.  the primary sales drivers by segment were as follows:
·   a decrease of $151 million in the display technologies segment, driven by price declines of approximately 10%, partially offset by an increase in volume in the mid-single digits in percentage terms;
·   an increase of $540 million in the optical communications segment, due to higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products, up $446 million and $94 million, respectively, combined with the absence of production issues related to the implementation of new manufacturing software in the first quarter of 2016. strong growth in the north american market drove the increase in carrier network products;
·   an increase of $279 million in the specialty materials segment, driven by strong growth in segment net sales of corning gorilla glass products, combined with an increase of $42 million in advanced optics products;
·   an increase of $74 million in the environmental technologies segment, driven by higher net sales of automotive products, up $42 million, due to market strength in europe, china and asia, and initial commercial sales of gas particulate filters. diesel product sales increased $32 million with higher demand for heavy-duty diesel products in north america and asia;
·   an increase of $36 million in the all other segment, driven by an increase in sales in our emerging businesses.
movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact corning's consolidated net sales in the year ended december 31, 2017, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2016.
in 2018, 2017 and 2016, sales in international markets accounted for 69%, 69% and 72%, respectively, of total net sales.
cost of sales the types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production-related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter-location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; and other production overhead.
index gross margin in the year ended december 31, 2018, gross margin dollars increased by $441 million, or 11%, and gross margin as a percentage of net sales was consistent when compared to the same period last year.  the increase in gross margin dollars was primarily driven by the following items:
·   higher sales in the optical communications segment, driven by growth in carrier and enterprise products, resulting in increased gross margin of $291 million;
·   higher sales in the environmental technologies segment drove an $85 million increase.
gross margin increases were partially offset by higher costs related to capacity expansions across multiple business segments and display glass price declines.
movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact corning's consolidated gross margin in the year ended december 31, 2018, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2017.
in the year ended december 31, 2017, gross margin dollars increased by $257 million, or 7%, and gross margin as a percentage of net sales remained consistent at 40%, when compared to the same period last year.  the increase in gross margin dollars was primarily driven by the following items:
·   higher volume in the display technologies segment, offset by higher costs related to capacity expansion;
·   higher volume in the optical communications segment, driven by growth in north america and europe, partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses related to capacity expansion;
·   an increase in gorilla glass and advanced optics product volume, slightly offset by higher raw materials costs; and
·   higher light-duty substrate demand in europe, china and asia, offset somewhat by lower north america demand, as well as an increase in demand for heavy-duty diesel products in north america and asia. partially offsetting the increase in demand was a decline in manufacturing efficiency due to the use of higher-cost manufacturing facilities and sales of lower margin products.
display glass price declines of approximately 10% and the negative impact of movements in the japanese yen and south korean won in the amount of $73 million, which primarily impacted the display technologies segment, partially offset the increase.
movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact corning's consolidated net sales in the year ended december 31, 2017, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2016.
selling, general and administrative expenses when compared to the year ended december 31, 2017, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $326 million, or 22%, in the year ended december 31, 2018.  selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 1% as a percentage of sales.  the increase was primarily driven by the following items:
·   an increase of $137 million in litigation and other legal expenses, driven by a ruling in an intellectual property lawsuit and developments in commercial litigation matters;
·   an increase in the optical communications segment, up $65 million, largely driven by the acquisition of cmd;
·   increased acquisition related costs of $25 million; and
·   increased costs in our emerging businesses, up $20 million, driven by investments in new customers and new business growth.
index when compared to the year ended december 31, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $11 million in the year ended december 31, 2017.  the increase was due to the following items:
·   a decrease of $52 million in acquisition-related costs, driven by the absence of costs related to the realignment of our equity interests in dow corning completed in the second quarter of 2016, offset slightly by several small acquisitions occurring in 2017;
·   a decrease of $64 million in litigation, regulatory and other legal costs, primarily driven by the absence of events occurring in the second quarter of 2016. in this period, we recorded litigation and other expenses related to the resolution of an investigation by the u.s. department of justice and an environmental matter in the amount of $98 million, offset somewhat by the gain on the contribution of our equity interests in pcc and pce as partial settlement of the asbestos litigation in the amount of $56 million; and
·   a decrease of $46 million in the mark-to-market of our defined benefit pension plans.
offsetting these events were the following items:
·   a decrease of $32 million in gains from the contingent consideration fair value adjustment;
·   an increase of $51 million in the optical communications segment due to costs associated with acquisitions and growth initiatives; and
·   an increase of $24 million in the specialty materials segment in support of new product launches.
the types of expenses included in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item are: salaries, wages and benefits; travel; professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities, and rent for administrative facilities.
research, development and engineering expenses for year ended december 31, 2018, research, development and engineering expenses increased by $129 million, or 15%, when compared to 2017, driven by higher costs associated with new product launches and our emerging businesses.  as a percentage of sales, these expenses were flat when compared to the same period last year.
in the year ended december 31, 2017, research, development and engineering expenses increased by $128 million, or 17%, when compared to the same period last year, driven by the absence of the impact of a 2016 joint development agreement in the display technologies segment, as well as higher costs associated with new product launches in the optical communications, specialty materials and environmental technologies segments, up $20 million, $11 million and $7 million, respectively.  as a percentage of sales, these expenses decreased one percent when compared to the same period last year.
equity in earnings of affiliated companies the following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies (in millions):
total equity earnings                  $390              $361               $284
(1)   results include equity earnings for dow corning, which includes the silicones business and hemlock semiconductor business, through may 31, 2016, the date of the realignment of our ownership interest in dow corning.
(2)   results include equity earnings for hsg beginning on june 1, 2016.
index on may 31, 2016, corning completed the strategic realignment of its equity investment in dow corning corporation ("dow corning") pursuant to the transaction agreement announced on december 10, 2015.  under the terms of the transaction agreement, corning exchanged with dow corning its 50% stock interest in dow corning for 100% of the stock of a newly formed entity, which held an equity interest in hemlock semiconductor group (hsg) and approximately $4.8 billion in cash.
the equity in earnings line on our income statement for the year ended december 31, 2016 reflects both the equity earnings from the silicones and polysilicones (hsg) businesses of dow corning from january 1, 2016 through may 31, 2016.  prior to the realignment of dow corning, equity earnings from the hsg business were reported on the equity in earnings line in corning's income statement, net of dow corning's 35% u.s. tax.  additionally, corning reported its tax on equity earnings from dow corning on the tax provision line on its income statement at a u.s. tax provision rate of 7%.  as part of the realignment, hsg was converted to a partnership.  each of the partners is responsible for the taxes on their portion of equity earnings.  therefore, post-realignment, hsg's equity earnings is reported before tax on the equity in earnings line and corning's tax is reported on the tax provision line.

index the gross notional value outstanding for our translated earnings contracts at december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in billions):
british pound-denominated hedges               0.1
total gross notional value outstanding       $13.6             $14.3             $16.7
income before income taxes the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in 2018, did not impact corning's income before income taxes in the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, when compared to the same period in the prior year.
(provision) benefit for income taxes our (provision) benefit for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows (dollars in millions):
(provision) benefit for income taxes   $(437)              $(2,154)                        $3
effective tax rate (benefit)                 29.1%                130.0%               (0.1)%
for the year ended december 31, 2018, the effective income tax rate differed from the u.s. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the following:
·   additional taxes of $55 million related primarily to the global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti") provisions of the 2017 tax act; and
·   incremental tax expense of $172 million related to a preliminary agreement with the irs for the income tax audit of years 2013 and 2014.
these items were partially offset by the following:
·   a benefit of $35 million related to the finalization of the one-time toll charge recorded in 2017; and
·   an $82 million benefit from the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are now considered realizable.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, the effective income tax rate differed from the u.s. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following:
·   as a result of the 2017 tax act, a provisional tax expense of $1.1 billion for the one-time toll charge on unrepatriated earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred;
·   the result of a provisional tax expense of $347 million recorded for the u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities re-measured at the reduced rate of 21%; and
·   rate differences on income (loss) of consolidated foreign companies.
index the effective income tax rate for 2016 differed from the u.s. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items:
·   rate differences on income (loss) of consolidated foreign companies, including the benefit of excess foreign tax credits resulting from the inclusion of foreign earnings in u.s. income; and
·   the tax-free nature of the realignment of our equity interest in dow corning during the period, as well as the release of the deferred tax liability related to corning's tax on dow corning's undistributed earnings as of the date of the transaction.
in december 2017, the u.s. enacted the 2017 tax act which resulted in significant changes for our financial results, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, and (2) imposing a one-time toll charge tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries of u.s. companies that had not been previously taxed in the u.s.
given the significant complexity of the 2017 tax act and the lack of clear tax and accounting regulatory guidance for this new law, the securities exchange commission issued its staff accounting bulletin 118 ("sab 118") to provide registrants additional time to analyze and report the effects of tax reform during the "measurement period".  under sab 118, the registrant was required to record those items where asc 740 analysis was complete; include reasonable estimates and label them as provisional where asc 740 analysis was incomplete; and if reasonable estimates could not be made, record items under the previous tax law.  the measurement period, not to exceed one year, ended on the date the entity had obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information that was needed to complete the accounting requirements under asc topic 740.
the 2017 tax act also established new tax provisions affecting our 2018 results, including, but not limited to: (1) creating a new provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (gilti); (2) generally eliminating u.s. federal taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (3) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax ("amt"); (4) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax ("beat"); (5) establishing a deduction for foreign derived intangible income ("fdii"); (6) establishing new limitations on deductible interest expense; and (7) establishing new limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation.
for the year ended december 31, 2018, corning's results included a worldwide tax provision of $437 million, inclusive of tax on ongoing operations of $412 million and the impacts of the 2017 tax act of $25 million.  the impacts of the 2017 tax act include: gilti tax of $55 million, fdii benefit of $10 million, and a $20 million benefit related to truing up the toll charge and our measurement of u.s. deferred taxes, offset by the recording of a provision related to lifting our assertion of indefinite reinvestment on certain foreign earnings.  as of december 31, 2018, corning has completed its analysis of the impact of the 2017 tax act as required by sab 118.  the gilti tax of $55 million was largely driven by the receipt of customer deposits.  see note 2 (revenue) to these consolidated financial statements for more information.
corning has completed its analysis on the impact of the 2017 tax act on its assertion regarding its indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings.  corning has determined that it will no longer assert indefinite asset reinvestment on $15.4 billion of unremitted foreign earnings accumulated prior to 2018.  this represents approximately 94% of corning's unremitted foreign earnings as of the end of 2017.  corning will continue to indefinitely reinvest the remaining 6% of historic foreign earnings as of december 31, 2017.
beginning in 2018, corning will indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings of: (1) any of its subsidiaries located in jurisdictions where corning lacks the ability to repatriate its earnings, (2) any of its subsidiaries where corning's intention is to reinvest those earnings in operations, (3) legal entities for which corning holds a non-controlling interest, (4) any subsidiaries with an accumulated deficit in earnings and profits and (5) any subsidiaries which have a positive earnings and profits balance but for which the entity lacks sufficient local statutory earnings or stock basis from which to make a distribution.
index during 2018, the company distributed approximately $4.2 billion from foreign subsidiaries to their respective u.s. parent companies.  there are no incremental taxes beyond the toll charge due with respect to these distributions.  as of december 31, 2018, corning has approximately $1.5 billion of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings.  it remains impracticable to calculate the tax cost of repatriating our unremitted earnings which are considered indefinitely reinvested.
refer to note 4 (income taxes) to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding income tax matters.
net income (loss) attributable to corning incorporated as a result of the items discussed above, net income (loss) and per share data was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

for the year ended december 31, 2018, comprehensive income increased by $0.6 billion, when compared to the same period in 2017, driven by an increase in net income of $1.6 billion largely driven by the absence of $1.5 billion in tax reform adjustments related to the 2017 tax act.
index partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in the gain on foreign currency translation adjustments in the amount of $0.9 billion (after-tax), largely driven by the strengthening of foreign currencies, most significantly the south korean won, euro and the chinese yuan, which impacted comprehensive income in the amounts of $556 million, $156 million and $114 million, respectively.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, comprehensive income decreased by $3.5 billion, when compared to the same period in 2016, driven by a decrease in net income of $4.2 billion and a decrease in unamortized actuarial gains for postretirement benefit plans.  the significant decrease in net income was largely driven by the absence of a $2.7 billion non-taxable gain and a $105 million positive tax adjustment on the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in dow corning recorded in the second quarter of 2016, combined with the impact of the passage of the 2017 tax act, which included a provisional toll charge of $1.1 billion and a provisional charge of $347 million as a result of the remeasurement of u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities.  our unamortized actuarial gains decreased driven by a decrease in the discount rates used to value our postretirement benefit obligations.
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in the gain on foreign currency translation adjustments in the amount of $850 million (after-tax), largely driven by the weakening of foreign currencies, most significantly the south korean won, japanese yen and the euro, which impacted comprehensive income in the amounts of $420 million, $164 million and $115 million, respectively.

core performance measures in managing the company and assessing our financial performance, we adjust certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to arrive at core performance measures.  these items include gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation-related expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the company or our equity affiliates.  additionally, corning has adopted the use of constant currency reporting for our display technologies and specialty materials segments for the japanese yen, south korean won, chinese yuan and new taiwan dollar currencies.  the company believes that the use of constant currency reporting allows investors to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations, and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows.  corning also believes that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions.
core performance measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap").  we believe investors should consider these non-gaap measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends.  these measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for, gaap reporting measures.  with respect to the company's outlook for future periods, it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these non-gaap measures because the company does not forecast the movement of the japanese yen, south korean won, chinese yuan or new taiwan dollar against the u.s. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the company's control.  as a result, the company is unable to provide outlook information on a gaap basis.

in the year ended december 31, 2018, we generated core earnings of $1,673 million or $1.78 per share, compared to core earnings generated in the year ended december 31, 2017 of $1,634 million, or $1.60 per share.  the increase in core earnings of $39 million was driven by the following items:
·   an increase in the optical communications segment of $123 million, driven by higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products;
·   an increase in the environmental technologies segment of $43 million resulting from sales growth across all product lines;
·   an increase of $22 million in the life sciences segment resulting from higher sales, as well as improved manufacturing efficiencies; and
·   a decrease in the display technologies segment of $53 million, with the costs of expanding gen 10.5 capacity, ramping production and rebuilding tanks for fleet optimization during the first half of the year more than offsetting increased sales;
·   a decrease of $22 million in the all other segment resulting from increased investment in development projects;
in the year ended december 31, 2017, we generated core earnings of $1,634 million or $1.60 per share, compared to core earnings generated in the year ended december 31, 2016 of $1,651million, or $1.44 per share.  the decrease in core earnings of $17 million was driven by the following items:
·   the absence of equity earnings of $98 million from dow corning's silicones business due to our 2016 realignment of our ownership interest in dow corning;
·   a decrease of $65 million in the display technologies segment, driven by display glass price declines of approximately 10%, partially offset by an increase in volume in the mid-single digits in percentage terms; and
the decline was offset by an increase in core earnings in the optical communications segment of $118 million, due to higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products, combined with the absence of the production issues in the first half of 2016 related to the implementation of new software and an increase in the specialty materials segment of $73 million, driven by an increase in corning gorilla glass and advanced optics products.
included in core earnings for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 is net periodic pension expense in the amount of $52 million, $49 million and $51 million, respectively, which excludes the annual pension mark-to-market adjustments.  in the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the mark-to-market adjustments pre-tax losses of $145 million, $21 million and $67 million, respectively.

reconciliation of non-gaap measures we utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with gaap to assess our financial and operating performance.  a non-gaap financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income or statement of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income or statement of cash flows.
core net sales, core equity in earnings of affiliated companies and core earnings are non-gaap financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the company's operations.

(a)based upon statutory tax rates in the specific jurisdiction for each event.
see "items excluded from gaap measures" below for the descriptions of the footnoted reconciling items.
index items which we exclude from gaap measures to arrive at core performance measures are as follows:
(1)   constant-currency adjustments: because a significant portion of display technologies segment revenues are denominated in japanese yen, and a significant portion of display technologies and specialty materials segment manufacturing costs are denominated in japanese yen, korean won, new taiwan dollar and chinese yuan, management believes it is important to understand the impact on earnings of translating these currencies into u.s. dollars. presenting results on a constant-currency basis mitigates the translation impact and allows management to evaluate performance period over period, analyze underlying trends in our businesses, and establish operational goals and forecasts.
constant-yen: as of january 1, 2018, we use an internally derived management rate of ¥107, which is closely aligned to our current yen portfolio of foreign currency hedges, and have recast all periods presented based on this rate to effectively remove the impact of changes in the japanese yen.
constant-won: as of january 1, 2018, we use an internally derived management rate of ₩1,175, which is closely aligned to our current won portfolio of foreign currency hedges, and have recast all periods presented based on this rate.
constant-yuan: in january 2018, we began presenting results of the display technologies and specialty materials segments on a constant-yuan basis to mitigate the translation impact of this currency on these segments. we use an internally derived management rate of yuan 6.7, which is closely aligned to our current yuan portfolio of foreign currency hedges and consistent with historical prior period averages.
constant-taiwan dollar: in january 2018, we began presenting results of the display technologies and specialty materials segments on a constant-taiwan dollar basis to mitigate the translation impact of this currency on these segments. we use an internally derived management rate of new taiwan dollar 31, which is closely aligned to our current new taiwan dollar portfolio of cash flow hedges, and approximates the 10-year historical average of the currency.
(3)   translated earnings contract (gain) loss: we have excluded the impact of the realized and unrealized gains and losses of our japanese yen, south korean won, chinese yuan and new taiwan dollar-denominated foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings, as well as the unrealized gains and losses of our euro and british pound-denominated foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings.
(4)   acquisition-related costs: these expenses include intangible amortization, inventory valuation adjustments and external acquisition-related deal costs.
(5)   discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments: for 2018, this amount primarily relates to the preliminary irs audit settlement offset by changes in judgment about the realizability of certain deferred tax assets. for 2017, this amount represents the removal of discrete adjustments (e.g., changes in tax law, other than those of the 2017 tax act which are set forth separately, and changes in judgment about the realizability of certain deferred tax assets) as well as other non-operational tax-related adjustments.
(6)   litigation, regulatory and other legal matters: includes amounts that reflect developments in commercial litigation, intellectual property disputes and other legal matters.
(7)   restructuring, impairment and other charges: this amount includes restructuring, impairment and other charges, as well as other expenses which are not related to continuing operations and are not classified as restructuring expense.
(8)   equity in earnings of affiliated companies: these adjustments relate to costs not related to continuing operations of our affiliated companies, such as restructuring, impairment and other charges and settlements, or modifications, under "take-or-pay" contracts.
(9)   adjustments related to acquisitions: includes fair value adjustments to the corning precision materials indemnity asset related to contingent consideration, post-combination expenses and other acquisition and disposal adjustments.
(10)   pension mark-to-market adjustment: defined benefit pension mark-to-market gains and losses, which arise from changes in actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets and discount rates.
(11)   gain on realignment of equity investment: gain recorded upon the completion of the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in dow corning.
(12)   taiwan power outage: impact of the power outage that temporarily halted production at our tainan, taiwan manufacturing location in the second quarter of 2016. the impact includes asset write-offs and charges for facility repairs, offset somewhat by partial reimbursement through our insurance program.
(13)   adjustments resulting from the 2017 tax act: includes a provisional amount related to the one-time mandatory tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings, a provisional amount related to the remeasurement of u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in valuation allowances as a result of the 2017 tax act, and adjustments for the elimination of excess foreign tax credit planning.

all other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as "all other."  this group is primarily comprised of the results of pharmaceutical technologies, auto glass, new product lines and development projects, as well as certain corporate investments such as eurokera and keraglass equity affiliates.
we prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions.  we included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segment's net income.  we have allocated certain common expenses among our reportable segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.  our reportable segments include non-gaap measures which are not prepared in accordance with gaap.  we believe investors should consider these non-gaap measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends.  these measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap reporting measures.  for a reconciliation of non-gaap performance measures to their most directly comparable gaap financial measure, please see "reconciliation of non-gaap measures" above.  segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.  the accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements.

display technologies segment net sales increased $139 million compared to the prior year.  total display glass market volume was up in 2018.  our volume growth in this market more than offset price declines on a year-over-year basis.  2018 was the best pricing environment in more than a decade, achieving the important milestone of mid-single digit year-over-year declines during the second half of the year.
net income decreased by $53 million, or 6%, mainly driven by the costs of expanding gen 10.5 capacity, ramping production and rebuilding tanks for fleet optimization during the first half of the year.
net sales decreased by $151 million, or 5%, in the year ended december 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016, driven by price declines of approximately 10%, partially offset by an increase in volume in the mid-single digits in percentage terms.
net income decreased by $65 million, or 7%, driven by the following items:
·   an increase of $40 million in research, development and engineering expenses, primarily driven by the absence of the impact of a 2016 joint development agreement.
the decrease in net income was partially offset by the following items:
·   a mid-single digit percentage increase in volume; and
·   improvements in manufacturing efficiency, which added $68 million.
for full-year 2019, corning expects the display glass market to grow by a mid-single digit percentage, consistent with 2018.  the company expects corning's volume to grow faster than the market due to expansion of our gen 10.5 manufacturing capacity in china.  2018 was the best pricing environment in more than a decade achieving the important milestone of mid-single digit year-over-year declines in the second half of the year.  we expect our full year 2019 price declines to improve further to a mid-single digit percentage and to be even better than they were in 2018.

liquidity and capital resources financing and capital structure the following items discuss corning's financing and changes in capital structure during 2018 and 2017:
in the second quarter of 2018, corning issued ¥65.5 billion japanese yen-denominated debt securities in tranches of 7, 10 and 12 years.  the proceeds from these notes were received in japanese yen and immediately converted to u.s. dollars on the date of issuance.  the net proceeds received in u.s. dollars, after deducting offering expenses, was $596 million.  payments of principal and interest on the notes will be in japanese yen, or should yen be unavailable due to circumstances beyond corning's control, a u.s. dollar equivalent.  the net proceeds of $596 million will be used for general corporate purposes.
in the third quarter of 2018, corning amended and restated its revolving credit agreement (the "revolving credit agreement").  the revolving credit agreement provides a $1.5 billion unsecured multi-currency line of credit and expires august 15, 2023.  the revolving credit agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which corning must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant.  the required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%.
index in the fourth quarter of 2018, corning issued $900 million u.s. dollar-denominated unsecured long-term notes in tranches of 19, 30, and 50 years.  the net proceeds of $889 million will be used for general corporate purposes.  we can redeem these notes at any time, subject to certain terms and conditions.
in the third quarter of 2017, corning issued ¥78 billion japanese yen-denominated debt securities in tranches of 7, 10 and 20 years.  the proceeds from these notes were received in japanese yen and immediately converted to u.s. dollars on the date of issuance.  the net proceeds received in u.s. dollars, after deducting offering expenses, was approximately $700 million.  payments of principal and interest on the notes will be in japanese yen, or should yen be unavailable due to circumstances beyond corning's control, a u.s. dollar equivalent.  the net proceeds of $700 million were made available for general corporate purposes.
in the fourth quarter of 2017, corning issued $750 million of 4.375% senior unsecured notes that mature on november 15, 2057.  the net proceeds of $743 million will be used for general corporate purposes.  we can redeem these notes at any time, subject to certain terms and conditions.
on a quarterly basis, corning will recognize the transaction gains and losses resulting from changes in the jpy/usd exchange rate in the other expense, net line of the consolidated statements of income.  cash proceeds from the offerings and payments for debt issuance costs are disclosed as financing activities, and cash payments to bondholders for interest will be disclosed as operating activities, in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
common stock dividends on february 1, 2017, corning's board of directors declared a 14.8% increase in the company's quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $0.135 to $0.155 per share of common stock, beginning with the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2017.
on february 6, 2018, corning's board of directors declared a 16.1% increase in the company's quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $0.155 to $0.18 per share of common stock, beginning with the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2018.
on february 6, 2019, corning's board of directors declared an 11.1% increase in the company's quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $0.18 to $0.20 per share of common stock, beginning with the dividend paid in the first quarter of 2019.  this increase marks the eighth dividend increase since october 2011.
fixed rate cumulative convertible preferred stock, series a corning has 2,300 outstanding shares of fixed rate cumulative convertible preferred stock, series a.  the preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder and the company upon certain events, at a conversion rate of 50,000 shares of corning's common stock per one share of preferred stock, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions.  as of december 31, 2018, the preferred stock has not been converted, and none of the anti-dilution provisions have been triggered.    © 2019 corning incorporated. all rights reserved.
index customer deposits as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, corning had customer deposits of approximately $1.0 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively.  the majority of these represent non-refundable cash deposits for customers to secure rights to an amount of glass produced by corning under long-term supply agreements.  the duration of these long-term supply agreements ranges up to ten years.  as glass is shipped to customers, corning will recognize revenue and issue credit memoranda to reduce the amount of the customer deposit liability, which are applied against customer receivables resulting from the sale of glass.  no credit memoranda were issued in 2018 and 2017.
capital spending capital spending totaled $2.2 billion in 2018, an increase of approximately $0.4 billion when compared to 2017, driven by expansions related to the gen 10.5 glass manufacturing facilities in china, the addition of capacity to support the new gas particulate filters business in the environmental technologies segment, fiber and cable capacity in the optical communications segment and general business growth in the specialty materials segment.  we expect our 2019 capital expenditures to be slightly more than $2.0 billion.
cash flows summary of cash flow data (in millions):
net cash provided by operating activities             $2,919              $2,004                   $2,537
net cash (used in) provided by investing activities   $(2,887)            $(1,710)                 $3,662
net cash used in financing activities                 $(1,995)            $(1,624)               $(5,322)
net cash provided by operating activities increased by $915 million in the year ended december 31, 2018 when compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by an increase in customer incentives and deposits of $600 million.  favorable movements of $189 million in accounts payable and other current liabilities were driven largely by an increase in accounts payable in the optical communications segment and higher current liabilities in the specialty materials segment.  cash received of $104 million, which represents the excess of the fair value of the contingent consideration asset related to the acquisition of samsung corning precision materials (refer to note 14 (fair value measurements) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information), also increased cash provided by operating activities.
net cash used in investing activities increased by $1,177 million in the year ended december 31, 2018, when compared to the same period last year, driven by increased capital expenditures of $438 million due to capacity expansions, increased acquisition spending of $671million and lower gains realized on translated earnings contracts of $162 million.  cash received of $196 million, which represents the original fair value of the contingent consideration asset related to the acquisition of samsung corning precision materials (refer to note 14 (fair value measurements) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information), partially offset the net cash used in investing activities.
net cash used in financing activities in the year ended december 31, 2018 increased by $371 million when compared to the same period last year, driven by higher debt repayments, up $377 million and a decrease of $228 million for proceeds from the exercise of stock options.  a decrease of $225 million in share repurchases partially offset the negative cash impact of these items.
net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $533 million in the year ended december 31, 2017 when compared to the same period last year, driven by $501 million of unfavorable movements in working capital.  the negative impact of working capital changes was largely driven by an increase of $143 million in vat receivables in asia, a payment of $70 million related to our obligation under the plan of reorganization for pcc (refer to note 12 (commitments, contingencies and guarantees) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information), an increase in accounts receivable and inventory to support growth in the optical communications, environmental technologies and specialty materials segments.
net cash used in investing activities increased by $5.4 billion in the year ended december 31, 2017, when compared to the same period last year, driven by the absence of $4.8 billion of cash received in the second quarter of 2016 on the realignment of dow corning, coupled with an increase of $674 million in capital expenditures largely due to capacity expansions and a decline of $92 million in liquidations of short-term investments.  a decline of $162 million in acquisition spending partially offset these events.
net cash used in financing activities in the year ended december 31, 2017 decreased by $3.7 billion when compared to the same period last year, driven by lower share repurchases, down $1.8 billion, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $1.4 billion, the absence of $481 million of commercial paper repayments made in 2016 and an increase of $171 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
defined benefit pension plans we have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees.  our largest single pension plan is corning's u.s. qualified plan.  at december 31, 2018, this plan accounted for 76% of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans' projected benefit obligation and 85% of the related plans' assets.
in 2018, we made voluntary cash contributions of $105 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $12 million to our international pension plans.  in 2017, we made no voluntary cash contributions to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $29 million to our international pension plans.  during 2019, we anticipate making cash contributions of $75 million to our u.s. qualified pension plan and $31 million to our international pension plans.

index management assessment of liquidity we ended the fourth quarter of 2018 with approximately $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents.  our cash and cash equivalents are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally unrestricted.  we utilize a variety of strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.  at december 31, 2018, approximately 56% of the consolidated amount was held outside of the united states.  during 2018, the company distributed approximately $2.2 billion in cash from foreign subsidiaries to the u.s. parent.  there were no incremental taxes beyond the toll charge due with respect to this distribution of cash.
corning also has a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $1.5 billion.  under this program, the company may issue the paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.  the company's revolving credit agreement is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed.  at december 31, 2018 corning did not have outstanding commercial paper.
share repurchases during 2016, corning repurchased 197.1 million shares for approximately $4.2 billion through an accelerated share repurchase agreement and open market repurchases as part of the 2015 repurchase programs.  in december 2016, corning's board of directors approved a $4 billion share repurchase program with no expiration (the "2016 repurchase program").

other we complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk.  we closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues.  we currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues.
our major source of funding for 2019 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from any issuances of debt.  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchase programs.
our revolving credit agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant.  the required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%.  at december 31, 2018, our leverage using this measure was approximately 30%.  as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with this financial covenant.
index our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.  in addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default in excess of a specified amount on one debt obligation of the company, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument.  as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all such provisions.
management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity.  in addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources.
translated earnings contracts corning has hedged a significant portion of its projected yen exposure for the period 2018 through 2022, with average rate forwards, collars and puts.  in the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded pre-tax net losses of $96 million, $201 million and $459 million related to changes in the fair value of these instruments.  included in these amounts are realized gains of $64 million, $268 million and $207 million, respectively.  the gross notional value outstanding for these instruments which hedge our exposure to the japanese yen at december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $11.6 billion, $13 billion and $14.9 billion, respectively.
we have entered into zero-cost collars and average rate forwards to hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the south korean won and its impact on our net income.  in the year ended december 31, 2018, we recorded a pre-tax net loss of $26 million, and in the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded pre-tax net gains of $95 million and $7 million, respectively, related to changes in the fair value of these instruments.  included in these amounts is a realized gain of $46 million, and realized losses of $1 million and $7 million, respectively.  these instruments had a gross notional value outstanding at december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 of $0.1 billion, $0.8 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.
we have entered into a portfolio average rate forwards to hedge against our euro translation exposure.  in the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $43 million, a net pre-tax loss of $40 million, and a net pre-tax gain of $15 million, respectively.  included in these amounts are realized losses of $14 million and $2 million, and a realized gain of $1 million, respectively.  at december 31, 2018, the euro-denominated average rate instruments had a gross notional amount of $1.2 billion, and at 2017 and 2016, a gross notional amount of $0.3 billion.
these derivative instruments are not designated as accounting hedges, and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the translated earnings contract loss, net line of the consolidated statements of income (loss).
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.
corning's off balance sheet arrangements include guarantee contracts.  at the time a guarantee is issued, the company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes.  in the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third-party guarantees.  generally, third-party guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones.  these guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant.
refer to note 12 (commitments, contingencies and guarantees) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
index for variable interest entities, we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary.  the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity's expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests, which are the ownership, contractual, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity's net assets excluding variable interests.
corning has identified ten entities that qualify as a variable interest entity and are not consolidated.  these entities are not considered to be significant to corning's consolidated statements of position.
corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity.

index critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein.  the estimates that required us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates, are set forth below.
acquired assets and liabilities we account for the acquisition of a business using the purchase method of accounting, which requires us to estimate the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  this includes acquired intangible assets such as customer-related intangibles and patents, fixed assets and inventories.  liabilities assumed may include litigation and other contingency reserves existing at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining the related fair values.  independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities.  such appraisals are based on significant estimates provided by us, such as forecasted revenues and profits utilized in determining the fair value of contract-related acquired intangible assets or liabilities.  significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired, as well as differences in actual and estimated results could result in impacts to our financial results.  additional information related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities obtained during the allocation period, not to exceed one year, may result in changes to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities, resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired.
in 2018 we acquired cmd from 3m in a business combination.  included in the acquisition were other intangible assets consisting primarily of $434 million of customer relationships and $91 million of other intangibles that are amortized over the weighted average useful life of approximately 14 and 11 years, respectively.   the customer relationship intangible asset was valued using the multi-period excess earnings valuation method, which is an income approach method that estimates fair value of revenue based upon the present value of cash flows that are expected to be generated from the acquired customer base.  key assumptions used in this valuation include a discount rate of 12.5%, revenue growth rates in the range of 0% to 3% and a customer attrition rate of 6%.
impairment of assets held for use we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified.  we review our long-lived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present.  we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.
manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium.  these metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life.  precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long-lived assets.  this review considers all the company's precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity.  precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other non-manufacturing related purposes.
index examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include, but are not limited to:
·   a significant decrease in the market price of an asset;
·   a significant change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition;
·   a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;
·   an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;
·   a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset; and
·   a current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long-lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  our assessment is performed at the reportable segment level.  for the majority of our reportable segments, we concluded that locations or businesses within these segments which share production along the supply chain must be combined to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
for long-lived assets, when impairment indicators are present, we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the assets' carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable.  this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used.  assessments also consider changes in asset utilization, including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production.  if there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets' fair value and carrying value.  this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used.
for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability, the estimated fair value of long-lived assets is determined using an "income approach" that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long-lived assets, and considers the fair market value of all precious metals.  we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  if there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets' fair value and carrying value.  our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.  we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions.  the company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate.
at december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by $719 million and $711 million, respectively.  the majority of these precious metals are utilized by the display technologies and specialty materials segments.  corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments.  the potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments.  such events include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our display technologies or specialty materials segments.
index impairment of goodwill we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred, including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.  a reporting unit is equivalent to an operating segment or a component of an operating segment which constitutes a business and for which discrete financial information is regularly reviewed by segment management.  an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of a reporting unit's net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.
corning has recorded goodwill in the display technologies, optical communications, specialty materials, life sciences and all other operating segments.  each of these operating segments is a separate reporting unit; however, specialty materials and all other are each made up of two separate reporting units. on a quarterly basis, or if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may be impaired, management performs a qualitative assessment of factors in each reporting unit within these operating segments to determine if there have been any triggering events.  we also perform a detailed quantitative impairment test every three years if no indicators suggest a test should be performed in the interim.  we use this calculation as a quantitative validation of the qualitative process; this process does not represent an election to perform the quantitative impairment test in place of the qualitative review.
the qualitative assessment is performed by assessing various factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  these factors include, but are not limited to, changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, other relevant entity-specific events, or a sustained decrease in share price.
in 2018, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment in addition to assessing the qualitative factors each quarter.  our assessment is based on our annual strategic planning process.  this process includes an extensive review of expectations for the long-term growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows. our valuation method is an "income approach" using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate.  our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.  the quantitative assessment requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates, growth rates and the timing of expected future cash flows of the respective reporting unit.
the quantitative assessment of goodwill resulted in fair values significantly exceeding the carrying values for all of our reporting units.  we also performed a sensitivity analysis, using a range between 7-10% for the discount rate and 0%-3% for the growth rate, which had no material impact on our results.  based on the quantitative test performed in 2018, no goodwill impairment was required.
income taxes we are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets.  inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book and taxable income and possible tax planning strategies.  these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business.  it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances.
index corning accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc topic 740, income taxes, which requires that companies only record tax benefits for technical positions that are believed to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained on their technical merits and then only to the extent of the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  in estimating these amounts, we must exercise judgment around factors such as the weighting of the tax law in our favor, the willingness of a tax authority to aggressively pursue a particular position, or alternatively, consider a negotiated compromise, and our willingness to dispute a tax authorities' assertion to the level of appeal we believe is required to sustain our position.  as a result, it is possible that our estimate of the benefits we will realize for uncertain tax positions may change when we become aware of new information affecting these judgments and estimates.
as of december 31, 2018, corning has completed its analysis of the impact of the 2017 tax act as required by sab 118.
beginning in 2018, corning will indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings of: (1) any of its subsidiaries located in jurisdictions where corning lacks the ability to repatriate its earnings, (2) any of its subsidiaries where corning's intention is to reinvest those earnings in operations, (3) legal entities for which corning holds a non-controlling interest, (4) any subsidiaries with an accumulated deficit in earnings and profits and (5) any subsidiaries which have a positive earnings and profits balance but for which the entity lacks sufficient local statutory earnings or stock basis from which to make a distribution.
under the 2017 tax act, a company can make a policy election to account for the tax on gilti as a period cost or to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities when basis differences exist that are expected to affect the amount of gilti inclusion upon reversal.  corning has elected to account for the gilti provisions as a period cost.
fair value measures as required, corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities: observable and unobservable.  observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on the company's own market assumptions.  once inputs have been characterized, we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels.  characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement.  in addition, observable market data must be used when available and the highest-and-best-use measure should be applied to non-financial assets.  corning's major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are short-term and long-term investments, certain pension asset investments and derivatives.  these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions.
derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities.  included in our forward exchange contracts are foreign currency hedges that hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the japanese yen, south korean won, euro, new taiwan dollar, chinese yuan and british pound.  these contracts are not designated as accounting hedges, and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the translated earnings contract loss, net line of the consolidated statements of income (loss).  in arriving at the fair value of corning's derivative assets and liabilities, we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria, including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction.  amounts related to credit risk are not material.
refer to note 14 (fair value measurements) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
index probability of litigation outcomes we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain.  in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter, case law, and other case-specific issues.  see part ii - item 3. legal proceedings for a discussion of corning's material litigation matters.
other possible liabilities we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain.  in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters, including certain tax planning and environmental matters, these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure.  it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals.
pension and other postretirement employee benefits (opeb)
corning offers employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents.  the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company's assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates), expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates.  the cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover and plan participation.  while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning's employee pension and other postretirement obligations, and current and future expense.
costs for our defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements:  1) on-going costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs; and 2) mark-to-market gains and losses outside of the corridor, where the corridor is equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year.  these gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets.  any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment, settlement or significant plan changes, as well as any true-up to the annual valuation, are recognized as a mark-to-market adjustment in the quarter in which such event occurs.
costs for our opeb plans consist of on-going costs recognized quarterly, and are comprised of service and interest costs, amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses.  we recognize the actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions as a component of stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis and amortize them into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans, to the extent such gains and losses are outside of the corridor.
on january 1, 2018, corning adopted asu no. 2017-07, compensation retirement benefits (topic 715):  improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit cost, which presents the service cost component with other current compensation costs in operating income.  the remaining components are included in the line item other expense, net, in the consolidated statements of income (loss).  corning applied the practical expedient as the estimation basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirements.
index the following tables present our actual and expected return on assets, as well as the corresponding percentage, for the years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016:

as of december 31, 2018, the projected benefit obligation (pbo) for u.s. pension plans was $3.4 billion.
the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for u.s. pension plans:

25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets   + 7 million
25 basis point increase in expected return on assets   - 7 million the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time.  note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear.  these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning's funding requirements.
in addition, at december 31, 2018, a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would decrease stockholders' equity by $112 million before tax, and a 25 basis point increase in each spot rate would increase stockholders' equity by $107 million.  in addition, the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate.
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in each spot rate assumption related to corning's u.s. opeb plans:

index revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when all performance obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied, and control of the product has been transferred to the customer.  if customer acceptance clauses are present and it cannot be objectively determined that control has been transferred, revenue is only recorded when customer acceptance is received and all performance obligations have been satisfied.  sales of goods typically do not include multiple product and/or service elements.  corning also has contractual arrangements with certain customers in which we recognize revenue over time.  the performance obligations under these contracts generally require services to be performed over time, resulting in either a straight-line amortization method or an input method using incurred and forecasted expense to predict revenue recognition patterns which follows satisfaction of the performance obligation.
on january 1, 2018, we adopted accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2014-09 asc (topic 606), revenue from contracts with customers, and applied the modified retrospective method of accounting to those contracts which were not completed as of january 1, 2018.  results for reporting periods beginning after january 1, 2018 are presented under topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under asc topic 605 "revenue recognition". because the impact of adopting the standard on corning's financial statements was immaterial, we have not made an adjustment to opening retained earnings.
new accounting standards refer to note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies) to the consolidated financial statements.
index forward-looking statements the statements in this annual report on form 10-k, in reports subsequently filed by corning with the securities and exchange commission (sec) on form 10-q and form 8-k, and related comments by management that are not historical facts or information and contain words such as "will," "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "intend," "plan," "seek," "see," "would," and "target" and similar expressions are forward-looking statements.  such statements relate to future events that by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain.  these forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, the company's future operating performance, the company's share of new and existing markets, the company's revenue and earnings growth rates, the company's ability to innovate and commercialize new products, and the company's implementation of cost-reduction initiatives and measures to improve pricing, including the optimization of the company's manufacturing capacity.

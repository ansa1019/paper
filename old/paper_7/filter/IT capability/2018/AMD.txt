in this management's discussion and analysis (md&a), we will describe the results of operations and the financial condition for us and our consolidated subsidiaries, including a discussion of our results of operations for 2018 compared to 2017 and 2017 compared to 2016, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements.
overview our 2018 financial results demonstrate the success of our strong product roadmap execution. customers continued to adopt our high performance products as new products accounted for over 65% of our annual 2018 revenue. net revenue for 2018 was $6.5 billion, an increase of 23% compared to 2017 net revenue of $5.3 billion. gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2018, was 38%, a 4% increase compared to 34% in 2017. our operating income for 2018 improved to $451 million compared to operating income of $127 million for 2017. our net income for 2018 improved to $337 million compared to a net loss of $33 million in the prior year.
we significantly expanded our desktop processor offerings in 2018 with the launch of our second-generation amd ryzen and high-end amd ryzen threadrippertm wx processors for gamers, creators and hardware enthusiasts. we announced the availability of our first desktop consumer and commercial ryzen and ryzen pro apus that combine our high-performance "zen" cpu and radeon "vega" graphics cores into a single chip. we also introduced the first entry-level processors based on our "zen" cpu and "vega" gpu cores for the consumer and commercial desktop pc market with the amd athlontm and amd pro processors. in the notebook market, multiple customers launched premium consumer and commercial pcs featuring our mobile amd ryzen apus, including our first enterprise-class notebooks powered by our new amd ryzen pro apus. for the high-performance embedded markets, we introduced the amd epyctm embedded 3000 processor and amd ryzen embedded v1000 processor families that bring new levels of computing and graphics performance to the thin client, digital signage, and infrastructure markets.
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 29, 2018 were $1.16 billion, down from $1.18 billion at the end of 2017. principal amount of total debt as of december 29, 2018 was $1.53 billion, compared to $1.70 billion as of december 30, 2017.
we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap). the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. we evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill impairments and income taxes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with
management's expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.
management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.
revenue recognition. in accordance with the adoption of the new revenue standard effective the beginning of the first quarter of 2018, we now recognize revenue upon the shipment of the product to our distributors (sell-in), rather than upon the resale of the product by our distributors to their customers (sell-through). accordingly, we have established provisions for rights of return and price protection on unsold product held by our distributors.
revenue allowances. we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. we base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, historical allowances, historical price reductions, market activity and other known or anticipated trends and factors. these estimates are subject to management's judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.
inventory valuation. at each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook. this evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand. these projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory. in addition, we write off inventories that we consider obsolete. we adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or net realizable value. among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and realizable value. if in any period we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. this would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. if in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written down in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period.
goodwill. we perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. the analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.
qualitative factors include industry and market consideration, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and company-specific events. we first analyze qualitative factors. if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we do not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test.
a quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows to determine a reporting unit's fair value. significant estimates include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value.
a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value. any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
income taxes. in determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. these estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. if recovery is not likely, we must increase our charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. we consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance.
in addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other taxing authorities. if our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. we recognize the interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively.
in december 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (tax reform act). the legislation significantly changes u.s. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a modified territorial tax system and imposing a transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. the tax reform act permanently reduces the u.s. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective january 1, 2018. the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no. 118 (sab 118) to address the application of u.s. gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax reform act. more specifically, sab 118 allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations. as a result, we have recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 30, 2017. during 2018, we finalized our computation of the impact of the tax reform act.
in january 2018, the fasb released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income (gilti) provisions of the tax reform act. the gilti provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. the guidance allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either (i) account for gilti as a component of tax expense in the period in which they are subject to the rules (the period cost method), or (ii) account for gilti in the company's measurement of deferred taxes (the deferred method). after completing the analysis of the gilti provisions, we elected to account for gilti using the period cost method.
results of operations we report our financial performance based on the following two reportable segments:the computing and graphics segment and the enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segment.
additional information on our reportable segments is contained in note 15: segment reporting of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k).
our operating results tend to vary seasonally. historically, first quarter pc product sales were generally lower than fourth quarter sales and with respect to our semi-custom soc products for game consoles our sales pattern usually reflects higher sales in the second and third quarters compared to the first and fourth quarters.
the following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2018, 2017 and 2016.
enterprise, embedded and semi-custom       2,350               2,276               2,331
enterprise, embedded and semi-custom         163                 132                 287
computing and graphics computing and graphics net revenue of $4.1 billion in 2018 increased by 39%, compared to $3.0 billion in 2017, primarily as a result of a 15% increase in average selling price and a 17% increase in unit shipments. the increase in average selling price and unit shipments was primarily driven by higher demand for our ryzentm processors.
computing and graphics net revenue of $3.0 billion in 2017 increased by 50%, compared to $2.0 billion in 2016 as a result of a 38% increase in average selling price and a 1% increase in unit shipments. the increase in the average selling price was primarily driven by ryzen desktop processor and radeon graphics products sales. the increase in unit shipments was primarily attributable to higher demand for our radeon graphics products.
computing and graphics operating income was $470 million in 2018 compared to operating income of $92 million in 2017. the improvement in operating income was primarily driven by higher demand for ryzen and radeon products as customers continued to adopt our new products, partially offset by a $195 million increase in operating expenses. operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under "expenses" below.
computing and graphics operating income was $92 million in 2017, compared to an operating loss of $243 million in 2016. the improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by the related increase in cost of sales and operating expenses. operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under "expenses" below.
enterprise, embedded and semi-custom enterprise, embedded and semi-custom net revenue of $2.4 billion in 2018 increased by 3% compared to net revenue of $2.3 billion 2017. the increase in net revenue was primarily due to higher sales of our epyctm server products, partially offset by lower semi-custom revenue.
enterprise, embedded and semi-custom net revenue of $2.28 billion in 2017 decreased by 2% compared to net revenue of $2.33 billion in 2016. ip related revenue and sales of our epyc datacenter processors, which were launched in june of 2017, were mostly offset by a decrease in non-recurring engineering (nre) revenue and lower sales of our semi-custom soc products.
enterprise, embedded and semi-custom operating income was $163 million in 2018 compared to operating income of $132 million in 2017. the improvement in operating income was due primarily to richer server and semi-custom product mix, partially offset by a $50 million increase in operating expenses and lower ip-related revenue. in 2017, operating income also included a licensing gain of $52 million. operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under "expenses" below.
enterprise, embedded and semi-custom operating income was $132 million in 2017 compared to operating income of $287 million in 2016. the decline in operating results was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses driven primarily by datacenter-related expenses and lower licensing gain recorded in 2017 related to the licensed ip to the thatic jv compared to 2016. operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under "expenses" below.
all other all other operating loss of $182 million in 2018 included stock-based compensation expense of $137 million and an impairment of technology licenses of $45 million.
all other operating loss of $417 million in 2016 included a charge of $340 million, which was comprised of the $100 million payment under the sixth amendment and the $240 million value of the warrant under the warrant agreement with wch, and stock-based compensation expense of $86 million, partially offset by restructuring reversals of $10 million.
comparison of gross margin, expenses, interest expense, other income (expense), net income taxes and equity loss in investee the following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2018, 2017 and 2016:

gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 38% in 2018 compared to 34% in 2017. the improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the ramp of new products with higher gross margin than the corporate average.
gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 34% in 2017 compared to 23% in 2016. gross margin improved in 2017 primarily due to the absence of the charge of $340 million recorded in 2016, comprised of a $100 million payment under the sixth amendment and the value of the warrant of $240 million under the warrant agreement, which accounted for eight gross margin percentage points. in addition, the increase in gross margin percentage for 2017 compared to 2016 was due to a favorable shift in product mix to new radeon gpu and ryzen desktop processor products in the computing and graphics segment.
expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses of $1.4 billion in 2018 increased by $238 million, or 20%, compared to $1.2 billion in 2017. the increase was primarily driven by a $168 million increase in product engineering and design related costs attributable to both segments, and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance.
research and development expenses of $1.2 billion in 2017 increased by $188 million, or 19%, compared to $1.0 billion in 2016. the increase was primarily due to a $136 million increase in product engineering and design related costs attributable to both segments, and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance.
marketing, general and administrative expenses marketing, general and administrative expenses of $562 million in 2018 increased by $46 million, or 9%, compared to $516 million in 2017. the increase was primarily due to a $41 million increase in sales and marketing activities attributable to both segments and higher annual employee incentives driven by our improved financial performance.
marketing, general and administrative expenses of $516 million in 2017 increased by $50 million, or 11%, compared to $466 million in 2016. the increase was primarily due to a $29 million increase in sales and marketing activities attributable to both segments and higher annual employee incentives driven by our improved financial performance.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net of zero in 2018 changed by $9 million compared to $9 million other expense, net in 2017. the change from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to $12 million higher interest income in 2018 mainly related to a withholding tax refund from a foreign jurisdiction.
other expense, net of $9 million in 2017 changed by $89 million compared to $80 million other income, net in 2016. the change from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to the absence in 2017 of the substantial gain on sale of equity interests in atmp jv that was partially offset by loss on debt redemption in 2016.
provision (benefit) for income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of $9 million in 2018 and an income tax provision of $18 million and $39 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
the income tax benefit in 2018 was primarily due to a $36 million refund of withholding tax from a foreign jurisdiction related to a legal settlement from 2010, offset by $13 million of u.s. income taxes resulting from the tax reform act, $7 million tax provision in foreign locations and $7 million of withholding taxes on cross-border transactions.
the income tax provision in 2017 was primarily due to withholding taxes applicable to ip-related revenue and licensing gains from foreign locations.
the income tax provision in 2016 was primarily due to $41 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations including $27 million attributable to a gain on the sale of 85% of the ownership interest in the subsidiary operating a factory in suzhou and $9 million of withholding taxes on cross-border transactions where no foreign tax credit is expected to be realizable, offset by $2 million of tax benefits for canadian tax credits and the monetization of certain u.s. tax credits.
international sales international sales as a percentage of net revenue were 80% in 2018 and 74% in 2017. the increase in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by a higher proportion of revenue from china and taiwan related to sales of our products within the computing and graphics segment.
international sales as a percentage of net revenue were 74% in 2017 and 79% in 2016. the decrease in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by a higher proportion of revenue from domestic sales of our desktop processors, graphics processors and semi-custom soc products.
we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in u.s. dollars.
financial condition liquidity and capital resources as of december 29, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $1.16 billion compared to $1.18 billion as of december 30, 2017. the percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 88% as of december 29, 2018, and 95% as of december 30, 2017. our operating, investing and financing activities for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:
operating activities                                                            $34               $12               $81
investing activities                                                           (170   )           (54   )           277
financing activities                                                             28               (33   )           122
we believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance along with our secured revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next 12 months. we believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. however, we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all.
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $34 million in 2018 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $12 million in 2017. the increase in net cash provided in operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital, largely driven by higher cash collections from increased revenue, partially offset by higher labor costs and timing of accounts payable payments.
net cash provided by operating activities was $12 million in 2017 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $81 million in 2016. the decrease in cash inflows from operating activities was primarily due to higher operating costs including higher wafer purchases and higher labor costs, partially offset by higher cash collection primarily due to higher revenue and lower interest payments resulting from debt reductions.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $170 million in 2018, which primarily consisted of $163 million for purchases of property and equipment, a net cash outflow from purchases and maturities of available-for-sale debt securities partially offset by collection of deferred proceeds on sale of receivables.
net cash used in investing activities was $54 million in 2017, which consisted primarily of a cash outflow of $113 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by collection of deferred proceeds on sale of receivables.
net cash provided by investing activities was $277 million in 2016, which primarily consisted of a net cash inflow of $342 million from sale of equity interests in the atmp jv, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment .
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was $28 million in 2018, which consisted of a net cash inflow of $69 million from the issuance of common stock through employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by the repurchase of an aggregate principal amount of $40 million of our outstanding 6.75% senior notes due 2019 (6.75% notes) and 7.00% senior notes due 2024 (7.00% notes) for $41 million in cash.
net cash used in financing activities was $33 million in 2017, which primarily consisted of the repurchases of an aggregate principal amount of $103 million of our outstanding 6.75% notes and 7.00% notes for $110 million in cash and $13 million for tax withholding on the vesting of restricted stock, partially offset by the $70 million net proceeds from our secured revolving line of credit and the $20 million proceeds from issuance of common stock under stock-based compensation equity plans.
net cash provided by financing activities was $122 million in 2016, which primarily consisted of the $782 million net proceeds from the issuance of our 2.125% convertible senior notes due 2026 (2.125% notes), the $667 million net proceeds from selling 115 million shares of our common stock and the $20 million proceeds from issuance of common stock under stock-based compensation equity plans, partially offset by the repurchases of an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion of our outstanding 6.75% notes, 7.75% senior notes due 2020 (7.75% notes), 7.50% senior notes due 2022 (7.50% notes) and 7.00% notes for $1.1 billion in cash and repayments in aggregate of $230 million of our secured revolving line of credit.

(2)   represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding debt obligations that are payable in cash, excluding non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount.
(3)   we have purchase obligations for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on the volume or type of services we acquire. in those cases, we only included the minimum volume of purchase obligations in the table above. purchase orders for goods and services that are cancellable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above.
(4)   subsequent to the year end, on january 28, 2019, we entered into a seventh amendment with gf, which among other terms modified our minimum wafer purchase obligations to gf which are reflected in the above table. these minimum purchase obligations are our contractual minimums and do not necessarily reflect our actual expected expenditures, which could be significantly different. we cannot meaningfully quantify or estimate our future purchase obligations to gf beyond 2021 but expect that our future purchases from gf will continue to be material.
(5)   total amount excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets except for debt obligations and other liabilities related to software and technology licenses and ip licenses.

if we undergo a fundamental change prior to the maturity date of the notes, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.

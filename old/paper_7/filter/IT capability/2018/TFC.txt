key challenges bb&t's business is dynamic and complex. consequently, management annually evaluates and, as necessary, adjusts the company's business strategy in the context of the current operating environment. during this process, management considers the current financial condition and performance of the company and its expectations for future economic activity from both a national and local market perspective. the achievement of key strategic objectives and established long-term financial goals is subject to many uncertainties and challenges. in the opinion of management, the challenges that are most relevant and likely to have a near term impact on performance are presented below:
•   consummation of the merger of equals with suntrust, including fully achieving the potential benefits.
•   intense competition within the financial services industry given the challenge in growing assets.
•   global economic and geopolitical risk, including potential financial system instability.
•   cost and risk associated with regulatory initiatives and it projects.
in addition, certain other challenges and unforeseen events could have a near term impact on bb&t's financial condition and results of operations. see the sections titled "forward-looking statements" and "risk factors" for additional examples of such challenges.
the nim is the primary measure used in evaluating the gross profit margin from the portfolios of earning assets. the nim was 3.46% for the year ended december 31, 2018, flat compared to the same period of 2017. the annualized te yield on the average securities portfolio for the year ended december 31, 2018 was 2.49%, up four basis points compared to the same period of 2017. the annualized te yield for the total loan portfolio for the year ended december 31, 2018 was 4.77%, up 36 basis points compared to the corresponding period of 2017. the increase was primarily due to rate increases, partially offset by runoff in pci loans.
the average annualized cost of total deposits for the year ended december 31, 2018 was 0.41%, up 19 basis points compared to the prior year. the average annualized cost of interest-bearing deposits for the year ended december 31, 2018 was 0.62%, up 30 basis points compared to the prior year. the average annualized rate on short-term borrowings was 1.86% for the year ended december 31, 2018, up 92 basis points compared to the same period in 2017. the increase in the rate on short-term borrowed funds primarily reflects increases in the targeted federal funds rate, which went up 100 basis points during 2018 and was a range of 2.25% to 2.50% as of the end of 2018. the average annualized rate on long-term debt for the year ended december 31, 2018 was 2.88%, up 78 basis points compared to the same period in 2017.
the nim was 3.46% in 2017 compared with 3.39% in 2016. the increase in the nim reflects higher yields on loans and securities, partially offset by higher funding costs. the average annualized te yield for total loans and leases was 4.41% for 2017, compared to 4.30% for the prior year. the increase was primarily due to rate increases, partially offset by runoff in pci loans. the te yield on the total securities portfolio was 2.45% for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to 2.33% for the prior year.
the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits for 2017 increased to 0.32%, from 0.23% in 2016. this primarily reflects the impact of rate increases.

33 bb&t corporation provision for credit losses
the provision for credit losses totaled $566 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to $547 million for 2017. the ratio of the alll to net charge-offs was 2.98x for 2018, compared to 2.78x for 2017.
the provision for credit losses was $547 million in 2017, compared to $572 million in the prior year. the decrease in the provision for credit losses was primarily driven by improvement in the commercial and industrial portfolio, which reflects lower net charge-offs and nonaccrual loans compared to the prior year. the ratio of the alll to net charge-offs was 2.78x for 2017, compared to 2.80x for 2016.
net charge-offs were $537 million for 2017 compared to $532 million in 2016. the ratio of net charge-offs to average loans and leases held for investment was 0.38% for both 2017 and 2016. net charge-offs increased by $31 million in the indirect lending portfolio, driven by an increase in loss severity associated with used car values. commercial and industrial net charge-offs decreased $40 million, primarily due to losses in the energy portfolio during 2016.
noninterest income noninterest income is a significant contributor to bb&t's financial results. management focuses on diversifying its sources of revenue to further reduce bb&t's reliance on traditional spread-based interest income, as certain fee-based activities are a relatively stable revenue source during periods of changing interest rates.

income from bb&t's insurance agency/brokerage operations was the largest source of noninterest income in 2018. insurance income was $1.9 billion, up $98 million compared to 2017, primarily due to the acquisition of regions insurance, which contributed $67 million, and higher production.
service charges on deposits were up slightly, but were negatively impacted due to fee waivers associated with the february system outage.
other income was $420 million, down $47 million, primarily due to $56 million in lower income related to assets for certain post-employment benefits, which is primarily offset in other income/expense categories.
insurance income totaled $1.8 billion for 2017, an increase of $41 million compared to 2016. the increase was largely due to the acquisition of swett and crawford on april 1, 2016. in addition, organic commissions and fees were higher, which was offset by lower performance based commissions.
service charges on deposits were $706 million for 2017, an increase of $42 million compared to 2016. the increase was due to changes in client behavior, pricing increases and the acquisition of national penn on april 1, 2016.
other income totaled $467 million for 2017, an increase of $247 million from 2016, primarily due to the termination of the loss sharing agreements during the third quarter of 2016, which resulted in a $142 million improvement compared to 2016. in addition, other income increased $34 million from sbic investments and $50 million from income related to assets for certain post-employment benefits.
outside it services                                   132                 160                 186             (17.5   )              (14.0        )
personnel expense is the largest component of noninterest expense and includes salaries and incentives, as well as pension service costs and other employee benefit costs. personnel expense was $4.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018, an increase of $87 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. this increase was driven by $43 million of personnel expense resulting from the regions insurance acquisition and $38 million in higher defined benefit pension plan service cost. in addition, capitalized employee costs were $31 million lower due to efficiencies in the loan closing process, and incentive expense, excluding regions insurance, was $12 million higher primarily due to higher performance-based incentive expense, partially offset by the 2017 one-time bonus of $36 million paid to associates who do not generally receive incentives or commissions. these increases were partially offset by a $47 million decrease for certain post-employment benefits, which is offset by lower noninterest income.
occupancy and equipment expense decreased $26 million primarily related to cost savings from facilities.
35 bb&t corporation outside it services decreased $28 million due to lower use of outside it services in the current year compared to the prior year.
merger-related and restructuring expense was $146 million, an increase of $31 million. this includes higher charges as a result of restructuring initiatives in 2018, including $61 million of personnel costs for severance and other benefits and $63 million related to costs to exit facilities. these restructuring activities will enable continued investment in the company's digital strategy, while maintaining disciplined cost control.
other expense decreased $177 million primarily due to the prior year including a $100 million contribution to bb&t's philanthropic fund and a $61 million benefit primarily from higher income on pension plan assets.
noninterest expense totaled $7.4 billion for 2017, an increase of $723 million from 2016. the increase includes actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with the passage of tax reform legislation. this included a contribution of $100 million to bb&t's philanthropic fund and $36 million for a one-time bonus paid to associates who do not generally receive incentives or commissions. the increase also includes a $392 million charge in 2017 for the early extinguishment of $2.9 billion of higher cost fhlb advances.
personnel expense is the largest component of noninterest expense and includes salaries and incentives, as well as pension service costs and other employee benefit costs. personnel expense totaled $4.2 billion, a $197 million increase compared to 2016. salaries and incentives increased $120 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher incentives as a result of improved performance and the one-time bonus previously mentioned. equity based compensation increased $14 million and benefit costs increased $63 million. the increase in benefit costs was primarily the result of an increase of $43 million for post-employment benefits that is primarily offset in other income.
outside it services expense decreased $26 million compared to the prior year, while professional services expense increased $21 million. these fluctuations are due to the volume of project related work in the current year compared to the prior year.
merger-related and restructuring expense decreased $56 million compared to 2016. this includes a decrease in merger-related charges, partially offset by branch closures and other restructuring initiatives.
other expense increased $143 million primarily due to higher operating charge-offs and charitable contributions. operating charge-offs increased $108 million due to a net benefit of $73 million recorded in 2016 related to the settlement of matters involving the origination of certain legacy mortgage loans insured by the fha. charitable contributions increased $44 million as the company made a $100 million contribution to its philanthropic fund in 2017 as noted above, compared to $50 million made in the third quarter of 2016.
•   severance and personnel-related costs or credits;
•   occupancy and equipment charges or credits, which relate to costs or gains associated with lease terminations, obsolete equipment write-offs and the sale of duplicate facilities and equipment;
•   professional services, which relate to investment banking advisory fees and other consulting services pertaining to restructuring initiatives or transactions;
•   systems conversion and related charges, which represent costs to integrate the acquired entity's information technology systems; and
•   other merger-related and restructuring charges or credits, which include expenses necessary to convert and combine the acquired branches and operations of merged companies, direct media advertising related to the acquisitions, asset and supply inventory write-offs, and other similar charges.
merger-related and restructuring accruals are established when the costs are incurred or once all requirements for a plan to dispose of or outsource certain business functions have been approved by management. for acquisitions, a major portion of accrued costs are typically utilized in conjunction with or immediately following the systems conversion, when most of the duplicate positions are eliminated and the terminated employees begin to receive severance. other accruals are utilized over time based on the sale, closing or disposal of duplicate facilities or equipment or the expiration of lease contracts. merger and restructuring accruals are re-evaluated periodically and adjusted as necessary. the remaining accruals at december 31, 2018 are generally expected to be utilized within one year, unless they relate to specific contracts that expire later.
table 7: merger-related and restructuring accrual activity
the 2018 costs primarily reflect higher charges as a result of restructuring initiatives, including costs for severance and other benefits and costs related to exiting facilities, while the 2017 costs primarily reflect branch closures and other restructuring initiatives.
provision for income taxes bb&t's provision for income taxes totaled $803 million, $911 million and $1.1 billion for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. bb&t's effective tax rates for the years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 19.8%, 27.4% and 30.2%, respectively. bb&t has extended credit to and invested in the obligations of states and municipalities and their agencies and has made other investments and loans that produce tax-exempt income. the income generated from these investments, together with certain other transactions that have favorable tax treatment, have reduced bb&t's overall effective tax rate from the statutory rate in all periods presented. the lower effective tax rate for 2018 was due to the impact of tax reform legislation. the lower effective tax rate for 2017 was due to a net tax benefit of $43 million related to the impact of tax reform.
refer to the "note 11. income taxes" for a reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the statutory tax rate and a discussion of uncertain tax positions and other tax matters.
segment results see "note 19. operating segments" for additional disclosures related to bb&t's operating segments, the internal accounting and reporting practices used to manage these segments and financial disclosures for these segments. fluctuations in noninterest income and noninterest expense incurred directly by the segments are more fully discussed in the "noninterest income" and "noninterest expense" sections above.

community banking retail and consumer finance cb-retail had 1,879 banking offices at december 31, 2018, a decrease of 170 offices compared to december 31, 2017. the decrease in offices was primarily driven by the consolidation of nearby financial centers and the closure of certain lower volume branches.
37 bb&t corporation cb-retail net income was $1.5 billion in 2018, an increase of $391 million, or 35.8%, compared to 2017. segment net interest income increased $170 million primarily due to higher funding spreads on deposits and an improvement in loan mix, partially offset by lower credit spreads on loans. noninterest income decreased primarily due to a decline in mortgage banking income driven by lower gain-on-sale margins and retaining more production on the balance sheet. this decline was partially offset by an increase in bankcard fees and merchant discounts, service charges on deposits and checkcard fees. noninterest expense decreased $70 million primarily due to declines in personnel expense, loan-related expense and occupancy and equipment expense, partially offset by an increase in merger-related and restructuring charges. the provision for income taxes decreased $167 million due to the lower federal tax rate compared to the earlier period.

insurance holdings ih net income was $161 million in 2017, a decrease of $5 million, or 3.0%, compared to 2016. noninterest income increased $46 million, which reflects the acquisition of swett and crawford in april 2016 and higher property and casualty insurance commissions, as well as higher life insurance commissions and employee benefit commissions. noninterest expense increased $66 million, primarily driven by higher personnel expense and allocated corporate expenses, both of which are primarily attributable to the swett and crawford acquisition.
other, treasury and corporate ot&c net loss was $162 million in 2017, compared to net income of $56 million in 2016. segment net interest income decreased $123 million, primarily due to the inclusion of national penn results for a portion of the earlier period, a decline in average pci loans and an increase in short-term borrowings, partially offset by an increase in average securities. noninterest income increased $151 million, primarily driven by a $142 million improvement in fdic loss share income as a result of terminating the loss share agreements in the third quarter of 2016. also, there were increases in income related to assets for certain post-employment benefits and income from sbic private equity investments, partially offset by securities gains recognized in the earlier period. the allocated provision for credit losses decreased $19 million, primarily due to credit losses for pci loans. noninterest expense increased $488 million, primarily due to the first quarter 2017 loss of $392 million on the early extinguishment of higher-cost fhlb advances, as well as higher personnel expense driven by a change in allocation approach for capitalized loan origination costs and higher expense related to assets for certain post-employment benefits. additionally, 2017 included a $100 million charitable contribution made to bb&t's philanthropic fund compared to a $50 million charitable contribution in 2016. other increases to noninterest expense include professional services and software expense, partially offset by an increase in allocated corporate expenses that were allocated to other operating segments, lower merger-related and restructuring charges, and a decline in outside it services. the benefit for income taxes increased $223 million as the first quarter of 2017 included $35 million of excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation plans and the fourth quarter of 2017 included a net tax benefit of $43 million due to the impact of tax reform.
analysis of financial condition investment activities bb&t's board-approved investment policy is carried out by the mrlcc, which meets regularly to review the economic environment and establish investment strategies. the mrlcc also has much broader responsibilities, which are discussed in the "market risk management" section in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
investment strategies are reviewed by the mrlcc based on the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix, actual and anticipated loan demand, funding opportunities and the overall interest rate sensitivity of the company. in general, the goals of the investment portfolio are: (i) to provide a sufficient margin of liquid assets to meet unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations and overall funds management objectives; (ii) to provide eligible securities to secure public funds, trust deposits as prescribed by law and other borrowings; and (iii) to earn an optimal return on funds invested commensurate with meeting the requirements of (i) and (ii) and consistent with our risk appetite.
branch bank invests in securities allowable under bank regulations. these securities may include obligations of the u.s. treasury, u.s. government agencies, gses (including mbs), bank eligible obligations of any state or political subdivision, non-agency mbs, structured notes, bank eligible corporate obligations (including corporate debentures), commercial paper, negotiable cds, bankers acceptances, mutual funds and limited types of equity securities. branch bank also may deal in securities subject to the provisions of the gramm-leach-bliley act. bb&t's full-service brokerage and investment banking subsidiary engages in the underwriting, trading and sales of equity and debt securities subject to the risk management policies of the company.

the securities portfolio totaled $45.6 billion at december 31, 2018, compared to $47.6 billion at december 31, 2017, primarily driven by a $2.4 billion decrease in agency mbs and a $714 million decrease in securities issued by state and political subdivisions, partially offset by a $1.2 billion increase in u.s. treasury securities.
as of december 31, 2018, approximately 6.5% of the securities portfolio was variable rate, compared to 5.8% as of december 31, 2017. the effective duration of the securities portfolio was 4.8 years at december 31, 2018, compared to 4.7 years at december 31, 2017. the duration of the securities portfolio excludes certain non-agency mbs.

(1)   yields represent interest computed using the effective interest method on a te basis using marginal income tax rates and the amortized cost of the securities.
(2)   for purposes of the maturity table, mbs, which are not due at a single maturity date, have been included in maturity groupings based on the contractual maturity. the expected life of mbs will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay the underlying mortgage loans.
lending activities the primary goal of the bb&t lending function is to help clients achieve their financial goals by providing quality loan products that are fair to the client and profitable to the company. management believes that this purpose can best be accomplished by building strong, profitable client relationships over time, with bb&t becoming an important contributor to the prosperity and well-being of its clients. in addition to the importance placed on client knowledge and continuous involvement with clients, bb&t's lending process incorporates the standards of a consistent company-wide credit culture and an in-depth local market knowledge. furthermore, the company employs strict underwriting criteria governing the degree of assumed risk and the diversity of the loan portfolio in terms of type, industry and geographical concentration. in this context, bb&t strives to meet the credit needs of clients in its markets while pursuing a balanced strategy of loan profitability, loan growth and loan quality.
bb&t lends to a diverse customer base that is geographically dispersed, substantially within bb&t's branch network in the southeastern and mid-atlantic united states, to mitigate concentration risk arising from local and regional economic downturns. international loans were immaterial as of december 31, 2018 and 2017. refer to the "risk management" section for a discussion of each of the loan portfolios and the credit risk management policies used to manage the portfolios.

scheduled repayments are reported in the maturity category in which the payment is due. determinations of maturities are based on contractual terms. bb&t's credit policy typically does not permit automatic renewal of loans. at the scheduled maturity date (including balloon payment date), the customer generally must request a new loan to replace the matured loan and execute either a new note or note modification with rate, terms and conditions negotiated at that time.

certain residential mortgage loans have an initial period where the borrower is only required to pay the periodic interest. after the interest-only period, the loan will require the payment of both interest and principal over the remaining term. the outstanding balances of residential mortgage loans in the interest-only phase were approximately $64 million and $126 million at december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, respectively. at december 31, 2018, approximately 95.9% of the interest-only balances will begin amortizing within the next three years compared to 95.0% at december 31, 2017.
home equity lines, which are a component of the direct retail portfolio, generally require interest-only payments during the first 15 years after origination. after this initial period, the outstanding balance begins amortizing and requires the payment of both interest and principal. at december 31, 2018, the direct retail lending portfolio includes $7.2 billion of variable rate home equity lines and $1.1 billion of variable rate other lines of credit. approximately $5.7 billion of the variable rate home equity lines is currently in the interest-only phase and approximately 10.3% of these balances will begin amortizing within the next three years. approximately $949 million of the outstanding balance of variable rate other lines of credit is in the interest-only phase and 15.9% of these balances will begin amortizing within the next three years. variable rate home equity lines and other lines of credit typically reset on a monthly basis.

average revolving credit increased $123 million due to a new product launched early in the third quarter. bb&t made changes to its credit card products to offer more attractive features to existing clients and attract new clients.
asset quality the following tables summarize asset quality information for the past five years:

asset quality continued to improve in 2018. nonperforming assets totaled $585 million at december 31, 2018, down $42 million compared to december 31, 2017. nonperforming loans and leases represented 0.35% of loans and leases held for investment, a five basis point decrease compared to december 31, 2017.
problem loans include npls and loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing as disclosed in table 15. in addition, for the commercial portfolio segment, loans that are rated special mention or substandard performing are closely monitored by management as potential problem loans. refer to "note 3. loans and acl" herein for additional disclosures related to these potential problem loans.
table 16: asset quality ratios as of / for the year ended december 31,                                                               2018             2017             2016             2015             2014
(1)   this asset quality ratio has been adjusted to remove the impact of government guaranteed mortgage loans and pci. management believes the inclusion of such assets in this asset quality ratio results in distortion of this ratio such that it might not be reflective of asset collectability or might not be comparable to other periods presented or to other portfolios that do not have government guarantees or were not impacted by pci accounting requirements.
the following table presents activity related to npas:
tdrs occur when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties in the near-term and a concession has been granted to the borrower. as a result, bb&t will work with the borrower to prevent further difficulties and ultimately improve the likelihood of recovery on the loan. to facilitate this process, a concessionary modification that would not otherwise be considered may be granted, resulting in classification of the loan as a tdr.
the following table provides a summary of performing tdr activity:
tdrs may be removed under certain conditions due to the passage of time. see additional disclosures included in "note 1. basis of presentation". these loans were previously considered tdrs as a result of structural concessions such as extended interest-only terms or an amortization period that did not otherwise conform to normal underwriting guidelines.
in addition, certain loans may be removed from classification as a tdr as a result of a subsequent non-concessionary re-modification. non-concessionary re-modifications represent tdrs that did not contain concessionary terms at the date of a subsequent renewal/modification and there was a reasonable expectation that the borrower would continue to comply with the terms of the loan subsequent to the date of the re-modification. a re-modification may be considered for such a re-classification if the loan has not had a forgiveness of principal or interest and the modified terms qualify as more than minor such that the re-modified loan is considered a new loan. alternatively, such loans may be considered for reclassification in years subsequent to the date of the re-modification based on the passage of time as described in the preceding paragraph.
in connection with consumer loan tdrs, a npl will be returned to accruing status when current as to principal and interest and upon a sustained historical repayment performance (generally a minimum of six months).

the acl consists of the alll, which is presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets, and the rufc, which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. the acl totaled $1.7 billion at december 31, 2018, up $42 million compared to december 31, 2017.
the alll, excluding pci, was $1.5 billion, up $87 million compared to december 31, 2017. the allowance for pci loans was $9 million, down $19 million compared to december 31, 2017. as of december 31, 2018, the total allowance for loan and lease losses was 1.05% of loans and leases held for investment, compared to 1.04% at december 31, 2017. these amounts include acquired loans, which were marked to fair value and did not receive an alll at the acquisition date.
revolving credit                       117                      2.1                             108                      2.0                            106                      1.9                            104                      1.8                            110                      2.1
bb&t monitors the performance of its home equity loans and lines secured by second liens similarly to other consumer loans and utilizes assumptions specific to these loans in determining the necessary alll. bb&t also receives notification when the first lien holder, whether bb&t or another financial institution, has initiated foreclosure proceedings against the borrower. when notified that the first lien is in the process of foreclosure, bb&t obtains valuations to determine if any additional charge-offs or reserves are warranted. these valuations are updated at least annually thereafter.
bb&t has limited ability to monitor the delinquency status of the first lien, unless the first lien is held or serviced by bb&t. as a result, using migration assumptions that are based on historical experience and adjusted for current trends, bb&t estimates the volume of second lien positions where the first lien is delinquent and adjusts the alll to reflect the increased risk of loss on these credits. finally, bb&t also provides additional reserves for second lien positions when the estimated combined current loan to value ratio for the credit exceeds 100%. as of december 31, 2018, bb&t held or serviced the first lien on 29.8% of its second lien positions.
funding activities deposits are the primary source of funds for lending and investing activities. scheduled payments, as well as prepayments, and maturities from portfolios of loans and investment securities also provide a stable source of funds. fhlb advances, other secured borrowings, federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowed funds, as well as long-term debt issued through the capital markets, all provide supplemental liquidity sources. funding activities are monitored and governed through bb&t's overall asset/liability management process, which is further discussed in the "market risk management" section in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." the following section provides a brief description of the various sources of funds.
deposits deposits are attracted principally from clients within bb&t's branch network through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments to individuals and businesses, including noninterest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, cds and iras. deposit account terms vary with respect to the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit and service charge schedules. interest rates paid on specific deposit types are determined based on (i) the interest rates offered by competitors, (ii) the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs, (iii) the availability and cost of alternative sources of funding, and (iv) anticipated future economic conditions and interest rates. deposits are attractive sources of funding because of their stability and relative cost.
deposits totaled $161.2 billion at december 31, 2018, an increase of $3.8 billion from december 31, 2017. noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $742 million, driven by decreases in commercial balances as businesses deployed their capital in other investments. interest checking increased $453 million, primarily due to increases in commercial balances. money market and savings increased $710 million driven by increases in commercial and personal balances, partially offset by decreases in public balances. time deposits increased $3.4 billion driven by increases in commercial balances.

borrowings the types of short-term borrowings that have been, or may be, used by the company include federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, master notes, commercial paper, short-term bank notes and short-term fhlb advances. while deposits remain the primary source for funding loan originations, management uses short-term borrowings as a supplementary funding source for loan growth and other balance sheet management purposes. the following table summarizes certain information for the past three years with respect to short-term borrowings:
securities sold under agreements to repurchase:
long-term debt provides funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital, and primarily consists of senior and subordinated notes issued by bb&t and branch bank. long-term debt totaled $23.7 billion at december 31, 2018, an increase of $61 million compared to december 31, 2017. the average cost of long-term debt was 2.88% in 2018, up 78 basis points compared to 2017.
fhlb advances represented 7.4% of total outstanding long-term debt at december 31, 2018, compared to 10.5% at december 31, 2017. see "note 8. long-term debt" for additional disclosures.
shareholders' equity total shareholders' equity was $30.2 billion at december 31, 2018, an increase of $483 million from december 31, 2017. significant additions include net income of $3.3 billion. significant decreases include common and preferred dividends totaling $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion of share repurchases. bb&t's book value per common share at december 31, 2018 was $35.46, compared to $34.01 at december 31, 2017.
risk management bb&t has a strong and consistent risk culture, based on established risk values, which promotes predictable and consistent performance within an environment of open communication and effective challenge. the strong culture influences all associates in the organization daily and helps them evaluate whether risks are acceptable or unacceptable while making decisions that balance quality, profitability and growth appropriately. bb&t's effective risk management framework establishes an environment which enables it to achieve superior performance relative to peers, ensures that bb&t is viewed among the safest of banks and assures the operational freedom to act on opportunities.
bb&t ensures that there is an appropriate return for the amount of risk taken, and that the expected return is in line with its strategic objectives and business plan. risk-taking activities are evaluated and prioritized to identify those that present attractive risk-adjusted returns while preserving asset value. bb&t only undertakes risks that are understood and can be managed effectively. by managing risk well, bb&t ensures sufficient capital is available to maintain and grow core business operations in a safe and sound manner.
•   first line of defense: risk management begins with the bus, the point at which risk is originated and where risks must be managed. business unit risk managers in the first line identify, assess, control and report their group's risk profile compared to its approved risk limits.
•   second line of defense: the rmo provides independent oversight and guidance of risk-taking across the enterprise. the rmo aggregates, integrates, and correlates risk information into a holistic picture of the corporation's risk profile and concentrations. the rmo establishes policies and limits and reports sources and amounts of risk to executive management and the board of directors.
•   third line of defense: audit services (bb&amp;t's internal audit function) evaluates the design and effectiveness of the risk management framework and its results. results are reported to executive management and the board of directors according to audit services policy.
beginning in 2019, bb&t bolstered its three line of defense model with the introduction of 2nd line of defense chief risk officers for each business segment and 1st line of defense business unit risk managers. the chief risk officers for each business segment serve as the second line of defense independent oversight function to aggregate, integrate, and correlate all risks that occur within the business segments and provide strategic recommendations to the cro. as the centralized first line risk function for each executive manager, the business unit risk manager ensures focus for the business unit pertaining to risk and controls by providing oversight and governance regarding its control environment.
risk committees       board of directors                                   executive management
1st line of defense   2nd line of defense   3rd line of defense business units        risk functions        audit services chief risk officer the cro leads the rmo, which designs, organizes and manages bb&t's risk management framework. the rmo is responsible for ensuring effective risk management oversight, measurement, monitoring, reporting and consistency. the cro has direct access to the board of directors and executive management. the cro is responsible for identifying and communicating in a timely manner to the ceo and the board of directors meaningful risks and significant instances when the rmo's assessment of risk differs from that of a bu, significant instances when a bu is not adhering to the risk governance framework, and bb&t's risk profile in relation to its risk appetite on at least a quarterly basis. in the event that the cro and ceo's assessment of risk were to differ or if the ceo were to not adhere to the risk management framework, the cro would have the responsibility to report such matters to the board of directors.
the executive management-led enterprise risk committees provide oversight of the first and second lines of defense and communicate risk appetite and values to the rmo. the cro and the enterprise risk committees approve policies, set risk limits and tolerances and monitor results.
the rmc, crmc, ormc, croc, mrlcc and ccrc are the enterprise risk committees and provide oversight of the risks as described in the common risk language. there is executive management representation in all six committees.
the risk management framework is composed of specialized risk functions focused on specific types of risk. the mrlcc, crmc, croc, ormc and ccrc provide oversight of market, liquidity, capital, credit, compliance, and operational risk while rmc provides a fully integrated view of all material risks across the company. the rmc provides oversight of all risks and its purpose is to review bb&t's aggregate risk exposure, evaluate risk appetite, and evaluate risks not reviewed by other risk committees.
the rmc is responsible for taking a broad view of risk, incorporating information from all risk functions. this combination of broad and specific focus provides the most effective framework for the management of risk. the rmc is chaired by the cro and its membership includes all members of executive management, the general auditor (ex officio) and senior leaders from financial management, the rmo and other areas.
the principal types of inherent risk include compliance, credit, liquidity, market, operational, reputation and strategic risks.
compliance risk compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures or ethical standards. this risk exposes bb&t to fines, civil money penalties, payment of damages and the voiding of contracts. compliance risk can result in diminished reputation, reduced franchise or enterprise value, limited business opportunities and lessened expansion potential.
credit risk credit risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from the default, inability or unwillingness of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty to meet the terms of any financial obligation with bb&t or otherwise perform as agreed. credit risk exists in all activities where success depends on the performance of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty. credit risk arises when bb&t funds are extended, committed, invested, or otherwise exposed through actual or implied contractual agreements, whether on or off balance sheet. credit risk also occurs when the credit quality of an issuer whose securities or other instruments the bank holds deteriorates.
bb&t has established the following general practices to manage credit risk:
•   limiting the amount of credit that individual lenders may extend to a borrower;
•   establishing a process for credit approval accountability;
•   careful initial underwriting and analysis of borrower, transaction, market and collateral risks;
•   ongoing servicing and monitoring of individual loans and lending relationships;
•   continuous monitoring of the portfolio, market dynamics and the economy; and
•   periodically reevaluating the bank's strategy and overall exposure as economic, market and other relevant conditions change.
the following discussion presents the principal types of lending conducted by bb&t and describes the underwriting procedures and overall risk management of bb&t's lending function.
underwriting approach the loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk; therefore, proper loan underwriting is critical to bb&t's long-term financial success. bb&t's underwriting approach is designed to define acceptable combinations of specific risk-mitigating features that ensure credit relationships conform to bb&t's risk philosophy. provided below is a summary of the most significant underwriting criteria used to evaluate new loans and loan renewals:
•   cash flow and debt service coverage-cash flow adequacy is a necessary condition of creditworthiness, meaning that loans must either be clearly supported by a borrower's cash flow or, if not, must be justified by secondary repayment sources.
•   secondary sources of repayment-alternative repayment funds are a significant risk-mitigating factor as long as they are liquid, can be easily accessed and provide adequate resources to supplement the primary cash flow source.
•   value of any underlying collateral-loans are generally secured by the asset being financed. because an analysis of the primary and secondary sources of repayment is the most important factor, collateral, unless it is liquid, does not justify loans that cannot be serviced by the borrower's normal cash flows.
•   overall creditworthiness of the customer, taking into account the customer's relationships, both past and current, with bb&amp;t and other lenders-bb&amp;t's success depends on building lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with clients, which involves assessing their financial position and background.
•   level of equity invested in the transaction-in general, borrowers are required to contribute or invest a portion of their own funds prior to any loan advances.
commercial loan and lease portfolio the commercial loan and lease portfolio represents the largest category of the company's total loan portfolio. cb-commercial generally targets small-to-middle market businesses with sales of $250 million or less, while bb&t's corporate banking group provides lending solutions to large corporate clients. the commercial loan and lease portfolio consists of dealer-based financing of equipment for small businesses, commercial equipment leasing and finance, and full-service commercial mortgage banking. bb&t offers these services to bank clients as well as nonbank clients within and outside bb&t's primary geographic market area.
in accordance with the company's lending policy, each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process, which incorporates bb&t's underwriting approach, procedures and evaluations described above. commercial loans are typically priced with an interest rate tied to market indices, such as the prime rate or libor. commercial loans are individually monitored and reviewed for any possible deterioration in the ability of the client to repay the loan. approximately 86.4% of bb&t's commercial loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventories and other types of collateral.
residential mortgage loan portfolio branch bank offers various types of fixed and adjustable-rate loans for the purpose of constructing, purchasing or refinancing residential properties. bb&t primarily originates conforming mortgage loans and higher quality jumbo and construction-to-permanent loans for owner-occupied properties. conforming loans are loans that are underwritten in accordance with the underwriting standards set forth by fnma and fhlmc. they are generally collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate, typically have loan-to-collateral value ratios of 80% or less at origination, and are made to borrowers in good credit standing.
risks associated with the mortgage lending function include interest rate risk, which is mitigated through the sale of a substantial portion of conforming fixed-rate loans in the secondary mortgage market, and an effective msr hedging process. borrower risk is lessened through rigorous underwriting procedures and mortgage insurance. the right to service the loans and receive servicing income is generally retained when conforming loans are sold. management believes that the retention of mortgage servicing is a relationship driver in retail banking and a part of management's strategy to establish profitable long-term customer relationships and offer high quality client service. bb&t also purchases residential mortgage loans from correspondent originators. the loans purchased from third-party originators are subject to the same underwriting and risk-management criteria as loans originated internally.
direct loan portfolio the direct loan portfolio primarily consists of a wide variety of loan products offered through bb&t's branch network. various types of secured and unsecured loans are marketed to qualifying existing clients and to other creditworthy candidates in bb&t's market area. the vast majority of direct loans are revolving home equity lines of credit secured by first or second liens on residential real estate. direct loans are subject to rigorous lending policies and procedures and are underwritten with note amounts and credit limits that ensure consistency with the company's risk philosophy.
53 bb&t corporation indirect loan portfolio the indirect portfolio primarily includes secured indirect installment loans to consumers for the purchase of new and used automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles. the indirect portfolio also includes nonprime and near prime automobile finance. such loans are originated through approved franchised and independent dealers throughout the bb&t market area. these loans are relatively homogeneous and no single loan is individually significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. indirect loans are subject to rigorous lending policies and procedures and are underwritten with note amounts and credit limits that ensure consistency with the company's risk philosophy. in addition to its normal underwriting due diligence, bb&t uses application systems and "scoring systems" to help underwrite and manage the credit risk in its indirect portfolio.
revolving credit loan portfolio the revolving credit portfolio consists of the outstanding balances on credit cards and bb&t's checking account overdraft protection product, constant credit. bb&t markets credit cards to its existing banking client base and does not solicit cardholders through nationwide programs or other forms of mass marketing. such balances are generally unsecured and actively managed.
pci the pci balance includes loans acquired with credit deterioration subsequent to origination as well as loans that were formerly covered by loss sharing agreements. refer to "note 3. loans and acl" for additional information.
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital that bb&t will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding (funding liquidity risk), or that it cannot easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions (market liquidity risk).
market risk market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from changes in the market value of portfolios, securities, or other financial instruments. market risk results from changes in the level, volatility or correlations among financial market rates or prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices or other relevant rates or prices.
interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows (re-pricing risk); from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest-related options embedded in bank products (options risk).
for additional information concerning bb&t's management of market risk, see the "market risk management" section of "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
operational risk operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. this definition includes legal risk, which is the risk of loss arising from defective transactions, litigation or claims made, or the failure to adequately protect company-owned assets.
cybersecurity in recent years, cybersecurity has gained prominence within the financial services industry due to increases in the quantity and sophistication of cyber attacks, which include significant distributed denial-of-service and credential validation attacks, malicious code and viruses and attempts to breach the security of systems, which, in certain instances, have resulted in unauthorized access to customer account data.
bb&t has a number of complex information systems used for a variety of functions by clients, associates and vendors. in addition, third parties with which bb&t does business or that facilitate business activities (e.g., vendors, exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories and financial intermediaries) could also be sources of cybersecurity risk to bb&t, including with respect to breakdowns or failures of their systems, misconduct by the employees of such parties, or cyber attacks which could affect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the product or service they provide to bb&t.
as a fhc, bb&t must adhere to the security requirements and expectations of the applicable regulatory agencies, which include requirements related to data privacy, systems availability and business continuity planning, among others. the regulatory agencies have established guidelines for the responsibilities of the board of directors and senior management, which include establishing policy, appointing and training personnel, implementing review and testing functions and ensuring an appropriate frequency of updates.
the board of directors is responsible for the oversight of cybersecurity risk. the dts src is responsible for technology oversight, including monitoring and reporting on technical risks. the information security committee is a sub-committee to the dts src, and helps set information security strategy, including understanding and prioritizing information security capabilities and associated risks. corporate information security is responsible for day-to-day cybersecurity operations. various reports on cybersecurity are provided to executive management and a quarterly update is provided to the risk committee or the full board of directors on a rotating basis. additionally, corporate information security provides an information security annual report, which includes cybersecurity risk assessments, to the board of directors.
as a complement to the overall cybersecurity infrastructure, bb&t has multilayered defenses pertaining to cyberthreat identification, detection, protection, response and recovery. bb&t promotes data protection awareness and accountability through robust training for our associates, both formally through mandatory courses and informally through written communications and other updates. additionally, bb&t focuses on building our cybersecurity organization with advanced capabilities and highly skilled talent to help mitigate those risks. internal policies and procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks. further, bb&t provides data protection guidance to our clients.
bb&t uses third party services as part of its cybersecurity framework, and any such third parties are required to comply with bb&t's policies regarding information security and confidentiality. bb&t also uses third party groups to assess and supplement the company's cybersecurity needs.
although cyber attacks have not resulted in any material disruption to bb&t's operations or harm to its clients and have not had a material adverse effect on bb&t's results of operations, there can be no assurance that bb&t will not suffer such disruptions, losses or other consequences in the future.
model risk management model risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. bb&t uses models for many purposes, including the valuation of financial positions and the measurement of risk. valuation models are used to value certain financial instruments for which quoted prices may not be readily available. valuation models are also used as inputs for var, regulatory capital, stress testing and the acl. models are owned by the applicable bus, who are responsible for the development, implementation and use of their models. oversight of these functions is performed by the mrm, which is a component of the rmo. once models have been approved, model owners are responsible for the maintenance of an appropriate operating environment and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on a recurring basis. models are updated in response to changes in portfolio composition, industry and economic conditions, technological capabilities and other developments.
the mrm utilizes internal validation analysts and managers with skill sets in predictive modeling to perform detailed reviews of model development, implementation and conceptual soundness. on certain occasions, the mrm will also engage external parties to assist with validation efforts. the mrm maintains documented quality assurance procedures that are used to confirm that validation analysts have completed the necessary field work in an auditable and complete fashion. the mrm tracks issues that have been identified by validation analysts and engages with model owners to ensure their timely remediation. mrm presents model limitations and risks to management and the board of directors via model validation reports and regular meetings with the ormc.
reputation risk reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, enterprise value, the bb&t brand, and public confidence arising from negative publicity or public opinion, whether real or perceived, regarding bb&t's business practices, products, services, transactions, or other activities undertaken by bb&t, its representatives, or its partners. a negative reputation may impair bb&t's relationship with clients, associates, communities or shareholders, and it is often a residual risk that arises when other risks are not managed properly.
strategic risk strategic risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, enterprise value and the achievement of bb&t's vision, mission, purpose and business objectives consistent with its values that arises from bb&t's business strategy or potentially adverse business decisions, improper or ineffective implementation of business decisions or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment. strategic risk is a function of bb&t's strategic goals, business strategies, resources and quality of implementation. the responsibility for managing this risk rests with the board of directors, executive management and the senior leadership team.
55 bb&t corporation market risk management the effective management of market risk is essential to achieving bb&t's strategic financial objectives. as a financial institution, bb&t's most significant market risk exposure is interest rate risk in its balance sheet; however, market risk also includes product liquidity risk, price risk and volatility risk in bb&t's bus. the primary objectives of market risk management are to minimize any adverse effect that changes in market risk factors may have on net interest income, net income and capital and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets recorded at fair value. at bb&t, market risk management also includes the enterprise-wide ipv function.
bb&t actively manages market risk associated with asset and liability portfolios with a focus on the strategic pricing of asset and liability accounts and management of appropriate maturity mixes of assets and liabilities. the goal of these activities is the development of appropriate maturity and repricing opportunities in bb&t's portfolios of assets and liabilities that will produce reasonably consistent net interest income during periods of changing interest rates. these portfolios are analyzed for proper fixed-rate and variable-rate mixes under various interest rate scenarios.
the asset/liability management process is designed to achieve relatively stable nim and assure liquidity by coordinating the volumes, maturities or repricing opportunities of earning assets, deposits and borrowed funds. among other things, this process gives consideration to prepayment trends related to securities, loans and leases and certain deposits that have no stated maturity. prepayment assumptions are developed using a combination of market data and internal historical prepayment experience for residential mortgage-related loans and securities, and internal historical prepayment experience for client deposits with no stated maturity and loans that are not residential mortgage related. these assumptions are subject to monthly review and adjustment, and are modified as deemed necessary to reflect changes in interest rates relative to the reference rate of the underlying assets or liabilities. on a monthly basis, bb&t evaluates the accuracy of its simulation model, which includes an evaluation of its prepayment assumptions, to ensure that all significant assumptions inherent in the model appropriately reflect changes in the interest rate environment and related trends in prepayment activity. it is the responsibility of the mrlcc to determine and achieve the most appropriate volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as to ensure an adequate level of liquidity and capital, within the context of corporate performance goals. the mrlcc also sets policy guidelines and establishes long-term strategies with respect to interest rate risk exposure and liquidity. the mrlcc meets regularly to review bb&t's interest rate risk and liquidity positions in relation to present and prospective market and business conditions, and adopts funding and balance sheet management strategies that are intended to ensure that the potential impacts on earnings and liquidity as a result of fluctuations in interest rates are within acceptable tolerance guidelines.
bb&t uses derivatives primarily to manage economic risk related to securities, commercial loans, msrs and mortgage banking operations, long-term debt and other funding sources. bb&t also uses derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients. as of december 31, 2018, bb&t had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling $67.7 billion, with a net fair value loss of $1 million. see "note 17. derivative financial instruments" for additional disclosures.
the majority of bb&t's assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and, therefore, differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. fluctuations in interest rates and actions of the frb to regulate the availability and cost of credit have a greater effect on a financial institution's profitability than do the effects of higher costs for goods and services. through its balance sheet management function, which is monitored by the mrlcc, management believes that bb&t is positioned to respond to changing needs for liquidity, changes in interest rates and inflationary trends.
management uses the simulation to measure the sensitivity of projected earnings to changes in interest rates. the simulation projects net interest income and interest rate risk for a rolling two-year period of time. the simulation takes into account the current contractual agreements that bb&t has made with its customers on deposits, borrowings, loans, investments and commitments to enter into those transactions. furthermore, the simulation considers the impact of expected customer behavior. management monitors bb&t's interest sensitivity by means of a model that incorporates the current volumes, average rates earned and paid, and scheduled maturities and payments of asset and liability portfolios, together with multiple scenarios that include projected prepayments, repricing opportunities and anticipated volume growth. using this information, the model projects earnings based on projected portfolio balances under multiple interest rate scenarios. this level of detail is needed to simulate the effect that changes in interest rates and portfolio balances may have on the earnings of bb&t. this method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the process, but management believes that it provides a better illustration of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates than other analyses such as static or dynamic gap. in addition to the simulation, bb&t uses eve analysis to focus on projected changes in asset and liability values given potential changes in interest rates. this measure also allows bb&t to analyze interest rate risk that falls outside the analysis window contained in the simulation. the eve model is a discounted cash flow of the portfolio of assets, liabilities, and derivative instruments. the difference in the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities is defined as the economic value of equity.
the asset/liability management process requires a number of key assumptions. management determines the most likely outlook for the economy and interest rates by analyzing external factors, including published economic projections and data, the effects of likely monetary and fiscal policies, as well as any enacted or prospective regulatory changes. bb&t's current and prospective liquidity position, current balance sheet volumes and projected growth, accessibility of funds for short-term needs and capital maintenance are also considered. this data is combined with various interest rate scenarios to provide management with the information necessary to analyze interest sensitivity and to aid in the development of strategies to reach performance goals.
the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next twelve months assuming a gradual change in interest rates as described below. key assumptions in the preparation of the table include prepayment speeds of mortgage-related and other assets, cash flows and maturities of derivative financial instruments, loan volumes and pricing, deposit beta, customer preferences and capital plans. the resulting change in net interest income reflects the level of interest rate sensitivity that income has in relation to the investment, loan and deposit portfolios.

if a parallel rate change of 200 basis points cannot be modeled due to a low level of rates, a proportional limit applies, and the maximum negative impact on net interest income is adjusted on a proportional basis. regardless of the proportional limit, the negative risk exposure limit will be the greater of the 4% or the proportional limit.
management has also established a maximum negative impact on net interest income of 4% for an immediate 100 basis points parallel change in rates and 8% for an immediate 200 basis points parallel change in rates. these "interest rate shock" limits are designed to create an outer band of acceptable risk based upon a significant and immediate change in rates.
management has temporarily suspended its interest rate exposure limits to declining interest rates. although, the federal reserve has raised rates nine times beginning in december 2015, competitive pressure on deposit rates was slow to materialize. as a result, asset repricing in excess of liability repricing has caused the measured exposure to declining rates to increase. management closely monitors its interest rate risk position.
management considers how the balance sheet and interest rate risk position could be impacted by changes in balance sheet mix. liquidity in the banking industry has been very strong during the current economic cycle. much of this liquidity increase has been due to a significant increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. consistent with the industry, branch bank has seen a significant increase in this funding source. the behavior of these deposits is one of the most important assumptions used in determining the interest rate risk position of bb&t. a loss of these deposits in the future would reduce the asset sensitivity of bb&t's balance sheet as the company increases interest-bearing funds to offset the loss of this advantageous funding source.
beta represents the correlation between overall market interest rates and the rates paid by bb&t on interest-bearing deposits. bb&t applies an average beta of approximately 55% to its non-maturity interest-bearing deposit accounts for determining its interest rate sensitivity. non-maturity interest-bearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts, savings accounts and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity. the actual deposit beta on non-maturity interest-bearing deposits has been less than 27% since rates began to rise in december 2015. however, bb&t expects the beta to increase as rates continue to rise as evidenced by the 39% beta on interest bearing-deposits related to the september 2018 federal funds rate increase. bb&t regularly conducts sensitivity on other key variables to determine the impact they could have on the interest rate risk position. this allows bb&t to evaluate the likely impact on its balance sheet management strategies due to a more extreme variation in a key assumption than expected.
57 bb&t corporation the following table shows the results of bb&t's interest-rate sensitivity position assuming the loss of demand deposits and an associated increase in managed rate deposits under various scenarios. for purposes of this analysis, bb&t modeled the incremental beta for the replacement of the lost demand deposits at 100%.

if rates increased 200 basis points, bb&t could absorb the loss of $8.9 billion, or 16.7%, of noninterest-bearing deposits and replace them with managed rate deposits with a beta of 100% before becoming neutral to interest rate changes.
the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on eve. key assumptions in the preparation of the table include prepayment speeds of mortgage-related and other assets, cash flows and maturities of derivative financial instruments, loan volumes and pricing and deposit sensitivity.

liquidity liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs, including deposit withdrawals, timely repayment of borrowings and other liabilities, and funding of loan commitments. in addition to the level of liquid assets, such as cash, cash equivalents and afs securities, many other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs, including access to a variety of funding sources, maintaining borrowing capacity in national money markets, growing core deposits, the repayment of loans and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale.
bb&t monitors the ability to meet customer demand for funds under both normal and stressed market conditions. in considering its liquidity position, management evaluates bb&t's funding mix based on client core funding, client rate-sensitive funding and national markets funding. in addition, management also evaluates exposure to rate-sensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less. management also measures liquidity needs against 30 days of stressed cash outflows for branch bank and bb&t. to ensure a strong liquidity position, management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unpledged securities. bb&t follows the frb's enhanced prudential standards for purposes of determining the liquid asset buffer. bb&t's policy is to use the greater of either 5% of total assets or a range of projected net cash outflows over a 30 day period. as of december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, bb&t's liquid asset buffer was 14.7% and 14.3%, respectively, of total assets.
bb&t is considered to be a "modified lcr" holding company. bb&t would be subject to full lcr requirements if its assets were to increase above $250 billion or if it were to be considered internationally active. in october 2018, the federal banking agencies proposed changes to applicability thresholds for liquidity requirements that would amend the full lcr such that bhc's with assets between $250 billion and $700 billion, and less than $75 billion in certain other risk related exposures, would be subject to a reduced full lcr. see additional disclosures in the "regulatory considerations" section.
bb&t produces lcr calculations to effectively manage the position of high-quality liquid assets and the balance sheet deposit mix to optimize bb&t's liquidity position. bb&t's modified lcr was approximately 126% at december 31, 2018, compared to the regulatory minimum for such entities of 100%, which puts bb&t in full compliance with the rule. the lcr can experience volatility due to issues like maturing debt rolling into the 30 day measurement period, or client inflows and outflows. the daily change in bb&t's modified lcr averaged less than 2% during 2018 with a maximum change of approximately 12%.
bb&t routinely evaluates the impact of becoming subject to the full lcr requirement. this includes an evaluation of the changes to the balance sheet and investment strategy that would be necessary to comply with the requirement. management does not currently expect the required changes to have a material impact on bb&t's financial condition or results of operations.
parent company the purpose of the parent company is to serve as the primary source of capital for the operating subsidiaries, with assets primarily consisting of cash on deposit with branch bank, equity investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, accounts receivable from subsidiaries, and other miscellaneous assets. the principal obligations of the parent company are payments on long-term debt. the main sources of funds for the parent company are dividends and management fees from subsidiary, repayments of advances to subsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance of equity and long-term debt. the primary uses of funds by the parent company are for investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders, retirement of common stock and payments on long-term debt.
the primary source of funds used for parent company cash requirements was dividends received from subsidiaries. see "note 15. parent company financial information" for additional information regarding dividends from subsidiaries and debt transactions.
liquidity at the parent company is more susceptible to market disruptions. bb&t prudently manages cash levels at the parent company to cover a minimum of one year of projected cash outflows which includes unfunded external commitments, debt service, common and preferred dividends and scheduled debt maturities without the benefit of any new cash infusions. generally, bb&t maintains a significant buffer above the projected one year of cash outflows. in determining the buffer, bb&t considers cash requirements for common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates, being a source of strength to its banking subsidiary and being able to withstand sustained market disruptions that could limit access to the capital markets. at december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, the parent company had 28 months and 29 months, respectively, of cash on hand to satisfy projected contractual cash outflows, and 19 months and 23 months, respectively, taking into account common stock dividends.
branch bank bb&t carefully manages liquidity risk at branch bank. branch bank's primary source of funding is customer deposits. continued access to customer deposits is highly dependent on the confidence the public has in the stability of branch bank and its ability to return funds to the client when requested. bb&t maintains a strong focus on its reputation in the market to ensure continued access to client deposits. bb&t integrates its risk appetite into its overall risk management framework to ensure branch bank does not exceed its risk tolerance through its lending and other risk taking functions and thus risk becoming undercapitalized. bb&t believes that sufficient capital is paramount to maintaining the confidence of its depositors and other funds providers. bb&t has extensive capital management processes in place to ensure it maintains sufficient capital to absorb losses and maintain a highly capitalized position that will instill confidence in branch bank and allow continued access to deposits and other funding sources. branch bank monitors many liquidity metrics including funding concentrations, diversification, maturity distribution, contingent funding needs and ability to meet liquidity requirements under times of stress.
branch bank has several major sources of funding to meet its liquidity requirements, including access to capital markets through issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes and institutional cds, access to the fhlb system, dealer repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements with commercial clients, access to the overnight and term federal funds markets, use of a cayman branch facility, access to retail brokered cds and a borrower in custody program with the frb for the discount window. at december 31, 2018, branch bank has approximately $78.9 billion of secured borrowing capacity, which represents approximately 5.2 times the amount of one year wholesale funding maturities.
the ability to raise funding at competitive prices is affected by the rating agencies' views of the parent company's and branch bank's credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings. management meets with the rating agencies on a regular basis to discuss current outlooks. the ratings for bb&t and branch bank by the major rating agencies are detailed in the table below:

bb&t and branch bank have contingency funding plans designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet their ongoing obligations and commitments, particularly in the event of a liquidity contraction. these plans are designed to examine and quantify the organization's liquidity under various "stress" scenarios. additionally, the plans provide a framework for management and other critical personnel to follow in the event of a liquidity contraction or in anticipation of such an event. the plans address authority for activation and decision making, liquidity options and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of a liquidity contraction. the liquidity options available to management could include seeking secured funding, asset sales, and under the most extreme scenarios, curtailing new loan originations.
management believes current sources of liquidity are adequate to meet bb&t's current requirements and plans for continued growth. see "note 4. premises and equipment," "note 8. long-term debt" and "note 13. commitments and contingencies" for additional information regarding outstanding balances of sources of liquidity and contractual commitments and obligations.

(4)   although technically unfunded plans, rabbi trusts and insurance policies on the lives of certain of the covered employees are available to finance future benefit plan payments.
bb&t's commitments include investments in affordable housing projects throughout its market area and private equity funds. refer to "note 1. basis of presentation" and "note 13. commitments and contingencies" for further discussion of these commitments.
in addition, bb&t enters into derivative contracts to manage various financial risks. a derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows, and therefore its value, by reference to an underlying instrument, index or referenced interest rate. derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date. derivative contracts are written in amounts referred to as notional amounts, which only provide the basis for calculating payments between counterparties and are not a measure of financial risk. therefore, the derivative liabilities recorded on the balance sheet as of december 31, 2018 do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts. further discussion of derivative instruments is included in "note 1. basis of presentation" and "note 17. derivative financial instruments."
in the ordinary course of business, bb&t indemnifies its officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities arising from litigation. bb&t also issues standard representation and warranties in underwriting agreements, merger and acquisition agreements, loan sales, brokerage activities and other similar arrangements. counterparties in many of these indemnifications provide similar indemnifications to bb&t. although these agreements often do not specify limitations, bb&t does not believe that any payments related to these guarantees would materially change the financial condition or results of operations of bb&t.
bb&t holds public funds in certain states that do not require 100% collateralization on public fund bank deposits. in these states, should the failure of another public fund depository institution result in a loss for the public entity, the resulting uncollateralized deposit shortfall would have to be absorbed on a pro-rata basis (based upon the public deposits held by each bank within the respective state) by the remaining financial institutions holding public funds in that state. bb&t monitors deposits levels relative to the total public deposits held by all depository institutions within these states.
as a member of the fhlb, bb&t is required to maintain a minimum investment in capital stock. the board of directors of the fhlb can increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to meet its own regulatory capital requirements. any increase in the minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges requires the approval of the federal housing finance agency. because the extent of any obligation to increase bb&t's investment in the fhlb depends entirely upon the occurrence of a future event, potential future payments to the fhlb are not determinable.
in the normal course of business, bb&t is also a party to financial instruments to meet the financing needs of clients and to mitigate exposure to certain risks. such financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and certain contractual agreements, including standby letters of credit and financial guarantee arrangements. further discussion of bb&t's commitments is included in "note 13. commitments and contingencies" and "note 16. fair value disclosures."
capital the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis. bb&t's principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support bb&t's risk profile consistent with the board-approved risk appetite, provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve optimal credit ratings for bb&t and its subsidiaries and provide a competitive return to shareholders. risk-based capital ratios, which include cet1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets.
management regularly monitors the capital position of bb&t on both a consolidated and bank-level basis. in this regard, management's overriding policy is to maintain capital at levels that are in excess of internal capital targets, which are above the regulatory "well capitalized" levels. management has implemented stressed capital ratio minimum targets to evaluate whether capital ratios calculated with planned capital actions are likely to remain above minimums specified by the frb for the annual ccar. breaches of stressed minimum targets prompt a review of the planned capital actions included in bb&t's capital plan.

(1)   bb&amp;t's goal is to maintain capital levels above all regulatory minimums.
61 bb&t corporation while nonrecurring events or management decisions may result in the company temporarily falling below its operating minimum guidelines for one or more of these ratios, it is management's intent to return to these targeted operating minimums within a reasonable period of time through capital planning. such temporary decreases below the operating minimums shown above are not considered an infringement of bb&t's overall capital policy, provided a return above the minimums is forecasted to occur within a reasonable time period.
payments of cash dividends and repurchases of common shares are the methods used to manage any excess capital generated. in addition, management closely monitors the parent company's double leverage ratio (investments in subsidiaries as a percentage of shareholders' equity). the active management of the subsidiaries' equity capital, as described above, is the process used to manage this important driver of parent company liquidity and is a key element in the management of bb&t's capital position.
management intends to maintain capital at branch bank at levels that will result in classification as "well-capitalized" for regulatory purposes. secondarily, it is management's intent to maintain branch bank's capital at levels that result in regulatory risk-based capital ratios that are generally comparable with peers of similar size, complexity and risk profile. if the capital levels of branch bank increase above these guidelines, excess capital may be transferred to the parent company in the form of special dividend payments, subject to regulatory and other operating considerations.
bb&t regularly performs stress testing on its capital levels and is required to periodically submit the company's capital plans to the banking regulators. the frb did not object to the company's 2018 capital plan. on february 5, 2019, the frb notified banks with less than $250 billion in assets that they will not need to participate in the 2019 supervisory stress test. however, bb&t may need to provide additional information as a result of the pending merger with suntrust. following the completion of the merger of equals with suntrust, management's capital deployment plan in order of preference is to focus on 1) organic growth, 2) dividends and 3) strategic opportunities and/or share repurchases depending on opportunities in the marketplace and bb&t's interest and ability to proceed with acquisitions. bb&t has suspended share repurchases as a result of the pending merger of equals with suntrust.

fourth quarter results consolidated net income available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaling $754 million was up 22.8% compared to $614 million earned during the same period in 2017. on a diluted per common share basis, earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 were $0.97, up 26.0% compared to $0.77 for the same period in 2017. bb&t's results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2018 produced an annualized return on average assets of 1.43% and an annualized return on average common shareholders' equity of 11.14%, compared to prior year ratios of 1.19% and 9.10%, respectively.
net interest margin was 3.49%, up six basis points compared to the earlier quarter. average earning assets increased $1.9 billion. the increase in average earnings assets reflects a $4.4 billion increase in average total loans and leases, partially offset by decreases of $1.5 billion and $977 million in average securities and other earning assets, respectively. average interest-bearing liabilities increased $1.9 billion compared to the earlier quarter. average long-term debt increased $849 million, while average short-term borrowings increased $637 million and average interest-bearing deposits increased $439 million. the annualized yield on the total loan portfolio for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 4.96%, up 46 basis points compared to the earlier quarter, reflecting the impact of rate increases. the annualized taxable-equivalent yield on the average securities portfolio was 2.53%, up 11 basis points compared to the earlier period.
63 bb&t corporation the average annualized cost of total deposits was 0.52%, up 26 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. the average annualized cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.78%, up 38 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. the average annualized rate on long-term debt was 3.19%, up 83 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. the average annualized rate on short-term borrowings was 2.18%, up 105 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. the higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities also reflect the impact of rate increases.
the provision for credit losses was $146 million compared to $138 million in the earlier quarter. net charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $143 million compared to $130 million for the earlier quarter.
noninterest income was $1.2 billion, an increase of $10 million from the earlier quarter. excluding a $37 million decrease in income related to assets for certain post-employment benefits, which is primarily offset by lower personnel expense, noninterest income increased $47 million.
noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $1.8 billion, down $71 million compared to the earlier quarter. the current quarter includes $28 million of additional operating expenses associated with the regions insurance acquisition and an increase of $54 million in merger-related and restructuring charges. the earlier quarter included $136 million of expenses due to actions taken in connection with the passage of tax reform legislation. noninterest expenses were lower $37 million related to assets for certain post-employment benefits, which is primarily offset by lower noninterest income. excluding these items, noninterest expense was up $20 million compared to the earlier quarter.
the provision for income taxes was $205 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $209 million for the earlier quarter. this produced an effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 of 20.3%, compared to 23.9% for the earlier quarter. the provision for income taxes for the current quarter reflects the new lower federal tax rate while the earlier quarter included a net tax benefit of $43 million related to the impact of tax reform.

critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of bb&t are in accordance with gaap and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. the financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the consolidated financial position and/or consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. understanding bb&t's accounting policies is fundamental to understanding the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. accordingly, bb&t's significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in detail in "note 1. basis of presentation."
the following is a summary of bb&t's critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions and judgments. these critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a periodic basis.
acl bb&t's policy is to maintain an alll and a rufc that represent management's best estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date. estimates for loan and lease losses are determined by analyzing historical loan and lease losses, historical loan and lease migration to charge-off experience, current trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, expected cash flows on purchased loans, current assessment of impaired loans and leases, the results of regulatory examinations and changes in the size, composition and risk assessment of the loan and lease portfolio. as part of this process, bb&t develops a series of loss estimate factors, which are modeled projections of the frequency and severity of losses. these loss estimate factors are based on historical loss experience, economic and political environmental considerations and any other data that management believes will provide evidence about the collectability of outstanding loan and lease amounts. the following table summarizes the loss estimate factors used to determine the alll:
loss estimate factor   description loss frequency         indicates the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan loss severity          indicates the amount of estimated loss at the time of default bb&t corporation 64
for collectively evaluated loans, the alll is determined by multiplying the loan exposure estimated at the time of default by the loss frequency and loss severity factors. for individually evaluated loans, the alll is determined through review of data specific to the borrower. for tdrs, default expectations and estimated slower prepayment speeds that are specific to each of the restructured loan populations are incorporated in the determination of the alll. also included in management's estimates for loan and lease losses are considerations with respect to the impact of current economic events, the outcomes of which are uncertain. these events may include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in overall interest rates, political conditions, legislation that may directly or indirectly affect the banking industry and economic conditions affecting specific geographical areas and industries in which bb&t conducts business.
the methodology used to determine an estimate for the rufc is inherently similar to the methodology used in calculating the alll adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at the time of funding. a detailed discussion of the methodology used in determining the alll and the rufc is included in "note 1. basis of presentation."
fair value of financial instruments the vast majority of assets and liabilities carried at fair value are based on either quoted market prices or market prices for similar instruments. see "note 16. fair value disclosures" for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments.
securities bb&t generally utilizes a third-party pricing service in determining the fair value of its afs and trading securities. fair value measurements are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads and broker quotes. management performs procedures to evaluate the fair values provided by the third-party service provider. these procedures, which are performed independent of the responsible bu, include comparison of pricing information received from the third party pricing service to other third party pricing sources, review of additional information provided by the third party pricing service and other third party sources for selected securities and back-testing to compare the price realized on security sales to the daily pricing information received from the third party pricing service. the ipv committee, which provides oversight to bb&t's enterprise-wide ipv function, is responsible for oversight of the comparison of pricing information received from the third party pricing service to other third party pricing sources, approving tolerance limits determined by ipv for price comparison exceptions, reviewing significant changes to pricing and valuation policies and reviewing and approving the pricing decisions made on any illiquid and hard-to-price securities. when market observable data is not available, which generally occurs due to the lack of liquidity for certain securities, the valuation of the security is subjective and may involve substantial judgment by management.
bb&t periodically reviews afs securities with an unrealized loss. an unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. the purpose of the review is to consider the length of time and the extent to which the market value of a security has been below its amortized cost. the primary factors bb&t considers in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary are long-term expectations and recent experience regarding principal and interest payments and bb&t's intent to sell and whether it is more likely than not that the company would be required to sell those securities before the anticipated recovery of the amortized cost basis.
msrs bb&t's primary class of msrs for which it separately manages the economic risks relates to residential mortgages. residential msrs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. while sales of msrs do occur, the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available. accordingly, bb&t estimates the fair value of residential msrs using a stochastic oas valuation model to project residential msr cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios, which are then discounted at risk-adjusted rates. the oas model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenue, costs to service and other economic factors. bb&t reassesses and periodically adjusts the underlying inputs and assumptions in the oas model to reflect market conditions and assumptions that a market participant would consider in valuing the residential msr asset.
fair value estimates and assumptions are compared to industry surveys, recent market activity, actual portfolio experience and, when available, observable market data. due to the nature of the valuation inputs, residential msrs are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. the value of residential msrs is significantly affected by mortgage interest rates available in the marketplace, which influence mortgage loan prepayment speeds. in general, during periods of declining interest rates, the value of msrs declines due to increasing prepayments attributable to increased mortgage-refinance activity. conversely, during periods of rising interest rates, the value of residential msrs generally increases due to reduced refinance activity. bb&t typically hedges against market value changes in the residential msrs. refer to "note 6. loan servicing" for quantitative disclosures reflecting the effect that changes in management's assumptions would have on the fair value of residential msrs.
65 bb&t corporation lhfs bb&t originates certain mortgage loans for sale to investors that are carried at fair value. the fair value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans. changes in the fair value are recorded as a component of mortgage banking income, while the related origination costs are recognized in noninterest expense when incurred. the changes in fair value are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the lhfs. bb&t uses various derivative instruments to mitigate the economic effect of changes in fair value of the underlying loans.
derivative assets and liabilities bb&t uses derivatives to manage various financial risks. bb&t mitigates credit risk by subjecting counterparties to credit reviews and approvals similar to those used in making loans and other extensions of credit. in addition, certain counterparties are required to provide collateral to bb&t when their unsecured loss positions exceed certain negotiated limits. the fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices and internal pricing models that use market observable data. the fair value of interest rate lock commitments, which are related to mortgage loan commitments, is based on quoted market prices adjusted for commitments that bb&t does not expect to fund and includes the value attributable to the net servicing fee.
intangible assets the acquisition method of accounting requires that acquired assets and liabilities are recorded at their fair values. this often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, which are inherently subjective. the amortization of definite-lived intangible assets is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received, which is also subjective. acquisitions also typically result in goodwill, which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair values of the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates. refer to "note 1. basis of presentation" for a description of the impairment testing process. management considers the sensitivity of the significant assumptions in its impairment analysis including consideration of a 10% change in estimated future cash flows or the discount rate for each reporting unit.
pension and postretirement benefit obligations bb&t offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to employees. calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions, which are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used. the discount rate assumption used to measure the postretirement benefit obligations is set by reference to a high-quality (aa-rated or higher) corporate bond yield curve and the individual characteristics of the plans such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations. management considered the sensitivity changes that the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate would have on pension expense. a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would result in additional pension expense of approximately $31 million for 2019, while a decrease of 100 basis points in the expected return on plan assets would result in an increase of approximately $60 million in pension expense for 2019. refer to "note 12. benefit plans" for disclosures related to the benefit plans.

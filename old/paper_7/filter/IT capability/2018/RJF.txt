raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis introduction the following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and financial condition. this md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. where "nm" is used in various percentage change computations, the computed percentage change has been determined to be not meaningful.
executive overview we operate as a financial holding company and bank holding company. results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to general economic conditions and, more specifically, to the direction of the u.s. equity and fixed income markets, market volatility, corporate and mortgage lending markets and commercial and residential credit trends.  overall market conditions, interest rates, economic, political and regulatory trends, and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control.  these factors affect the financial decisions made by market participants who include investors, borrowers, and competitors, impacting their level of participation in the financial markets. these factors also impact the level of investment banking activity as well as trading profits and asset valuations, which ultimately affect our business results.
year ended september 30, 2018 compared with the year ended september 30, 2017
during the year ended september 30, 2018, earnings were negatively affected by $105 million due to the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act ("tax act"), primarily related to the remeasurement of u.s. deferred tax assets at a lower enacted federal corporate tax rate. excluding the impact of the tax act and $4 million of acquisition-related expenses, adjusted net income was $965 million (1), a 26% increase compared with adjusted net income of $768 million (1) in the prior year, which excluded expenses related to the jay peak matter, losses on the extinguishment of certain of our senior notes, and acquisition-related expenses. adjusted earnings per diluted share were $6.47 (1), a 24% increase compared with adjusted earnings per diluted share of $5.23 (1) in the prior year.
the increase in net revenues reflected significant growth in client assets, net interest income and account and service fees earned on balances in our rjbdp, and strong investment banking revenues. total client assets under administration reached $790.4 billion at september 30, 2018, a 14% increase, primarily attributable to strong financial advisor recruiting and retention, as well as equity market appreciation. partially offsetting the aforementioned revenue increases, institutional equity and fixed income commissions declined compared with the prior year, reflecting market-driven challenges.
non-interest expenses increased $526 million, or 10%. the increase primarily resulted from increased compensation, commissions and benefits expenses associated with the increase in net revenues, as well as increased staffing levels required to support our continued growth and regulatory compliance requirements. communications and information processing expenses also increased compared with the prior year as a result of our continued investment in technology infrastructure to support our growth. offsetting these increases was a decline in legal expenses, as the settlement of the jay peak matter had a $130 million impact on the prior year, and a decline related to our prior year loss on extinguishment of certain of our senior notes.
our effective tax rate was 34.8% for fiscal 2018, reflecting the impact of the tax act of $105 million, partially offset by a lower blended federal corporate statutory tax rate of 24.5%. excluding the impact of the tax act, our adjusted effective tax rate was 26.7% (1). we estimate our effective tax rate to be approximately 24%-25% for fiscal year 2019, reflecting the lower federal corporate statutory tax rate of 21% for the full year.  our future effective tax rate may be impacted positively or negatively by non-taxable items (such as the gains or losses earned on our company-owned life insurance policies and tax-exempt interest), non-deductible expenses (such as meals and entertainment and certain executive compensation) and vesting and exercises of equity compensation awards.  see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for further information on the tax act.
(1)   "adjusted net income" and "adjusted earnings per diluted share" are each non-gaap financial measures. please see the "reconciliation of gaap measures to non-gaap measures" in this item 2, for a reconciliation of our non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures, and for other important disclosures.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis a summary of our financial results by segment as compared to the prior year is as follows:
•   our pcg segment generated net revenues of $5.09 billion, a 15% increase, and pre-tax income of $576 million, an increase of 54% over the prior year, which was negatively impacted by $130 million of legal expenses related to the jay peak matter. the increase in net revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in securities commissions and fees, driven by increased fee-based assets resulting from higher equity markets and continued strong financial advisor recruiting and retention. the segment also benefited from an increase in account and service fees related to client cash balances in our rjbdp and higher net interest income. non-interest expenses increased $468 million, or 12%, primarily resulting from increases in compensation, commissions and benefits expenses and communications and information processing expenses, offset by a decrease in the aforementioned legal expenses.
•   our capital markets segment generated net revenues of $964 million, a 5% decrease over the prior year, and pre-tax income declined 36% to $91 million. the decrease in net revenues was primarily due to market-driven challenges and low levels of client activity, which led to decreases in institutional fixed income and equity commissions and net trading profits. investment banking revenues increased due to stronger merger &amp; acquisition activity, partially offset by lower equity underwriting revenues. non-interest expenses decreased slightly compared with the prior year.
•   our asset management segment generated a 34% increase in net revenues to $654 million, and pre-tax income increased 37% to $235 million. the increase in net revenues primarily reflected increases in advisory fees from managed programs and, to a lesser degree, non-discretionary asset-based administrative fees. financial assets under management increased 46% over the period year, aided by the acquisition of scout investments, inc. (the "scout group"), which added $27 billion of assets under management in november 2017. non-interest expenses increased $100 million, or 32%, primarily resulting from increased expenses related to the scout group acquisition and increased investment sub-advisory fees.
•   rj bank generated a 23% increase in net revenues to $727 million, while pre-tax income increased 20% to $492 million. the increase in net revenues resulted primarily from an increase in net interest income due to growth in interest-earning assets and an increase in net interest margin. non-interest expenses increased $52 million, or 28%, primarily reflecting higher affiliate deposit fees paid to pcg due to an increase in client accounts and an increase in compensation and benefits expenses.
•   our other segment reflected a pre-tax loss that was $87 million, a decline of 51% from the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in net interest expense, losses on the extinguishment of certain of our senior notes in the prior year, and lower acquisition-related expenses. the decline in net interest expense reflected a decrease in the outstanding balance and average interest rate of our senior notes payable, as well as an increase in interest income related to the increased interest rates earned on higher corporate cash balances.
year ended september 30, 2017 compared with the year ended september 30, 2016
during the year ended september 30, 2017, earnings were impacted negatively by the jay peak settlement, losses on the early extinguishment of certain of our senior notes and acquisition-related expenses. after excluding the impact of these expenses, which totaled $194 million, our adjusted net income was $768 million,(1) an increase of 35% compared with adjusted net income in the prior year. adjusted earnings per diluted share were $5.23,(1) a 33% increase compared with adjusted earnings per diluted share in the prior year.
net revenues increased in each of our four operating segments, including significant growth in pcg and asset management segments, which benefited from growth in client assets in fee-based accounts, and significant growth in rj bank due to an increase in average interest-earning assets and an increase in net interest margin. investment banking revenues in our capital markets segment were strong and were significantly higher than fiscal year 2016; however institutional sales commissions declined reflecting the low levels of market volatility. total client assets under administration reached $692.9 billion at september 30, 2017, a 15% increase, primarily attributable to strong financial advisor recruiting and retention results and equity market appreciation.
(1)   "adjusted net income" and "adjusted earnings per diluted share" are each non-gaap financial measures. please see the "reconciliation of gaap measures to non-gaap measures" in this item 2, for a reconciliation of our non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures, and for other important disclosures.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis non-interest expenses increased $850 million, or 19%. the increase primarily resulted from increased compensation, commissions and benefits expenses, primarily associated with increased revenues and income, as well as increased staffing levels required to support our continued growth, and increased regulatory and compliance requirements. we also had losses on the early extinguishment of certain senior notes and increased legal expenses during the year for the jay peak settlement.
our effective tax rate was 31.2% in the current year, down from the 33.9% for the prior year. the decrease in our effective tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily due to the favorable impact of the adoption of new stock compensation accounting guidance which had a favorable impact on our effective tax rate of 2.7% and our provision for taxes of $25 million (see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for additional information). also contributing to the decrease was a favorable impact of 1.7% due to the increase in the amount of nontaxable gains arising from the value of our company-owned life insurance policies as a result of an increase in equity market values, compared to a 1.1% favorable impact in the prior year.
a summary of our financial results by segment as compared to the prior year is as follows:
•   our private client group segment generated net revenues of $4.42 billion, a 22% increase, while pre-tax income increased 10% to $373 million. the increase in net revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in securities commissions and fees, driven by strong recruiting results, the acquisitions of alex. brown and 3macs in late fiscal 2016 and a stronger market environment compared to the prior year. the segment also benefited from the impact of higher short-term interest rates, resulting in increases in fees related to our rjbdp and interest income. non-interest expenses increased $773 million, or 24%, primarily resulting from an increase in sales commission expense, increased legal expenses related to the jay peak settlement and increased administrative &amp; incentive compensation and benefits expense.
•   the capital markets segment generated net revenues of $1.01 billion, a 1% increase, while pre-tax income also increased 1% to $141 million. the increase in net revenues was primarily due to an increase in merger &amp; acquisition and advisory fee revenues and equity underwriting fees, partially offset by a decline in institutional sales commissions and trading profits, reflecting lower levels of volatility, and a decline in tax credit funds syndication revenues resulting from uncertainty over corporate tax reform. non-interest expenses increased $16 million, or 2%, primarily resulting from an increase in incentive compensation and benefits expense largely related to improved investment banking results.
•   our asset management segment benefited from increased fee-based client assets, generating a 21% increase in net revenues to $488 million, while pre-tax income increased 30% to $172 million. the increase in net revenues primarily reflected increases in advisory fee revenues from managed programs and in non-discretionary asset-based administration fee revenues as financial assets under management in managed programs and assets held in non-discretionary asset-based programs increased 25% and 32%, respectively over the prior year level. non-interest expenses increased $42 million, or 16%, primarily resulting from increased investment sub-advisory fees and growth-related increases in administrative &amp; incentive compensation and benefits expense.
•   rj bank generated a 20% increase in net revenues to $593 million, while pre-tax income increased 21% to $409 million. the increase in pre-tax income resulted primarily from an increase in net interest income and a decrease in the provision for loan losses, partially offset by higher affiliate deposit fees paid to the private client group due to an increase in client account balances. net interest income increased due to both growth in average interest-earning assets and an increase in the net interest margin which benefited from the impact of higher short-term interest rates.
•   activities in our other segment generated a pre-tax loss that was $21 million, or 14% more than the prior year, primarily due to the losses on the early extinguishment of certain senior notes payable, combined with higher interest expense related to a higher average balance of our senior notes payable for the fiscal year. total revenues in the segment increased $19 million, or 41%, primarily due to higher net valuation gains from our private equity portfolio and an increase in interest income due to increased short-term interest rates and higher corporate cash balances.

raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis reconciliation of gaap measures to non-gaap measures we utilize certain non-gaap measures to enhance the understanding of our financial results and related measures. we believe that the non-gaap measures provide useful information by excluding certain material items that may not be indicative of our core operating results. we believe that these non-gaap measures allow for better evaluation of the operating performance of the business and facilitate a meaningful comparison of our results in the current year to those in prior and future years. these non-gaap measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap. in addition, our non-gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled non-gaap measures of other companies. the following table provides a reconciliation of gaap measures to non-gaap measures for the periods which include non-gaap adjustments.

raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis net interest analysis the federal reserve bank increased its benchmark short-term interest rate four times in fiscal 2018 in 25 basis point increments, compared with three 25 basis point increases in fiscal 2017 and one 25 basis point increase in fiscal 2016. these increases in short-term interest rates have had a significant impact on our overall financial performance, as we have certain assets and liabilities, primarily held in our pcg and rj bank segments, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. given the relationship of our interest-sensitive assets to liabilities held in each of these segments, increases in short-term interest rates generally result in an overall increase in our net earnings, although the magnitude of the impact to our net interest margin depends upon the yields on interest-earning assets relative to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. conversely, any decreases in short-term interest rates and/or increases in the deposit rates paid to clients would likely have a negative impact on our earnings.
refer to the discussion of the specific components of our net interest income within the "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition - results of operations" for our rj bank, pcg and other segments.

results of operations - private client group through our pcg segment, we provide investment advisory and securities transaction services for which we charge asset-based fees or sales commissions. such revenues are included in "securities commissions and fees." revenues of this segment are correlated with the level of pcg client assets under administration, including fee-based accounts, as well as the overall u.s. equity markets. in
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis periods where equity markets improve, assets under administration and client activity generally increase, thereby having a favorable impact on net revenues.
we also earn certain servicing fees, such as omnibus and education and marketing support ("ems") fees from mutual fund and annuity companies whose products we distribute, and from banks to which we sweep client cash in the rjbdp. such fees are included in "account and service fees." servicing fees earned by mutual fund and annuity companies are generally based on the level of assets or number of positions in such programs. fees earned from our rjbdp are generally based on client cash balances in the program, as well as the level of short-term interest rates relative to interest paid to clients on balances in the rjbdp.
net interest revenue in the pcg segment is generated by interest earnings on margin loans provided to clients and on cash segregated pursuant to regulations, less interest paid on client cash balances. higher client cash balances generally lead to increased interest income, depending on spreads realized in our client interest program. for more information on client cash balances, see our previous discussion of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities in the net interest analysis section of this md&a.

pcg assets under administration increased 15% in each of the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018 and 2017, resulting from equity market appreciation and net client inflows. net client inflows in each year were primarily attributable to strong financial advisor recruiting and retention. pcg assets in fee-based accounts continued to increase as a percentage of overall pcg assets under administration, representing 48% at september 30, 2018, compared to 45% at september 30, 2017 and 40% at september 30, 2016, due in part to clients moving to fee-based alternatives from traditional transaction-based accounts in response to the regulatory environment.
financial advisors:                                            september 30,
(1)   includes 126 registered individuals who met the requirements to be classified as financial advisors in fiscal year 2018 following our periodic review procedures.
(2)   during the year ended september 30, 2017, we refined the criteria to determine our financial advisor population, which resulted in a decrease in our previously reported counts of approximately 100 advisors as of the date of our adoption. the impact of the change in methodology did not have a significant impact on the fiscal 2016 period, and thus we have not revised the number of financial advisors reported in fiscal 2016.
the net increase in financial advisors as of september 30, 2018 compared to september 30, 2017 and september 30, 2016 primarily resulted from strong financial advisor recruiting and high levels of retention throughout fiscal year 2018 and 2017. we believe the increases in financial advisors and assets under administration are a positive indication of potential future revenue growth in this segment.

a significant portion of our clients' cash is included in our rjbdp, a multi-bank sweep program in which clients' cash deposits in their brokerage accounts are swept into interest-bearing deposit accounts at rj bank and various third-party banks. we earn fees from third-party banks which fluctuate based on the amount of cash swept to such banks, as well as changes in short-term interest rates relative to deposit rates paid on client cash balances. fees from third-party banks are recorded in "account and service fees" in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. pcg also earns fees from rj bank for clients' cash balances swept to rj bank. such fees are included in "affiliate deposit account servicing fees from rj bank" in the "operating results" table above and are eliminated in consolidation.
recent short-term interest rate increases by the fed had a significant impact on fees earned from third-party banks in rjbdp, despite the decline in rjbdp balances at such banks, but have not had as significant of an impact on market deposit rates paid on client cash balances. as a result, rjbdp fees have increased significantly over the prior years. however, we expect market deposit rates to continue to rise with future increases in short-term interest rates. as such, any future increases in short-term interest rates may have less of a positive impact on fees earned from rjbdp depending on the level of deposit rates paid on client cash balances. conversely,
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis any decreases in short-term interest rates and/or increases in the deposit rates paid to clients would likely have a negative impact on our earnings.
year ended september 30, 2018 compared with the year ended september 30, 2017
net revenues of $5.09 billion increased $671 million, or 15%. the portion of segment net revenues that we consider to be recurring was 82% for fiscal 2018, an increase from 79% for fiscal 2017.  recurring revenues include asset-based fees, trailing commissions from mutual funds and variable annuities/insurance products, mutual fund and annuity service fees, fees earned on funds in our rjbdp and interest.
securities commissions and fees increased $514 million, or 14%. the increase in securities commissions and fees revenue was primarily driven by an increase in client assets, resulting from higher equity markets and strong financial advisor recruiting and retention. commissions earned from insurance and annuity products and equity products also increased during the year. offsetting these increases, new issue sales credits declined compared with fiscal 2017 due to lower equity underwriting activity.
total account and service fees increased $120 million, or 18%, primarily due to higher rjbdp fees resulting from an increase in short-term interest rates over the prior year. mutual fund and annuity service fees also increased, reflecting higher ems fees and mutual fund omnibus fees. the increase in ems fees was primarily due to increased assets in the program, while the increase in omnibus fees was a result of both an increase in assets and the number of positions invested in fund families on the omnibus platform.
non-interest expenses increased $468 million, or 12%, primarily due to an increase in sales commissions expense, which increased $397 million, or 15%, in line with the increase in securities commissions and fees. administrative and incentive compensation and benefit costs increased $123 million, or 17%, primarily due to increased staffing levels to support our continued growth and regulatory compliance requirements. communications and information processing expense increased $40 million, or 21%, as a result of our continued investment in technology infrastructure to support our growth. offsetting these increases was a $130 million decrease in expenses related to the jay peak matter, which was settled in fiscal 2017.
year ended september 30, 2017 compared with the year ended september 30, 2016
net revenues of $4.42 billion in fiscal 2017 increased $805 million, or 22%. the portion of segment net revenues that we consider to be recurring was 79% for fiscal 2017, an increase from 77% for fiscal 2016. pre-tax income of $373 million, which was negatively impacted by the jay peak settlement, increased $32 million, or 10%.
securities commissions and fees in fiscal 2017 increased $588 million, or 20%, primarily due to strong recruiting results, the acquisitions of alex. brown and 3macs in late fiscal 2016 and a stronger market environment compared to fiscal 2016.
account and service fees in fiscal 2017 increased $175 million, or 34%, primarily due to higher rjbdp fees resulting from an increase in short-term interest rates during the year. mutual fund and annuity service fees also increased, reflecting higher ems fees and mutual fund omnibus fees. the increase in ems fees was primarily due to increased assets in the program. the increase in omnibus fees was a result of an increase in the number of positions invested in fund families on the omnibus platform.
net interest income increased $40 million, or 41%. interest income increased as a result of the impact of an increase in short-term interest rates on segregated cash balances and increased client margin balances, largely driven by our september 2016 acquisition of alex. brown. the favorable impact of the growth in margin balances was partially offset by a decrease in average client margin rates on the portfolio. interest expense increased, albeit to a much lesser extent, primarily due to an increase in client cash balances and an increase in the interest rate paid to clients on such balances.
non-interest expenses in fiscal 2017 increased $773 million, or 24%.  sales commissions increased $460 million, or 21%, relatively in line with the increase in securities commissions and fees. administrative and incentive compensation and benefit costs increased
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis
$118 million, or 20%, primarily resulting from additional staffing levels, primarily in operations and information technology functions, to support our continued growth and increased regulatory and compliance requirements.

raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis year ended september 30, 2018 compared with the year ended september 30, 2017
total securities commissions and fees decreased $66 million, or 13%, reflecting decreases in both fixed income and equity institutional commissions. institutional fixed income commissions continued to reflect challenging market conditions and low levels of client activity due to the flattening yield curve and relatively low interest rate volatility. the decline in equity commissions reflected lower equity underwriting activity, as well as market-driven challenges such as the industry trend toward separate payment for research and execution services and the shift from high-touch execution services to low-touch execution services.
net trading profits declined $25 million, or 32%, reflecting the challenging market conditions for fixed income during the current year.
investment banking revenues increased $42 million, or 11%, reflecting strong merger & acquisition activity. merger & acquisition and advisory fees increased $68 million, or 30%, due to both a higher volume of transactions and higher average fees per transaction, and aided by the expansion of our investment banking business in europe. this increase was partially offset by lower equity underwriting revenues, which declined $20 million, or 27%, reflecting lower levels of client activity. fixed income investment banking also declined compared with the prior year, reflecting the impact of lower public finance activity due to higher interest rates and tax reform.
non-interest expenses decreased slightly compared with the prior year, as a decline in compensation, commissions and benefits expense was largely offset by an increase in business development expense.
year ended september 30, 2017 compared with the year ended september 30, 2016
net revenues in fiscal 2017 of $1.01 billion increased $12 million, or 1%, led by higher merger & acquisition and advisory fees and equity underwriting revenues, partially offset by lower institutional sales commissions. pre-tax income of $141 million increased $2 million, or 1%.
total securities commissions and fees for fiscal 2017 decreased $54 million, or 10%. institutional fixed income commissions decreased $48 million, or 15%, driven by lower client trading volumes, as fixed income was faced with a challenging operating environment characterized by low levels of volatility and a flattening yield curve. institutional equity sales commissions decreased $5 million, or 2%, primarily reflecting the impact of low levels of volatility.
merger & acquisition and advisory fees increased $80 million, or 54%, primarily due to a stronger volume of both domestic and foreign merger & acquisition activity in fiscal year 2017 compared to low levels in the prior year, as well as higher average fees per transaction. fiscal year 2017 also benefited from the impact of a full year of revenues related to our june 2016 acquisition of mummert & company corporate finance gmbh ("mummert").
equity underwriting fees increased $18 million, or 34%, primarily due to the improved equity market conditions compared with a difficult fiscal 2016. the total number of both lead-managed and co-managed underwritings increased significantly over the prior year levels.
net revenues related to our public finance underwriting and advisory activities remained solid during our 2017 fiscal year and increased slightly compared with fiscal 2016.
despite the uncertainty related to the outcome of any corporate tax reform initiatives, our tax credit funds reflected good performance during fiscal year 2017. this uncertainty did depress new investment activity amongst syndicators of low-income housing tax credit fund ("lihtc") investments toward the end of fiscal year 2017 and, as a result, our tax credit fund syndication fees decreased $5 million, or 9%, from fiscal year 2016 levels.
net trading profit decreased $10 million, or 11%, compared with a strong fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower market volatility.
non-interest expenses for fiscal 2017 increased $16 million, or 2%.  compensation, commissions and benefits expenses increased $8 million, or 1%, primarily resulting from a net increase in incentive compensation as a result of the increase in investment banking net revenues offset by a decrease in compensation related to lower institutional fixed income commission revenues during fiscal year 2017.

("rj trust"). the segment also provides investment advisory and asset management services to individual and institutional investors, including through third-party broker-dealers, through carillon tower advisers and its affiliates (collectively, "carillon tower"), which also sponsors a family of mutual funds.
we earn investment advisory fees and related administrative fees based on assets under management in both ams and carillon tower, where decisions are made by in-house or third-party portfolio managers or investment committees on how to invest client assets.
the asset management segment also earns administrative fees on certain asset-based programs offered to pcg clients which are not managed by our asset management segment, but for which the segment provides administrative support, including trade execution, record-keeping and periodic investor reporting.
fees are earned based on balances either at the beginning of the quarter, the end of the quarter, or average daily assets. asset balances are impacted by both the performance of the relevant market and the new sales (inflows) and redemptions (outflows) of client accounts/funds. rising equity markets have historically had a positive impact on revenues as existing accounts increase in value, and individuals and institutions may commit incremental funds in rising markets. for an overview of our asset management segment operations, refer to the information presented in item 1 "business" of this form 10-k.

selected key metrics managed programs - our investment advisory fees recorded in this segment were earned based on balances either at the beginning of the quarter, end of the quarter or average assets throughout the quarter. for the year ended september 30, 2018, approximately 55% of our fees were determined based on asset balances at the beginning of each quarter, approximately 20% were based on asset balances at the end of each quarter and the remaining 25% were based on average assets throughout each quarter. for the years ended september 30, 2017 and 2016, approximately 70% of our fees were determined based on asset balances at the beginning of each quarter, approximately 15% were based on asset balances at the end of each quarter and the remaining 15% were based on average assets throughout each quarter. as of september 30, 2018, a greater percentage of fees were determined either based on asset balances at the end of the quarter or on average assets throughout the quarter compared to september 30, 2017. this shift in timing is directly attributable to our scout group acquisition.

(1)   includes approximately $2.0 billion of client assets resulting from our acquisition of alex. brown.
non-discretionary asset-based programs - our assets held in certain non-discretionary asset-based programs for which the asset management segment does not exercise discretion but provides administrative support (including those managed for affiliated entities) totaled $200.1 billion, $157.0 billion, and $119.3 billion as of september 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the increase in assets in fiscal year 2018 over the prior year level was primarily due to market appreciation and to clients moving to fee-based accounts from traditional transaction-based accounts partly in response to regulatory changes. the majority of the administrative fees associated with these programs are determined based on balances at the beginning of the quarter.
year ended september 30, 2018 compared with the year ended september 30, 2017
total investment advisory and related administrative fee revenues increased $152 million, or 36%, primarily driven by an increase in financial assets under management. the increase in financial assets under management was primarily a result of the scout group acquisition, as well as both net market appreciation and inflows related to financial advisor recruiting. administrative fees also increased over the prior year due to the aforementioned increase in assets held in non-discretionary asset-based programs.
account and service fees and other income increased $15 million, or 21%, primarily reflecting increased shareholder servicing fees as a result of the scout group acquisition, as well as increased trust fee revenue due to an 11% increase in assets in rj trust.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis non-interest expenses increased $100 million, or 32%, primarily the result of a $47 million increase in compensation and benefits expense, a $26 million increase in other expense and a $14 million increase in investment sub-advisory fees. compensation and benefits expense increased primarily due to the scout group acquisition, in addition to annual salary increases and an increase in personnel over the prior year to support the growth of the business. the increase in other expense was primarily due to certain incremental costs associated with the scout group acquisition, including platform fees related to the new funds offered, as well as the amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisition. the increase in investment sub-advisory fees resulted from increased assets under management in applicable programs.
total investment advisory and related administrative fee revenues increased $73 million, or 21%. investment advisory fee revenues arising from managed programs increased $56 million, or 21%, and fee revenues on non-discretionary asset-based administration activities increased $17 million, or 23%, both resulting from the increases in assets held by such programs, including the impact of the alex. brown acquisition at the end of our 2016 fiscal year. financial assets under management and non-discretionary assets were positively impacted by net financial advisor growth, the move to fee based accounts as a result of anticipated regulatory changes and market appreciation.
account and service fees and other increased $11 million, or 18%, primarily resulting from rj trust which generated increased trust fee revenue arising from the increase in trust assets to $5.5 billion as of september 30, 2017, as well as increased shareholder servicing fees.
non-interest expenses increased $42 million, or 16%, primarily resulting from a $19 million, or 33%, increase in investment sub-advisory fees and a $10 million, or 9%, increase in compensation and benefits expense. the increase in investment sub-advisory fees resulted from the increase in assets under management in applicable programs. the increase in compensation and benefits expense resulted primarily from annual salary increases as well as increases in personnel to support the growth of the business. other expenses increased $10 million, or 17%, as a result of additional regulatory and compliance costs.
the results presented do not include any acquisition-related expenses associated with acquisition of the scout group which closed in november 2017. the acquisition-related expenses incurred in fiscal year 2017 related to this acquisition are reflected in the other segment. see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for further information about this acquisition.
results of operations - rj bank rj bank provides corporate loans (c&i, cre and cre construction), sbl, tax-exempt and residential loans. rj bank is active in corporate loan syndications and participations. rj bank also provides fdic-insured deposit accounts to clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries. rj bank generates net interest revenue principally through the interest income earned on loans and an investment portfolio of securities, which is offset by the interest expense it pays on client deposits and on its borrowings. higher interest-earning asset balances generally lead to increased net interest earnings, depending upon spreads realized on net interest-bearing liabilities. for more information on average interest-earning asset and interest- bearing liability balances, see the following discussion in this md&a.

year ended september 30, 2018 compared with the year ended september 30, 2017
net interest income increased $130 million, or 23%, due to a $3.19 billion increase in average interest-earning banking assets, as well as an increase in net interest margin. the increase in average interest-earning banking assets was driven by growth in average loans of $2.15 billion and a $967 million increase in our average available-for-sale securities portfolio. the net interest margin increased to 3.22% from 3.10%, due to an increase in asset yields, offset by an increase in the total cost of funds. the increase in asset yields primarily resulted from an increase in the loan portfolio yield due to an increase in interest rates. the total cost of funds increased primarily due to an increase in deposit costs, a result of increased interest rates and balances. corresponding to the increase in average interest-earning banking assets, average interest-bearing banking liabilities increased $3.00 billion.
the loan loss provision increased by $7 million, primarily due to higher corporate loan growth, partially offset by lower reserve rates on pass-rated, corporate loans as a result of improved credit characteristics.
non-interest expenses (excluding the loan loss provision) increased $44 million, or 26%, including a $24 million increase in affiliate deposit account servicing fees to pcg due to an increase in client accounts and a $7 million increase in compensation and benefits expense resulting from compensation increases and staff additions to support the growth of the business.
net interest income increased $96 million, or 20%, primarily due to a $2.92 billion increase in average interest-earning banking assets and an increase in net interest margin. the increase in average interest-earning banking assets was driven by a $1.94 billion increase in average loans and a $1.03 billion increase in our average available-for-sale securities portfolio. the net interest margin increased to 3.10% from 3.04% due to an increase in the total banking assets yield, partially offset by an increase in rj bank's total cost of funds. the increase in the total banking assets yield was primarily due to an increase in the loan portfolio yield resulting from an overall rise in market interest rates. the increase in the total cost of funds primarily resulted from the rise in market interest rates as well as an increase in average fhlb advances. corresponding to the increase in average interest-earning banking assets, average interest-bearing banking liabilities increased $2.83 billion.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis the loan loss provision decreased $15 million, or 54%, due to the change in mix of loan growth during fiscal 2017. growth was significantly lower in the c&i loan portfolio during the year, which has higher allowance percentages, and was higher in the residential mortgage loans, securities-based loans and tax-exempt loans portfolios, which have lower allowance percentages. this positive impact was partially offset by additional provision during the current year for c&i loans and cre loans in specific industry sectors.
during august and september 2017, texas and florida suffered severe damage from hurricanes harvey and irma. we performed an assessment of the impact to our loan portfolio associated with these weather-related events and determined that only our residential mortgage loan portfolio could be impacted. a qualitative adjustment was made to the allowance for loan losses during the 2017 fiscal year with respect to the residential mortgage loan portfolio.
non-interest expenses (excluding the loan loss provision) increased $42 million, or 33%, primarily reflecting a $25 million increase in affiliate deposit account servicing fees to pcg due to an increase in client accounts and a $4 million increase in compensation and benefits expense resulting from compensation increases and staff additions to support the growth of the business.

the yield on tax-exempt loans in the preceding table is presented on a tax-equivalent basis utilizing the applicable federal statutory rates for each of the years presented.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. the following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. the effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous year's average yield/cost. similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous year's volume. changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately.

net revenues in this segment increased $15 million, or 49%, due to an increase in our net interest expense, partially offset by lower net gains on our private equity investments.
non-interest expenses decreased $58 million, or 45%, as the prior year included a $46 million loss on extinguishment of debt comprised of a make-whole premium and the acceleration of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the early extinguishment of our senior notes during the prior year. acquisition-related expenses in fiscal year 2018, which were $14 million lower than the prior year, pertained to certain incremental expenses incurred in connection with our acquisition of the scout group, which closed in november 2017. prior year acquisition-related expenses primarily related to our acquisitions of the scout group, as well as our fiscal year 2016 acquisitions of alex. brown and 3macs. see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k for information regarding the components of these expenses.
net revenues in this segment decreased $2 million, or 6%, due to higher net gains arising from our private equity investments portfolio, which increased $8 million, a portion of which relates to noncontrolling interests, compared to fiscal 2016.

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is essential to our business.  the primary goal of our liquidity management activities is to ensure adequate funding to conduct our business over a range of economic and market environments.
senior management establishes our liquidity and capital management framework. this framework includes senior management's review of short- and long-term cash flow forecasts, review of monthly capital expenditures, monitoring of the availability of alternative sources of financing, and daily monitoring of liquidity in our significant subsidiaries. our decisions on the allocation of capital to our business units consider, among other factors, projected profitability and cash flow, risk, and impact on future liquidity needs. our treasury department assists in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our financial condition, liquidity and capital structure, and maintains our relationships with various lenders. the objective of this framework is to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity.
liquidity is provided primarily through our business operations and financing activities.  financing activities could include bank borrowings, repurchase agreement transactions or additional capital raising activities under our "universal" shelf registration statement.
cash and cash equivalents decreased $169 million to $3.50 billion at september 30, 2018 due to the firm using $3.48 billion of cash for its investing activities, primarily investments in bank loans and our available-for-sale securities portfolio during the year. offsetting the cash used for investing activities, operating activities provided $1.90 billion of cash during the year. financing activities provided cash of $1.42 billion, primarily driven by an increase in bank deposits, as rj bank retained a higher portion of rjbdp balances, partially offset by repayments of short-term borrowings and payments of dividends to our shareholders during the year.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis we believe our existing assets, most of which are liquid in nature, together with funds generated from operations and available from committed and uncommitted financing facilities provide adequate funds for continuing operations at current levels of activity.
sources of liquidity approximately $1.40 billion of our total september 30, 2018 cash and cash equivalents included cash on hand at the parent, as well as parent cash loaned to rj&a.  the following table presents our holdings of cash and cash equivalents.
rjf maintained depository accounts at rj bank with a balance of $277 million as of september 30, 2018. the portion of this total that was available on demand without restrictions, which amounted to $254 million as of september 30, 2018, is reflected in the rjf total (and is excluded from the rj bank cash balance in the preceding table).
rjf had loaned $735 million to rj&a as of september 30, 2018 (such amount is included in the rj&a cash balance in the preceding table), which rj&a has invested on behalf of rjf in cash and cash equivalents or otherwise deployed in its normal business activities. on october 1, 2018 we deposited approximately $400 million of cash into rj&a's segregated reserve accounts as a result of its year end reserve calculation.
in addition to the cash balances described, we have various other potential sources of cash available to the parent from subsidiaries, as described in the following section.
liquidity available from subsidiaries liquidity is principally available to rjf, the parent company, from rj&a and rj bank.
rj&a is required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $1 million or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from client transactions. in addition, covenants in rj&a's committed secured financing facilities require its net capital to be a minimum of 10% of aggregate debit items.  at september 30, 2018, rj&a significantly exceeded both the minimum regulatory requirements and the covenants in its financing arrangements pertaining to net capital. at that date, rj&a had excess net capital of $868 million, of which $438 million was available for dividend while still maintaining the internally-targeted net capital ratio of 15% of aggregate debit items.  there are also limitations on the amount of dividends that may be declared by a broker-dealer without finra approval.
rj bank may pay dividends to rjf without the prior approval of its regulator as long as the dividend does not exceed the sum of rj bank's current calendar year and the previous two calendar years' retained net income, and rj bank maintains its targeted regulatory capital ratios.  at september 30, 2018, rj bank had $226 million of capital in excess of the amount it would need at september 30, 2018 to maintain its targeted regulatory capital ratios, and could pay a dividend of such amount without requiring prior approval of its regulator.
although we have liquidity available to us from our other subsidiaries, the available amounts are not as significant as those previously described and, in certain instances, may be subject to regulatory requirements.
borrowings and financing arrangements committed financing arrangements our ability to borrow is dependent upon compliance with the conditions in our various loan agreements and, in the case of secured borrowings, collateral eligibility requirements. our committed financing arrangements are in the form of either tri-party repurchase agreements or, in the case of the rjf credit facility, an unsecured line of credit. the required market value of the collateral associated with the committed secured facilities ranges from 102% to 125% of the amount financed.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis the following table presents our committed financing arrangements with third-party lenders, which we generally utilize to finance a portion of our fixed income trading instruments held, and the outstanding balances related thereto.

uncommitted financing arrangements our uncommitted financing arrangements are in the form of secured lines of credit, secured bilateral or tri-party repurchase agreements, or unsecured lines of credit. our arrangements with third-party lenders are generally utilized to finance a portion of our fixed income securities or for cash management purposes. our uncommitted secured financing arrangements generally require us to post collateral in excess of the amount borrowed. as of september 30, 2018, we had outstanding borrowings under two uncommitted secured borrowing arrangements with lenders out of a total of 13 uncommitted financing arrangements (seven uncommitted secured and six uncommitted unsecured). however, lenders are under no contractual obligation to lend to us under uncommitted credit facilities.
the following table presents our borrowings on uncommitted financing arrangements, all of which were in rj&a.
uncommitted secured                  $186,205
uncommitted unsecured                -
other financings rj bank had $875 million in fhlb borrowings outstanding at september 30, 2018, comprised of floating-rate advances totaling $850 million and a $25 million fixed-rate advance, all of which were secured by a blanket lien on rj bank's residential mortgage loan portfolio (see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for additional information regarding these borrowings). rj bank had an additional $1.79 billion in immediate credit available from the fhlb as of september 30, 2018 and, with the pledge of additional eligible collateral to the fhlb, total available credit of up to 30% of total assets.
rj bank is eligible to participate in the frb's discount-window program; however, we do not view borrowings from the frb as a primary source of funding.  the credit available in this program is subject to periodic review, may be terminated or reduced at the discretion of the frb, and is secured by pledged c&i loans.
we act as an intermediary between broker-dealers and other financial institutions whereby we borrow securities from one broker-dealer and then lend them to another.  where permitted, we have also loaned, to broker-dealers and other financial institutions, securities owned by clients, others or the firm.  we account for each of these types of transaction as collateralized agreements and financings, with the outstanding balances related to the securities loaned included in "securities loaned" on our consolidated statements of financial condition of this form 10-k, in the amount of $423 million as of september 30, 2018. such financings are generally collateralized by cash or other collateral.  see note 7 of the notes to consolidate financial statements of this form 10-k for more information on our securities borrowed and securities loaned.
from time to time we purchase securities under agreements to resell ("reverse repurchase agreements") and sell securities under agreements to repurchase ("repurchase agreements").  we account for each of these types of transactions as collateralized agreements and financings, with the outstanding balances on the repurchase agreements included in "securities sold under agreements to repurchase" on our consolidated statements of financial condition of this form 10-k, in the amount $186 million as of september 30, 2018 (which
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis are reflected in the preceding table of uncommitted financing arrangements). such financings are generally collateralized by non-customer, rj&a-owned securities or by securities that we have received as collateral under reverse repurchase agreements.
the average daily balance outstanding during the five most recent successive quarters, the maximum month-end balance outstanding during the quarter and the period-end balances for repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements is detailed in the following table.

at september 30, 2018, in addition to the financing arrangements previously described, we had $24 million outstanding on a mortgage loan for our st. petersburg, florida home-office complex, that is included in "other borrowings" in our consolidated statements of financial condition of this form 10-k.
at september 30, 2018 we had aggregate outstanding senior notes payable of $1.55 billion. our senior notes payable, exclusive of any unaccreted premiums or discounts and debt issuance costs, was comprised of $250 million par 5.625% senior notes due 2024, $500 million par 3.625% senior notes due 2026, and $800 million par 4.95% senior notes due 2046. see note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for additional information.
rating agency                            rating   outlook standard &amp; poor's ratings services   bbb+     stable moody's investors services               baa1     stable our current long-term debt ratings depend upon a number of factors, including industry dynamics, operating and economic environment, operating results, operating margins, earnings trends and volatility, balance sheet composition, liquidity and liquidity management, capital structure, overall risk management, business diversification and market share, and competitive position in the markets in which we operate. deteriorations in any of these factors could impact our credit ratings.  any rating downgrades could increase our costs in the event we were to obtain additional financing.
should our credit rating be downgraded prior to a public debt offering, it is probable that we would have to offer a higher rate of interest to bond holders.  a downgrade to below investment grade may make a public debt offering difficult to execute on terms we would consider to be favorable.  a downgrade below investment grade could result in the termination of certain derivative contracts and the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions (see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for additional information). a credit downgrade could damage our reputation and result in certain counterparties limiting their business with us, result in negative comments by analysts, and potentially negatively impact investor perception of us, and cause a decline in our stock price and/or our clients' perception of us. a credit downgrade would result in rjf incurring a higher commitment fee on any unused balance on the $300 million rjf credit facility, in addition to triggering a higher interest rate applicable to any borrowings outstanding on that line as of and subsequent to such downgrade. conversely, an improvement in rjf's current credit rating could have a favorable impact on the commitment fee, as well as the interest rate, applicable to any borrowings on such line. none of our borrowing arrangements contain a condition or event of default related to our credit ratings.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis other sources and uses of liquidity we have company-owned life insurance policies which are utilized to fund certain non-qualified deferred compensation plans and other employee benefit plans. certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans and other employee benefit plans are employee-directed while others are company-directed. certain policies which we could readily borrow against had a cash surrender value of $504 million as of september 30, 2018, comprised of $292 million related to employee-directed plans and $212 million related to company-directed plans, and we were able to borrow up to 90%, or $454 million, of the september 30, 2018 total without restriction.  to effect any such borrowing, the underlying investments would be converted to money market investments, therefore requiring us to take market risk related to the employee-directed plans. there were no borrowings outstanding against any of these policies as of september 30, 2018.
between october 1, 2018 and november 19, 2018, we utilized the remaining $214 million under our board authorization to repurchase 2.77 million shares of our common stock at a weighted-average price of $77.25. see item 5 "market for registrant's common equity, related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" of this form 10-k for more information.
on may 18, 2018, we filed a "universal" shelf registration statement with the sec to be in a position to access the capital markets if and when necessary or perceived by us to be opportune.
see the contractual obligations section of this md&a for information regarding our contractual obligations.
statement of financial condition analysis the assets on our consolidated statements of financial condition consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents (a large portion of which is segregated for the benefit of clients), receivables including bank loans, financial instruments held for either trading purposes or as investments, and other assets.  a significant portion of our assets were liquid in nature, providing us with flexibility in financing our business.
total assets of $37.41 billion as of september 30, 2018 were $2.53 billion, or 7%, higher than our total assets as of september 30, 2017. the increase in assets was primarily due to a $2.51 billion increase in net bank loans and a $508 million increase in our available-for-sale securities portfolio, in line with our growth plans for such assets, as well as a $576 million increase in brokerage client receivables reflecting client activity. offsetting these increases, cash segregated pursuant to regulations decreased $1.03 billion compared with september 30, 2017.
as of september 30, 2018, our total liabilities of $30.96 billion were $1.77 billion, or 6%, higher than our total liabilities as of september 30, 2017, primarily reflecting a $2.21 billion increase in bank deposits, as rj bank retained a higher portion of rjbdp balances to fund a portion of our loan and available-for-sale securities portfolio growth. brokerage client payables increased $213 million, due to an increase in client cash held at the firm as of september 30, 2018. offsetting these increases was a $615 million decrease in other borrowings due to the repayment of certain borrowings during the year.

contractual interest payments represent estimated future interest payments related to our senior notes, mortgage note payable, fhlb advances, and unsecured borrowings with original maturities greater than one year based on applicable interest rates at september 30, 2018. estimated future interest payments for fhlb advances include the effect of the related interest rate hedges, which swap variable interest rate payments to fixed interest payments. see notes 14 and 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for information regarding our senior notes payable and other borrowings.
in the normal course of our business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. purchase obligations for purposes of this table include amounts associated with agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including: minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. our most significant purchase obligations are vendor contracts for data services, communication services, processing services, computer software contracts and our stadium naming rights contract which goes through 2027. most of our contracts have provisions for early termination. for purposes of this table we have assumed we would not pursue early termination of such contracts.
we have entered into investment commitments, lending commitments and other commitments to extend credit for which we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of future payments. see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for further information.
regulatory refer to the discussion of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the impact on our operations of certain rules and regulations in item 1 "business - regulation" of this form 10-k.
rjf and many of its subsidiaries are each subject to various regulatory capital requirements. as of september 30, 2018, all of our active regulated domestic and international subsidiaries had net capital in excess of minimum requirements. in addition, rjf and rj bank were categorized as "well capitalized" as of september 30, 2018.
the maintenance of certain risk-based regulatory capital levels could impact various capital allocation decisions impacting one or more of our businesses.  however, due to the strong capital position of rjf and its regulated subsidiaries, we do not anticipate these capital requirements will have a negative impact on our future business activities.
see note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for information on regulatory and capital requirements.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during any reporting period in our consolidated financial statements. management has established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure the appropriateness of such estimates and assumptions and their consistent application from period to period. for a description of our significant accounting policies, see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k.
we believe that of our accounting estimates and assumptions, those described in the following sections involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. therefore, understanding these critical accounting estimates is important in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position.
valuation of financial instruments the use of fair value to measure financial instruments, with related gains or losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes.
"financial instruments owned" and "financial instruments sold but not yet purchased" are reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value. unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in our net income or our other comprehensive income/(loss) ("oci"), depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument.
we measure the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap, which defines fair value, establishes a framework that we use to measure fair value and provides for certain disclosures in our financial statements. fair value is defined by gaap as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
in determining the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap, we use various valuation approaches, including market and/or income approaches. fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant. as such, our fair value measurements reflect assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. in determining fair value, gaap provides for the following three levels to be used to classify our fair value measurements.
level 1 - inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
level 2 - inputs that are other than quoted prices in active markets, but which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date (i.e., prices for similar instruments).
level 3 - inputs that cannot be observed in market activity.
gaap requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when performing our fair value measurements. the availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. in such cases, an instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument.
see notes 2, 4, 5 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for additional information on our financial instruments.
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of both september 30, 2018 and september 30, 2017, 10% of our total assets and 2% of our total liabilities were financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
financial instruments owned and measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as level 3 amounted to $124 million as of september 30, 2018, and represented 3% of our assets measured at fair value and 2% of our total equity. our level 3 assets were primarily comprised of preferred auction rate securities ("ars") and private equity investments. our level 3 assets declined $77 million compared with september 30, 2017, primarily due to sales of ars and certain private equity investments.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis valuation techniques the fair values for certain of our financial instruments are derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment. the price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of our financial instruments. financial instruments which are actively traded will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that are thinly traded. in accordance with gaap, the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability. we have determined the market for certain other types of financial instruments, including private equity investments and auction-rate securities, to be uncertain or inactive as of both september 30, 2018 and 2017. as a result, the valuation of these financial instruments included management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available. we considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors, including low levels of price transparency caused by a low volume of trades, stale transaction prices and transaction prices that varied significantly either over time or among market makers.
see notes 2 and 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for further information about the level within the fair value hierarchy, specific valuation techniques and inputs, and other significant accounting policies pertaining to financial instruments at fair value.
loss provisions loss provisions arising from legal and regulatory matters the recorded amount of liabilities related to legal and regulatory matters is subject to significant management judgment. for a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing such accruals, see the "contingent liabilities" section of note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k. in addition, refer to note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for information regarding legal and regulatory matter contingencies as of september 30, 2018.
loan loss provisions arising from operations of rj bank rj bank provides an allowance for loan losses which reflects our continuing evaluation of the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. refer to note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for discussion of rj bank's policies regarding the allowance for loan losses, and refer to note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for quantitative information regarding the allowance balance as of september 30, 2018.
at september 30, 2018, the amortized cost of all rj bank loans was $19.7 billion and an allowance for loan losses of $203 million was recorded against that balance. the total allowance for loan losses was equal to 1.04% of the amortized cost of the loan portfolio.
rj bank's process of evaluating its probable loan losses includes a complex analysis of several quantitative and qualitative factors, requiring a substantial amount of judgment. as a result, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. in such an event, any losses in excess of our allowance would result in a decrease in our net income, as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital at rj bank.

raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis effects of inflation our assets are primarily liquid in nature and are not significantly affected by inflation. however, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, including employee compensation, communications and information processing, and occupancy costs, which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services we provide to our clients.
risk management risks are an inherent part of our business and activities. management of these risks is critical to our fiscal soundness and profitability. our risk management processes are multi-faceted and require communication, judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets. we have a formal enterprise risk management ("erm") program to assess and review aggregate risks across the firm. our management takes an active role in the erm process, which requires specific administrative and business functions to participate in the identification, assessment, monitoring and control of various risks. the results of this process are extensively documented and reported to executive management and the audit and risk committee of the board of directors.
the principal risks related to our business activities are market, credit, liquidity, operational, model, and compliance.
market risk market risk is our risk of loss resulting from the impact of changes in market prices on our inventory, derivative and investment positions. we have exposure to market risk primarily through our broker-dealer trading operations and, to a lesser extent, through our banking operations. our broker-dealer subsidiaries, primarily rj&a, trade taxable and tax-exempt debt obligations and act as an active market maker in over-the-counter equity securities. in connection with these activities, we maintain inventories in order to ensure availability of securities and to facilitate client transactions. we also hold investments in mbs and cmos within rj bank's available-for-sale securities portfolio, and also from time-to-time may hold sba loan securitizations not yet transferred.
see notes 2, 4, 5 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for fair value and other information regarding our trading inventories, available-for-sale securities and derivative instruments.
changes in value of our trading inventory may result from fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, macroeconomic factors, asset liquidity and dynamic relationships among these factors. we manage our trading inventory by product type and have established trading desks with responsibility for particular product types. our primary method of controlling risk in our trading inventory is through the establishment and monitoring of risk-based limits and limits on the dollar amount of securities positions held overnight in inventory. a hierarchy of limits exists at multiple levels including firm, division, trading desk (e.g., for otc equities, corporate bonds, municipal bonds), product sub-type (e.g., below-investment-grade positions) and individual trader. position limits in trading inventory accounts are monitored on a daily basis. consolidated position and exposure reports are prepared and distributed daily to senior management. trading positions are carefully monitored for potential limit violations. management likewise monitors inventory levels and trading results, as well as inventory aging, pricing, concentration and securities ratings. for our derivatives positions, which are composed primarily of interest rate swaps but include futures contracts and forward foreign exchange contracts, we monitor daily exposure against established limits with respect to a number of factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, spread, ratio, basis and volatility risk. these derivative exposures are monitored both on a total portfolio basis and separately for each agreement for selected maturity periods.
in the normal course of business, we enter into underwriting commitments. rj&a and rj ltd., as a lead or co-lead manager or syndicate member in the underwriting deal, may be subject to market risk on any unsold shares issued in the offering to which we are committed. risk exposure is controlled by limiting participation, the deal size or through the syndication process.
interest rate risk trading activities we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our trading inventories (primarily comprised of fixed income instruments) in our capital markets segment. we actively manage the interest rate risk arising from our fixed income trading securities through the use of hedging strategies that involve u.s. treasury securities, futures contracts, liquid spread products and derivatives.
we monitor daily, the value-at-risk ("var") for all of our trading portfolios. var is an appropriate statistical technique for estimating potential losses in trading portfolios due to typical adverse market movements over a specified time horizon with a suitable confidence level. we apply the fed's market risk rule ("mrr") for the purpose of calculating our capital ratios. the mrr, also known as the
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis
"risk-based capital guidelines: market risk" rule released by the fed, occ and fdic, requires us to calculate var numbers for all of our trading portfolios, including fixed income, equity, foreign exchange and derivative instruments.
to calculate var, we use historical simulation. this approach assumes that historical changes in market conditions, such as in interest rates and equity prices, are representative of future changes. simulation is based on daily market data for the previous twelve months. var is reported at a 99% confidence level for a one-day time horizon. assuming that future market conditions change as they have in the past twelve months, we would expect to incur losses greater than those predicted by our one-day var estimates about once every 100 trading days, or about three times per year on average. for regulatory capital calculation purposes, we also report var numbers for a ten-day time horizon.
the fed's mrr requires us to perform daily back testing procedures of our var model, whereby we compare each day's projected var to its regulatory-defined daily trading losses, which exclude fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intraday trading. based on these daily "ex ante" versus "ex post" comparisons, we determine whether the number of times that regulatory-defined daily trading losses exceed var is consistent with our expectations at a 99% confidence level. during the year ended september 30, 2018, our regulatory-defined daily loss in our trading portfolios exceeded our predicted var twice.
the following table sets forth the high, low, period end and daily average var for all of our trading portfolios, including fixed income, equity, and derivative instruments, for the period and dates indicated.
the modeling of the risk characteristics of trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations. while management believes that its assumptions and approximations are reasonable, there is no uniform industry methodology for estimating var, and different assumptions or approximations could produce materially different var estimates. as a result, var statistics are more reliable when used as indicators of risk levels and trends within a firm than as a basis for inferring differences in risk-taking across firms.
separately, rjf provides additional market risk disclosures to comply with the mrr. the results of the application of this market risk capital rule are available on our website under www.raymondjames.com/investor-relations/financial-report under "market risk rule disclosure."
should markets suddenly become more volatile, actual trading losses may exceed var results presented on a single day and might accumulate over a longer time horizon, such as a number of consecutive trading days. accordingly, management applies additional controls including position limits, a daily review of trading results, review of the status of aged inventory, independent controls on pricing, monitoring of concentration risk, review of issuer ratings and stress testing. we utilize stress testing to complement our var analysis so as to measure risk under historical and hypothetical adverse scenarios. during volatile markets, we may choose to pare our trading inventories to reduce risk.
as a part of our fixed income public finance operations, we enter into forward commitments to purchase agency mbs which are issued on behalf of various state and local housing finance agencies. these activities result in exposure to interest rate risk. in order to hedge the interest rate risk to which we would otherwise be exposed between the date of the commitment and the date of sale of the mbs, we enter into to be announced ("tba") security contracts with investors for generic mbs at specific rates and prices to be delivered on settlement dates in the future. see notes 2 and 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for additional information regarding these activities.
banking operations rj bank maintains an earning asset portfolio that is comprised of cash, c&i loans, tax-exempt loans, sbl, commercial and residential real estate loans, mbs and cmos (both of which are held in the available-for-sale securities portfolio), sba loan securitizations and a trading portfolio of corporate loans.  those earning assets are primarily funded by client deposits.  based on its current earning asset portfolio, rj bank is subject to interest rate risk.  in recent years, rj bank has focused its interest rate risk analysis on the risk of market interest rates rising given the federal reserve bank's increases in short-term interest rates since december 2015.  rj bank analyzes interest rate risk based on forecasted net interest income, which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid, and the net portfolio valuation, both in a range of interest rate scenarios.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis one of the objectives of rj bank's asset liability management committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates. this committee uses several measures to monitor and limit rj bank's interest rate risk, including scenario analysis and economic value of equity.
rj bank uses simulation models and estimation techniques to assess the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates. to ensure that rj bank remains within its tolerances established for net interest income, a sensitivity analysis of net interest income to interest rate conditions is estimated under a variety of scenarios. the model estimates the sensitivity by calculating interest income and interest expense in a dynamic balance sheet environment using current repricing, prepayment, and reinvestment of cash flow assumptions over a twelve month time horizon. various interest rate scenarios are modeled in order to determine the effect those scenarios may have on net interest income. scenarios presented include instantaneous interest rate shocks of up 100 and 200 basis points and down 100 basis points. while not presented, additional rate scenarios are performed including interest rate ramps and yield curve shifts that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements. rj bank also performs simulations on time horizons up to five years to assess longer term impacts to various interest rate scenarios. on a quarterly basis, rj bank tests expected model results to actual performance. additionally, any changes made to key assumptions in the model are documented and approved by rj bank's asset liability management committee.
we utilize a hedging strategy using interest rate swaps as a result of rj bank's asset and liability management process previously described.  for further information regarding this risk management objective, see the discussion of this hedging strategy in notes 2 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k.
the following table is an analysis of rj bank's estimated net interest income over a 12 month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates (expressed in basis points) using rj bank's own asset/liability model.

in our rj bank available-for-sale securities portfolio, we hold primarily fixed-rate agency mbs and cmos which were carried at fair value in our consolidated statements of financial condition at september 30, 2018 with changes in the fair value of the portfolio recorded through oci in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. at september 30, 2018, our rj bank available-for-sale securities portfolio had a fair value of $2.63 billion with a weighted-average yield of 2.29% and average expected duration of three years. see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for additional information.
other we hold ars, which are long-term variable rate securities tied to short-term interest rates, that are accounted for as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial condition. these securities generally have embedded penalty interest rate provisions in the event auctions fail to set the security's interest rate, which are based upon a stated interest rate spread over what is typically a short-term base interest rate index. as short-term interest rates rise, the penalty rate that is specified in the security increases and the fair value of the security increases, as we estimate that at some level of increase in short-term interest rates, issuers of the securities will have the economic incentive to refinance (and thus prepay) the securities.  see notes 2, 4 and 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for additional information on these securities.
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk as a consequence of our capital markets activities. our broker-dealer activities are primarily client-driven, with the objective of meeting clients' needs while earning a trading profit to compensate for the risk associated with carrying inventory.  we attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security positions throughout each day and establishing position limits.
foreign exchange risk we are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our investments in foreign subsidiaries as well as transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the u.s. dollar. for example, a portion of our bank loan portfolio includes loans which are denominated in canadian dollars totaling $1.05 billion and $1.00 billion at september 30, 2018 and september 30, 2017, respectively. a portion of such loans are held by rj bank's canadian subsidiary, which is discussed in the following sections.
investments in foreign subsidiaries rj bank has an investment in a canadian subsidiary, resulting in foreign exchange risk. to mitigate its foreign exchange risk, rj bank utilizes short-term, forward foreign exchange contracts. these derivative agreements are primarily accounted for as net investment
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis hedges in the consolidated financial statements. see notes 2 and 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for further information regarding these derivative contracts.
we had foreign exchange risk in our investment in rj ltd. of cad 352 million at september 30, 2018, which was not hedged. foreign exchange gains/losses related to this investment are primarily reflected in oci on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for further information regarding all of our components of oci.
we also have foreign exchange risk associated with our investments in subsidiaries located in europe. these investments are not hedged and we do not believe we have material foreign exchange risk either individually, or in the aggregate, pertaining to these subsidiaries.
transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the u.s. dollar we are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our holdings of cash and certain other assets and liabilities resulting from transactions denominated in a currency other than the u.s. dollar. any currency related gains/losses arising from these foreign currency denominated balances are reflected in "other" revenues in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. the foreign exchange risk associated with a portion of such transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency are mitigated utilizing short-term, forward foreign exchange contracts. such derivatives are not designated hedges and therefore, the related gains/losses associated with these contracts are included in "other" revenues in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k for information regarding our derivative contracts.
credit risk credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a borrower's, issuer's or counterparty's ability to meet its financial obligations under contractual or agreed upon terms. the nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction, the structure and duration of that transaction, and the parties involved. credit risk is an integral component of the profit assessment of lending and other financing activities.
we are engaged in various trading and brokerage activities in which our counterparties primarily include broker-dealers, banks and other financial institutions. we are exposed to risk that these counterparties may not fulfill their obligations. the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty and/or the issuer of the instrument. we manage this risk by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits within each business segment for each counterparty, conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties, reviewing security and loan concentrations, holding and calculating the fair value of collateral on certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations, which may guarantee performance.
our client activities involve the execution, settlement, and financing of various transactions on behalf of our clients. client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis. credit exposure results from client margin accounts, which are monitored daily and are collateralized. we monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and perform analysis on a regular basis in connection with our margin lending activities. we adjust our margin requirements if we believe our risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions. in addition, when clients execute a purchase, we are at some risk that the client will renege on the trade. if this occurs, we may have to liquidate the position at a loss. however, most private clients have available funds in the account before the trade is executed.
we offer loans to financial advisors and certain other key revenue producers, primarily for recruiting, transitional cost assistance and retention purposes. we have credit risk and may incur a loss in the event that such borrower declares bankruptcy or is no longer affiliated with us. historically, such losses have not been significant due to our strong advisor retention and successful collection efforts.
we are subject to concentration risk if we hold large positions, extend large loans to, or have large commitments with a single counterparty, borrower, or group of similar counterparties or borrowers (e.g., in the same industry). securities purchased under agreements to resell consist primarily of securities issued by the u.s. government or its agencies. receivables from and payables to clients and securities borrowing and lending activities are conducted with a large number of clients and counterparties and potential concentration is carefully monitored. inventory and investment positions taken and commitments made, including underwritings, may involve exposure to individual issuers and businesses. we seek to limit this risk through careful review of the underlying business and the use of limits established by senior management, taking into consideration factors including the financial strength of the counterparty, the size of the position or commitment, the expected duration of the position or commitment and other positions or commitments outstanding.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis rj bank has substantial c&i, cre, tax-exempt, sbl and residential mortgage loan portfolios.  a significant downturn in the overall economy, deterioration in real estate values or a significant issue within any sector or sectors where rj bank has a concentration could result in large provisions for loan losses and/or charge-offs.
rj bank's strategy for credit risk management includes well-defined credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all corporate, tax-exempt, residential and sbl credit exposures. the strategy also includes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and management reviews of all corporate and tax-exempt loans as well as individual delinquent residential loans. the credit risk management process also includes an annual independent review of the credit risk monitoring process that performs assessments of compliance with credit policies, risk ratings, and other critical credit information. rj bank seeks to identify potential problem loans early, record any necessary risk rating changes and charge-offs promptly and maintain appropriate reserve levels for probable inherent losses. rj bank utilizes a comprehensive credit risk rating system to measure the credit quality of individual corporate and tax-exempt loans and related unfunded lending commitments, including the probability of default and/or loss given default of each corporate and tax-exempt loan, and commitment outstanding. for its sbl and residential mortgage loans, rj bank utilizes the credit risk rating system used by bank regulators in measuring the credit quality of each homogeneous class of loans.
rj bank's allowance for loan losses methodology is described in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k. as rj bank's loan portfolio is segregated into six portfolio segments, likewise, the allowance for loan losses is segregated by these same segments.  the risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as follows.
c&i:  loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by all assets of the business.  repayment is expected from the cash flows of the respective business.  unfavorable economic and political conditions, including the resultant decrease in consumer or business spending, may have an adverse effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment.
cre:  loans in this segment are primarily secured by income-producing properties.  for owner-occupied properties, the cash flows are derived from the operations of the business, and the underlying cash flows may be adversely affected by the deterioration in the financial condition of the operating business.  the underlying cash flows generated by non-owner-occupied properties may be adversely affected by increased vacancy and rental rates, which are monitored on a quarterly basis.  adverse developments in either of these areas may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment.
cre construction: loans in this segment have similar risk characteristics of loans in the cre segment as previously described. in addition, project budget overruns and performance variables related to the contractor and subcontractors may affect the credit quality of loans in this segment. with respect to commercial construction of residential developments, there is also the risk that the builder has a geographical concentration of developments.  adverse developments in all of these areas may significantly affect the credit quality of the loans in this segment.
tax-exempt: loans in this segment are made to governmental and nonprofit entities and are generally secured by a pledge of revenue and, in some cases, by a security interest in or a mortgage on the asset being financed. for loans to governmental entities, repayment is expected from a pledge of certain revenues or taxes. for nonprofit entities, repayment is expected from revenues which may include fundraising proceeds. these loans are subject to demographic risk, therefore much of the credit assessment of tax-exempt loans is driven by the entity's revenue base and general economic environment. adverse developments in either of these areas may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment.
residential mortgage (includes home equity loans/lines):  all of rj bank's residential mortgage loans adhere to stringent underwriting parameters pertaining to credit score and credit history, debt-to-income ratio of borrower, loan-to-value ("ltv"), and combined ltv (including second mortgage/home equity loans).  rj bank does not originate or purchase option adjustable rate mortgage ("arm") loans with negative amortization, reverse mortgages, or loans to subprime borrowers.  loans with deeply discounted teaser rates are not originated or purchased.  all loans in this segment are collateralized by residential real estate and repayment is primarily dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower.  a decline in the strength of the economy, particularly unemployment rates and housing prices, among other factors, could have a significant effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment.
sbl:  loans in this segment are generally secured by marketable securities at advance rates consistent with industry standards. these loans are monitored daily for adherence to ltv guidelines and when a loan exceeds the required ltv, a collateral call is issued. past due loans are minimal as any past due amounts result in a notice to the client for payment or the potential sale of securities which will bring the loan current.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis in evaluating credit risk, rj bank considers trends in loan performance, the level of allowance coverage relative to similar banking institutions, industry or customer concentrations, the loan portfolio composition and macroeconomic factors. there continue to be concerns over the retail and energy sectors. these factors have a potentially negative impact on loan performance and net charge-offs. however, during fiscal year 2018, corporate borrowers have continued to access the markets for new equity and debt.
several factors were taken into consideration in evaluating the allowance for loan losses at september 30, 2018, including the risk profile of the portfolios, net charge-offs during the period, the level of nonperforming loans and delinquency ratios. rj bank also considered the uncertainty related to certain industry sectors and the extent of credit exposure to specific borrowers within the portfolio. finally, rj bank considered current economic conditions that might impact the portfolio. rj bank determined the allowance that was required for specific loan grades based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio. on an ongoing basis, rj bank evaluates its methods for determining the allowance for each class of loans and makes enhancements it considers appropriate. there was no material change in rj bank's methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses during the year ended september 30, 2018.
the following table presents rj bank's changes in the allowance for loan losses.
allowance for loan losses beginning of year                        $190,442              $197,378              $172,257              $147,574              $136,501

allowance for loan losses to total bank loans outstanding              1.04   %              1.11   %              1.30   %              1.32   %              1.33   %
see explanation of the loan loss provision in item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - results of operations - rj bank" of this form 10-k. as a result of improved credit quality in the loan portfolio, the total allowance for loan losses to total bank loans outstanding declined to 1.04% at september 30, 2018 from 1.11% at september 30, 2017.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis the following tables present net loan (charge-offs)/recoveries and the percentage of net loan (charge-offs)/recoveries to the average outstanding loan balances by loan portfolio segment.
the level of charge-off activity is a factor that is considered in evaluating the potential for severity of future credit losses. net charge-offs during fiscal 2018 decreased $13 million as compared to the prior year. the decrease was due to the prior year reflecting the resolution of one c&i loan which resulted in a significant charge-off during fiscal 2017.
the following tables present the nonperforming loans balance and total allowance for loan losses balance for the periods presented.

total nonperforming loans as a % of rj bank total loans                      0.73   %
the level of nonperforming loans is another indicator of potential future credit losses. the amount of nonperforming loans decreased $14 million during the year ended september 30, 2018 primarily due to an $11 million decrease in nonperforming residential mortgage loans. included in nonperforming residential mortgage loans were $22 million in loans for which $11 million in charge-offs were previously recorded, resulting in less exposure within the remaining balance.
the nonperforming loan balances above exclude $12 million, $14 million, $14 million, $15 million and $14 million as of september 30, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, of residential troubled debt restructurings ("tdr") which were returned to accrual status in accordance with our policy. total nonperforming assets, including other real estate acquired in the settlement of residential mortgages, amounted to $28 million, $44 million, $86 million, $57 million and $86 million at as of september 30, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. total nonperforming assets as a percentage of rj bank total assets were 0.12%, 0.21%, 0.50%, 0.39% and 0.69% at as of september 30, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014 respectively.
loan underwriting policies a component of rj bank's credit risk management strategy is conservative, well-defined policies and procedures. rj bank's underwriting policies for the major types of loans are described below.
sbl and residential mortgage loan portfolios rj bank's residential mortgage loan portfolio consists of first mortgage loans originated by rj bank via referrals from our pcg financial advisors and the general public, as well as first mortgage loans purchased by rj bank. all of rj bank's residential mortgage loans adhere to strict underwriting parameters pertaining to credit score and credit history, debt-to-income ratio of the borrower, ltv, and combined ltv (including second mortgage/home equity loans). as of september 30, 2018, approximately 70% of the residential loans were fully documented loans to industry standards and 96% of the residential mortgage loan portfolio consisted of owner-occupant borrowers (78% for their primary residences and 18% for second home residences). approximately 25% of the first lien residential
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis mortgage loans were arms with interest-only payments based on a fixed rate for an initial period of the loan, typically five to seven years, then become fully amortizing, subject to annual and lifetime interest rate caps. a significant portion of our originated 15 or 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market. rj bank's sbl portfolio is comprised of loans fully collateralized by client's marketable securities and represented 15% of rj bank's total loan portfolio as of september 30, 2018. the underwriting policy for rj bank's sbl primarily includes a review of collateral, including ltv, with a limited review of repayment history.
while rj bank has chosen not to participate in any government-sponsored loan modification programs, its loan modification policy does take into consideration some of the programs' parameters and supports every effort to assist borrowers within the guidelines of safety and soundness. in general, rj bank considers the qualification terms outlined in the government-sponsored programs as well as the affordability test and other factors. rj bank retains flexibility to determine the appropriate modification structure and required documentation to support the borrower's current financial situation before approving a modification. short sales are also used by rj bank to mitigate credit losses.
corporate and tax-exempt loan portfolios rj bank's corporate and tax-exempt loan portfolios were comprised of approximately 500 borrowers, the majority of which are underwritten, managed and reviewed at our corporate headquarters location, which facilitates close monitoring of the portfolio by credit risk personnel, relationship officers and senior rj bank executives. rj bank's corporate loan portfolio is diversified among a number of industries in both the u.s. and canada and comprised of project finance real estate loans, commercial lines of credit and term loans, the majority of which are participations in shared national credit ("snc") or other large syndicated loans, and tax-exempt loans. rj bank is sometimes involved in the syndication of the loan at inception and some of these loans have been purchased in the secondary trading markets. the remainder of the corporate loan portfolio is comprised of smaller participations and direct loans. there are no subordinated loans or mezzanine financings in the corporate loan portfolio. rj bank's tax-exempt loans are long-term loans to governmental and nonprofit entities. these loans generally have lower overall credit risk, but are subject to other risks that are not usually present with corporate clients, including the risk associated with the constituency served by a local government and the risk in ensuring an obligation has appropriate tax treatment.
regardless of the source, all corporate and tax-exempt loans are independently underwritten to rj bank credit policies and are subject to approval by a loan committee, and credit quality is monitored on an on-going basis by rj bank's lending staff. rj bank credit policies include criteria related to ltv limits based upon property type, single borrower loan limits, loan term and structure parameters (including guidance on leverage, debt service coverage ratios and debt repayment ability), industry concentration limits, secondary sources of repayment, municipality demographics, and other criteria. a large portion of rj bank's corporate loans are to borrowers in industries in which we have expertise, through coverage provided by our capital markets research analysts. more than half of rj bank's corporate borrowers are public companies. rj bank's corporate loans are generally secured by all assets of the borrower, in some instances are secured by mortgages on specific real estate, and with respect to tax-exempt loans, are generally secured by a pledge of revenue. in a limited number of transactions, loans in the portfolio are extended on an unsecured basis. in addition, all corporate and tax-exempt loans are subject to rj bank's regulatory review.
risk monitoring process another component of the credit risk strategy at rj bank is the ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all residential, sbl, corporate and tax-exempt credit exposures, as well as our rigorous processes to manage and limit credit losses arising from loan delinquencies.  there are various other factors included in these processes, depending on the loan portfolio.
sbl and residential mortgage loans the marketable collateral securing rj bank's sbl is monitored on a daily basis. collateral adjustments are made by the borrower as necessary to ensure rj bank's loans are adequately secured, resulting in minimizing its credit risk. collateral calls have been minimal relative to our sbl portfolio with no losses incurred to date.
we track and review many factors to monitor credit risk in rj bank's residential mortgage loan portfolio. the qualitative factors include, but are not limited to: loan performance trends, loan product parameters and qualification requirements, borrower credit scores, occupancy (i.e., owner-occupied, second home or investment property), level of documentation, loan purpose, geographic concentrations, average loan size and loan policy exceptions.  these qualitative measures, while considered and reviewed in establishing the allowance for loan losses, have not resulted in any material quantitative adjustments to rj bank's historical loss rates.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis the following table presents a summary of delinquent residential mortgage loans, which are comprised of loans which are two or more payments past due as well as loans in the process of foreclosure.
home equity loans/lines                       23                         122                       145                   0.09           %                    0.46           %                    0.55           %
home equity loans/lines                      248                          18                       266                   0.91           %                    0.07           %                    0.98           %
at september 30, 2018, loans over 30 days delinquent (including nonperforming loans) decreased to 0.39% of residential mortgage loans outstanding, compared to 0.73% over 30 days delinquent at september 30, 2017.  our september 30, 2018 percentage continues to compare favorably to the national average for over 30 day delinquencies of 3.53%, as most recently reported by the fed.  rj bank's significantly lower delinquency rate as compared to its peers is the result of our uniform underwriting policies, the lack of subprime loans and the limited amount of non-traditional loan products.
to manage and limit credit losses, we maintain a rigorous process to manage our loan delinquencies. with all residential first mortgages serviced by a third party, the primary collection effort resides with the servicer. rj bank personnel direct and actively monitor the servicers' efforts through extensive communications regarding individual loan status changes and requirements of timely and appropriate collection or property management actions and reporting, including management of third parties used in the collection process (appraisers, attorneys, etc.). additionally, every residential mortgage loan over 60 days past due is reviewed by rj bank personnel monthly and documented in a written report detailing delinquency information, balances, collection status, appraised value, and other data points. rj bank senior management meets monthly to discuss the status, collection strategy and charge-off recommendations on every residential mortgage loan over 60 days past due. updated collateral valuations are obtained for loans over 90 days past due and charge-offs are taken on individual loans based on these valuations.
credit risk is also managed by diversifying the residential mortgage portfolio. the following table details the geographic concentrations (top five states) of rj bank's one-to-four family residential mortgage loans.
loans where borrowers may be subject to payment increases include adjustable rate mortgage loans with terms that initially require payment of interest only.  payments may increase significantly when the interest-only period ends and the loan principal begins to amortize. at september 30, 2018 and 2017, these loans totaled $992 million and $683 million, respectively, or approximately 25% and 20% of the residential mortgage portfolio, respectively.  the weighted average number of years before the remainder of the loans, which were still in their interest-only period at september 30, 2018, begins amortizing is 6.6 years.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis a component of credit risk management for the residential portfolio is the ltv ratio and borrower credit score at origination or purchase. the following table details the most recent weighted-average ltv ratios and fico scores at origination of rj bank's residential first mortgage loan portfolio.
corporate and tax-exempt loans credit risk in rj bank's corporate and tax-exempt loan portfolios are monitored on an individual loan basis for trends in borrower operating performance, payment history, credit ratings, collateral performance, loan covenant compliance, semi-annual snc exam results, municipality demographics and other factors including industry performance and concentrations. as part of the credit review process, the loan grade is reviewed at least quarterly to confirm the appropriate risk rating for each credit. the individual loan ratings resulting from the snc exams are incorporated in rj bank's internal loan ratings when the ratings are received and if the snc rating is lower on an individual loan than rj bank's internal rating, the loan is downgraded. while rj bank considers historical snc exam results in its loan ratings methodology, differences between the snc exam and internal ratings on individual loans typically arise due to subjectivity of the loan classification process. these differences may result in additional provision for loan losses in periods when snc exam results are received. see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10-k, specifically the "bank loans, net" section, for additional information on rj bank's allowance for loan loss policies.
other than loans classified as nonperforming, there were no corporate and tax-exempt loans that were delinquent greater than 30 days at september 30, 2018.
credit risk is also managed by diversifying the corporate loan portfolio. rj bank's corporate loan portfolio does not contain a significant concentration in any single industry. the following table details the industry concentrations (top five categories) of rj bank's corporate loans.

liquidity risk see the section "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources" of this form 10-k for information regarding our liquidity and how we manage liquidity risk.
operational risk operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, business disruptions, improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in our technology or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in our control processes including cybersecurity incidents. see item 1a "risk factors" of this form 10-k for a discussion of certain cybersecurity risks. we operate different businesses in diverse markets and are reliant on the ability of our employees and systems to process a large number of transactions. these risks are less direct than credit and market risk, but managing them is critical, particularly in a rapidly changing environment with increasing transaction volumes and complexity. in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems or improper action by employees, we could suffer financial loss, regulatory sanctions and damage to our reputation. in order to mitigate and control operational risk, we have developed and continue to enhance specific policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels throughout the organization and within such departments as accounting, operations, information technology, legal, compliance, risk management and internal audit. these control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operational policies and procedures are being followed and that our various businesses are operating within established corporate policies and limits. business continuity plans exist for critical systems, and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate.
raymond james financial, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis we have an operational risk management committee comprised of members of senior management, which reviews and addresses operational risks across our businesses. the committee establishes, and from time-to-time will reassess, risk appetite levels for major operational risks, monitors operating unit performance for adherence to defined risk tolerances, and establishes policies for risk management at the enterprise level.
as more fully described in the discussion of our business technology risks included in various risk factors presented in item 1a "risk factors" of this form 10-k, despite our implementation of protective measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to human error, natural disasters, power loss, spam attacks, unauthorized access, distributed denial of service attacks, computer viruses and other malicious code and other events that could have an impact on the security and stability of our operations.  notwithstanding the precautions we take, if one or more of these events were to occur, this could jeopardize the information we confidentially maintain, including that of our clients and counterparties, which is processed, stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our clients or counterparties. to-date, we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches; however, there can be no assurances that we will not suffer such losses in the future.
model risk model risk refers to the possibility of unintended business outcomes arising from the design, implementation or use of models. models are used throughout the firm for a variety of purposes such as the valuation of financial instruments, assessing risk, stress testing, and to assist in the making of business decisions. model risk includes the potential risk that management makes incorrect decisions based upon either incorrect model results or incorrect understanding and use of model results. model risk may also occur when model output experiences a deviation from the expected result. model risk can result in significant financial loss, inaccurate financial or regulatory reporting, misaligned business strategies or damage to our reputation.
model risk management ("mrm") is a separate department within our risk management department and is independent of model owners, users, and developers. our model risk management framework consists primarily of model governance, maintaining the firm-wide model inventory, validating and approving all material models used across the firm, and on-going monitoring. results of validations and issues identified are reported to the enterprise risk management committee and the audit and risk committee of the board of directors. mrm assumes responsibility for the independent and effective challenge of model completeness, integrity and design based on intended use.
compliance risk compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or reputational damage that we may suffer from a failure to comply with applicable laws, external standards, or internal requirements.  our compliance department plays a key leadership role in the oversight, management, and mitigation of compliance risk throughout the firm, including through conducting an annual compliance risk assessment and monitoring and testing activities, implementing policies, training associates on compliance-related topics, and reporting compliance risk-related issues and metrics to the board of directors and senior management, among other activities.
our board of directors oversees the firm's management and mitigation of compliance risk, setting a culture that encourages ethical conduct and compliance throughout the firm.  senior management communicates and reinforces this culture.  our first line of defense, which includes all of our segments, is responsible for managing and mitigating compliance risk arising from its activities.  the second line of defense - which includes the compliance, legal, and risk management departments, including the anti-money laundering and financial crimes department - supports, oversees, and provides challenge to the first line of defense in its management and mitigation of compliance risk.  the third line of defense, internal audit, independently reviews activities conducted by the previous lines of defense to assess their management and mitigation of compliance risk, providing additional assurance to the board of directors and senior management with a view to enhancing our oversight, management, and mitigation of compliance risk.
the firm has a number of management-level committees through which compliance risk is overseen, managed, and mitigated.  these committees include the anti-money laundering oversight committee, compliance and standards committee, compliance risk and ethics committee, enterprise risk management committee, executive committee, new product approval committee, operational risk management committee, and supplier risk management committee.
we have significantly increased the number of associates who are dedicated to managing and mitigating compliance risk, including anti-money laundering-related matters.  we have also invested in technology to improve our associates' ability to monitor and detect compliance risk, including suspicious activities.  we will continue to devote significant resources to the expansion and support of the firm's framework for managing and mitigating compliance risk.

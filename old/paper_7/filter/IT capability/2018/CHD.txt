item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements.
overview our business we develop, manufacture and market a broad range of consumer household and personal care and specialty products focused on animal productivity, chemicals and cleaners.  we focus our consumer products marketing efforts principally on our 11 "power brands."  these well-recognized brand names include arm & hammer, used in multiple product categories such as baking soda, cat litter, carpet deodorization and laundry detergent; trojan condoms, lubricants and vibrators; oxiclean stain removers, cleaning solutions, laundry detergent and bleach alternatives; spinbrush battery-operated and manual toothbrushes;  first response home pregnancy and ovulation test kits; nair depilatories; orajel oral analgesic; xtra laundry detergent; l'il critters and vitafusion gummy dietary supplements, batiste dry shampoos and waterpik water flossers and replacement showerheads.
we sell our consumer products under a variety of brands through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets, mass merchandisers, wholesale clubs, drugstores, convenience stores, home stores, dollar, pet and other specialty stores and websites and other e-commerce channels, all of which sell the products to consumers. we sell our specialty products to industrial customers, livestock producers and through distributors.
we operate our business in three segments: consumer domestic, consumer international and spd.  the segments are based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures.   in 2018, the consumer domestic, consumer international and spd segments represented approximately 76%, 17% and 7%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.
2018 financial highlights key fiscal year 2018 financial results include:
•   2018 net sales grew 9.8% over fiscal year 2017, with gains in all three segments, primarily due to volume growth in consumer domestic and consumer international, helped in part by the august 2017 acquisition of waterpik and partially offset by volume declines in specialty products.
•   gross margin decreased 140 basis points to 44.4% in fiscal year 2018 from 45.8% in fiscal year 2017, primarily due to higher commodity, transportation and manufacturing costs.
•   operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 19.1% in fiscal year 2018 from 19.4% in fiscal year 2017, reflecting lower gross margin, partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses and lower marketing costs.
•   we reported diluted net earnings per share in fiscal year 2018 of $2.27, a decrease of approximately 21.7% from fiscal year 2017 diluted net earnings per share of $2.90. the prior year includes a one-time favorable adjustment of $1.06 associated with the tax cuts and jobs act.
•   cash provided by operations was $763.6, an $82.1 increase from the prior year, due to higher cash earnings and lower working capital.
strategic goals, challenges and initiatives our ability to generate sales depends on consumer demand for our products and retail customers' decisions to carry our products, which are, in part, affected by general economic conditions in our markets. although our consumer products generally are consumer staples and less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products, in 2018, many of the product categories in which we operate continued to experience pricing pressures, and weak or inconsistent consumer demand.  some customers have responded to economic conditions by increasing their private label offerings (primarily in the dietary supplements, diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories), and consolidating the product selections they offer to the top few leading brands in each category.  in
(dollars in millions, except share and per share data)
addition, an increasing portion of our product categories is being sold by club stores, dollar stores, mass merchandisers and internet-based retailers.  these factors have placed downward pressure on our sales and gross margins.
we expect a competitive marketplace in 2019 due to new product introductions by competitors and continuing competitive pricing pressures.  in this environment, we intend to continue to aggressively pursue several key strategic initiatives: maintain competitive marketing and trade spending, tightly control our cost structure, continue to develop and launch new and differentiated products, and pursue strategic acquisitions.  we also intend to continue to grow our product sales globally and maintain an offering of premium and value brand products to appeal to a wide range of consumers.
we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of laundry detergent. the continued customer demand for these products are critical to our future success.  as a result, any commercialization, delays or reduction of sales of these products, in the event that our diversification efforts discussed below are not successful, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. in addition, there continues to be significant product competition in the gummy vitamin category.  the category has grown from eight competitors to 30 in the last five years.  we continue to evaluate and vigorously combat these pressures through, among other things, new product introductions and increased marketing and trade spending. however, there is no assurance that the category will not decline in the future and that we will be able to offset any such decline.
we are continuously focused on strengthening our key brands, such as arm & hammer, oxiclean, trojan, l'il critters and vitafusion, batiste and waterpik, through the launch of innovative new products, which span various product categories, including premium and value household products supported by increased marketing and trade spending.  there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful.
in the domestic business, seven out of 11 "power brands" met or exceeded category growth for the full year 2018.  our global product portfolio consists of both premium (65% of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2018) and value (35% of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2018) brands, which we believe enables us to succeed in a range of economic environments.  we intend to continue to develop a portfolio of appealing new products to build loyalty among cost-conscious consumers.
over the past two decades, we have diversified from an almost exclusively u.s. business to a global company with approximately 18% of sales derived from foreign countries in 2018.  we have operations in seven countries (canada, mexico, u.k., france, germany, australia, and brazil) and export to over 130 other countries.  in 2018, we benefited from our expanded global footprint and expect to continue to focus on selectively expanding our global business.  if we are unable to expand our business internationally at the rate that we expect, we may not realize the operational benefits that we anticipate.
although we believe ongoing international expansion represents a significant opportunity to grow our business, our increasing activity in global markets exposes us to additional complexity and uncertainty.  net sales generated outside of the u.s. are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as political uncertainty which could impact future operating results.  moreover, the current domestic and international political environment, including existing and potential changes to u.s. policies related to global trade and tariffs, have resulted in uncertainty regarding the global economy. the impact of u.s. tariffs, primarily on waterpik products, was a component of increased cost of sale during the year ended december 31, 2018. the implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we manufacture or sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we also continue to focus on controlling our costs.  historically, we have been able to mitigate the effects of cost increases primarily by implementing cost reduction programs and, to a lesser extent, by passing along some of these cost increases to customers.  we have also entered into set pricing and pre-buying arrangements with certain suppliers and hedge agreements for diesel fuel. to combat higher input costs and tariffs, in 2018, we announced price increases on approximately 30% of our portfolio. should additional price increases be warranted, we cannot be certain they will be accepted by our customers. additionally, maintaining tight controls on overhead costs has been a hallmark of ours and has enabled us to effectively navigate recent challenging economic conditions.
the identification and integration of strategic acquisitions are an important component of our overall strategy and product category diversification.  acquisitions have added significantly to our sales and profits and product category diversification over the last decade.  this is recently evidenced by our 2015 acquisition of certain assets of varied industries corporation (the "vi-cor acquisition"), 2016 acquisitions of spencer forrest, inc., the maker of toppik (the "toppik acquisition"), and the anusol and rectinol businesses from johnson & johnson (the "anusol acquisition") and 2017 acquisitions of viviscal from lifes2good holdings limited (the "viviscal acquisition"), agro biosciences, inc. (the "agro acquisition"), waterpik from pik holdings, inc. (the "waterpik acquisition"), and 2018 acquisition of passport food safety solutions, inc. (the "passport acquisition").   however, the failure to effectively integrate any acquisition or achieve expected synergies may cause us to incur material asset write-downs.  we actively seek acquisitions that fit our guidelines, and our strong financial position provides us with
(dollars in millions, except share and per share data)
flexibility to take advantage of acquisition opportunities.  in addition, our ability to quickly integrate acquisitions and leverage existing infrastructure has enabled us to establish a strong track record in making accretive acquisitions.  since 2001, we have acquired 10 of our 11 "power brands".
we believe we are positioned to meet the ongoing challenges described above due to our strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on key strategic initiatives: maintaining competitive marketing and trade spending, managing our cost structure, continuing to develop and launch new and differentiated products, and pursuing strategic acquisitions.  this focus, together with the strength of our portfolio of premium and value brands, has enabled us to succeed in a range of economic environments, and is expected to position us to continue to increase stockholder value over the long-term.  moreover, the generation of a significant amount of cash from operations, as a result of net income and effective working capital management, combined with an investment grade credit rating provides us with the financial flexibility to pursue acquisitions, drive new product development, make capital expenditures to support organic growth and gross margin improvements, return cash to stockholders through dividends and  share buy backs, and reduce outstanding debt, positioning us to continue to create stockholder value.
for information regarding risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, see "risk factors" in item 1a of this annual report.
recent developments accelerated share repurchase program in december of 2017, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase ("asr") contract with a commercial bank to purchase $200.0 of our common stock.  in the first quarter of 2018, we settled the asr contract and purchased approximately 4.1 million shares of common stock for $200.0, of which approximately $110.0 was purchased under the evergreen share repurchase program and $90.0 was purchased under the 2017 share repurchase program.  as a result of our purchases, there remained $310.0 of share repurchase availability under the 2017 share repurchase program as of december 31, 2018.
in connection with the evergreen repurchase program, in january 2019, we executed open market purchases of $100.0 of our common stock.
passport acquisition on march 8, 2018, we purchased passport food safety solutions, inc. ("passport").  passport sells products for pre-and post-harvest treatment of poultry, swine, and beef.  the total purchase price was approximately $50.0, which is subject to an additional payment of up to $25.0 based on sales performance through 2020.  passport's annual sales were approximately $21.0 in 2017.  the passport acquisition was funded with short-term borrowings and is managed in the spd segment.
(dollars in millions, except share and per share data)
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (gaap).  the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  by their nature, these judgments are subject to uncertainty.  they are based on our historical experience, our observation of trends in industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate.  our significant accounting policies and estimates are described below.
revenue recognition and promotional and sales return reserves virtually all of our revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when received or picked up by our customers.  the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date.  promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives, such as coupons to consumers, and sales incentives provided to customers (such as slotting, cooperative advertising, incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers).  all such costs are netted against sales.  slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer.  cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for our products.  discounts relating to price reduction arrangements and coupons are recorded when the related sale takes place.  costs associated with end-aisle or other in-store displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold.  we rely on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves.  for example, we use historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements.  based on the total face value of consumer domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years, if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 0.1% from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements, a difference of approximately $3.1 in the reserve required for coupons would result.  with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns, we use experience-based estimates, customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required.  if our estimates for promotional activities and sales returns reserves were to change by 10% the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately $6.4.  while management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made, estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations.  reserve adjustments made in 2018, 2017 and 2016 are immaterial relative to the amount of trade promotion expense incurred annually by us.
impairment of goodwill, trade names and other intangible assets carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived tradenames are reviewed periodically for possible impairment.  finite intangible assets are assessed when there are business triggering events.  our impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume, revenue and expense growth rates, and the selection of an appropriate discount rate.  management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions.  with respect to goodwill, impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit.  for trade names and other intangible assets, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which represents the estimated fair value of the asset.  judgment is required in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations.  indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change, distribution losses, or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired.  the result of our annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying values of all reporting units.  in addition, there were no goodwill impairment charges for each of the years in the three-year period ended december 31, 2018.
fair value for indefinite lived intangible assets was estimated based on a "relief from royalty" or "excess earnings" discounted cash flow method, which contains numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change, and therefore could impact fair values in the future.  we determined that the fair value of all other intangible assets for each of the years in the three-year period ended december 31, 2018 exceeded their respective carrying values based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability. in 2017 there was a personal care trade name that, based on recent performance, had experienced sales and profit declines that had eroded a significant portion of the excess between fair and carrying value, which could potentially result in an impairment of the asset.  in 2017, this excess had been reduced due in large part to an increased competitive market environment therefore resulting in reduced cash flow projections. the performance of the tradename improved in 2018, thereby increasing the excess between fair value and carrying value.  this indefinite-lived intangible asset could still be susceptible to impairment risk. while management can and has implemented strategies to address the risk, significant changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of this asset.
(dollars in millions, except share and per share data)
it is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if, for example, (i) the businesses or brands do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in 2018 or future years vary from current assumptions (including changes in discount rates), (iii) business conditions or strategies change from current assumptions, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and ebitda.  a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered "more likely than not" to be realized.  we record liabilities for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions under u.s. gaap guidelines.  the liabilities relate to tax return positions that, although supportable by us, may be challenged by the tax authorities and do not meet the minimum recognition threshold required under applicable accounting guidance for the related tax benefit to be recognized in the income statement.  we adjust this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation, interpretations of laws by courts, rulings by tax authorities, changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations.  many of the judgments involved in adjusting the liability involve assumptions and estimates that are highly uncertain and subject to change.  in this regard, settlement of any issue, or an adverse determination in litigation, with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in our annual tax rate.  conversely, favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate.

results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016
the discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level presented below is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment.  the discussion of our consolidated results of operations and segment operating results is presented on a historical basis for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.  the segment discussion also addresses certain product line information.  our operating units are consistent with our reportable segments.
twelve months ended            change vs.       twelve months ended
gross profit                                                  $1,840.8                    6.4%                $1,729.6
marketing expenses                                              $483.2                    6.4%                  $454.2
net sales net sales for the year ended december 31, 2018 were $4,145.9, an increase of $369.7, or 9.8% compared to 2017 net sales.  the components of the net sales increase are as follows:
foreign exchange rate fluctuations / other                                    0.1   %
volume from acquired product lines (net of divestiture) (1)                   5.4   %
(1)   on march 8, 2018, we completed the passport acquisition. on january 17, 2017, we completed the viviscal acquisition. on may 1, 2017, we completed the agro acquisition. on august 7, 2017, we completed the waterpik acquisition. net sales of these acquisitions are included in our results since the dates of acquisition. in march 2017, we sold our chemical business in brazil.
the volume change primarily reflects increased product sales in both the consumer domestic and consumer international segments, with volume declines in specialty products. all three segments experienced favorable price/product mix.
our gross profit for 2018 was $1,840.8, a $111.2 increase compared to 2017.  gross margin was 44.4% in 2018 compared to 45.8% in 2017, a 140 basis points ("bps") decrease.  the decrease is due to the impact of higher commodity costs and transportation costs of 170 bps and higher manufacturing costs of 80 bps, partially offset by productivity programs of 80 bps, favorable volume price/product mix of 20 bps, and the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates of 10 bps.
operating costs marketing expenses for 2018 were $483.2, an increase of $29.0 compared to 2017.  acquired businesses contributed modestly to the increase.  marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 bps to 11.7% in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to 100 bps of leverage on higher net sales partially offset by 70 bps on higher expenses.
selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") expenses for 2018 were $565.9, an increase of $23.2 or 4.3% compared to 2017.  the prior year includes the $39.2 international pension settlement charge.  the increase is primarily due to transition and ongoing acquisition-related costs, higher compensation, information system (in part in support of new technologies and security
(dollars in millions, except share and per share data)
upgrades) and r&d costs.  sg&a as a percentage of net sales decreased 80 bps to 13.6% in 2018 compared to 14.4% in 2017.  the decrease is due to 130 bps of leverage associated with higher sales, partially offset by higher costs of 50 bps. the comparison is helped by approximately 100 bps associated with the 2017 pension settlement charge.
other income and expenses equity in earnings of affiliates decreased by $1.6 in 2018 as compared to 2017.  the decrease in earnings during 2018 was due primarily to lower dcad sales.
other expense increased by $3.6 in 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily due to the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates.
interest expense in 2018 was $79.4, an increase of $26.8 compared to 2017 primarily due to a higher amount of average debt outstanding associated with the $1,425.0 aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued on july 25, 2017.
taxation the 2018 tax rate was 21.0% compared to -7.3% in 2017.  the 2017 tax rate was positively impacted by 39.4% as a result of the tax act, which lowered the u.s. corporate income tax rate to 21% starting in 2018 and resulted in a negative tax rate for 2017.
net sales net sales for the year ended december 31, 2017 were $3,776.2, an increase of $283.1, or 8.1% compared to 2016 net sales.  the components of the net sales increase are as follows:
(1)   on january 17, 2017, we completed the viviscal acquisition, on may 1, 2017, we completed the agro acquisition and on august 7, 2017, we completed the waterpik acquisition. net sales of these acquisitions are included in our results since the dates of acquisition. in march 2017, we sold our chemical business in brazil.
all three segments reported volume increases. both consumer domestic and consumer international experienced unfavorable price/product mix.
our gross profit for 2017 was $1,729.6, a $139.0 increase compared to 2016.  gross margin was 45.8% in 2017 compared to 45.5% in 2016, a 30 bps increase.  the increase was due to the impact of higher margins on acquired businesses representing 80 bps, favorable volume of 70 bps, and lower manufacturing costs of 40 bps, partially offset by unfavorable price/product mix of 140 bps (primarily due to higher promotion and coupon costs), higher commodity costs of 30 bps, and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates of 10 bps.  gross margin in 2016 included a plant impairment charge of 20 bps at an international subsidiary.
operating costs marketing expenses for 2017 were $454.2, an increase of $27.0 compared to 2016.  acquired businesses contributed modestly to the increase.  marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 bps to 12.0% in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to 90 bps of leverage on higher net sales partially offset by 70 bps on higher expenses.
(dollars in millions, except share and per share data)
sg&a expenses for 2017 were $542.7, an increase of $103.5 or 23.6% compared to 2016.  the increase was primarily due to the $39.2 international pension settlement charge, transition and ongoing acquisition-related costs, higher information system and legal costs and costs associated with selling the chemical business in brazil.  sg&a as a percentage of net sales increased 180 bps to 14.4% in 2017 compared to 12.6% in 2016.  the increase was due to higher costs of 280 bps, partially offset by 100 bps of leverage associated with higher sales. the pension charge contributed 110 bps to the increase.
other income and expenses equity in earnings of affiliates increased by $1.6 in 2017 as compared to 2016.  the increase in earnings during 2017 was due primarily to profit improvement from armand products due to lower raw material costs.
interest expense in 2017 was $52.6, an increase of $24.9 compared to 2016 due to a higher amount of average debt outstanding associated with the $1,425.0 aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued on july 25, 2017.
taxation the 2017 tax rate was -7.3% compared to 35.0% in 2016.  the 2017 tax rate was positively impacted by 39.4% as a result of the tax act and 2.2% related to the adoption of the new accounting standard which modifies how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees.  previously, this tax benefit related to the adoption of the new accounting standard was accounted for in our stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet.  starting in 2017, the tax benefit has been accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense.
segment results for 2018, 2017 and 2016
we operate three reportable segments: consumer domestic, consumer international and spd.  these segments are determined based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures.  we also have a corporate segment.
consumer domestic        household and personal care products consumer international   primarily personal care products spd                      specialty chemical products the corporate segment income consists of equity in earnings of affiliates.  as of december 31, 2018, we held 50% ownership interests in each of armand and armakleen, respectively.  our equity in earnings of armand and armakleen for the year ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are included in the corporate segment.
(dollars in millions, except share and per share data)
some of the subsidiaries that are included in the consumer international segment manufacture and sell personal care products to the consumer domestic segment.  these sales are eliminated from the consumer international segment results set forth below.
segment net sales and income before income taxes for each of the three years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:

(1)   intersegment sales from consumer international to consumer domestic, which are not reflected in the table, were $5.7, $4.5 and $3.4 for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
(2)   in determining income before income taxes, interest expense, investment earnings and certain aspects of other income and expense were allocated among segments based upon each segment's relative income from operations.
(3)   corporate segment consists of equity in earnings of affiliates from armand and armakleen in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
product line revenues for external customers for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:
total consumer domestic                   3,129.9              2,854.9              2,677.8

household products include deodorizing, cleaning and laundry products.  personal care products include condoms, pregnancy kits, oral care products, skin care products, hair care products and gummy dietary supplements.
consumer domestic
consumer domestic net sales in 2018 were $3,129.9, an increase of $275.0 or 9.6% compared to net sales of $2,854.9 in 2017.  the components of the net sales change are the following:
net sales - consumer domestic         december 31, 2018
(1)   includes net sales of the brands acquired in the viviscal acquisition and the waterpik acquisition since the date of acquisition.
the increase in net sales for 2018 reflects the impact of acquisitions and higher sales of arm & hammer liquid and unit dose detergents, arm & hammer cat litter, batiste dry shampoo, oxiclean stain fighters and gummy vitamins, partially offset by lower sales of kaboom cleaning products.
(dollars in millions, except share and per share data)
there continues to be significant product competition in the gummy vitamin category.  the category has grown from eight competitors to 30 in the last five years.  we continue to evaluate and vigorously combat these pressures through, among other things, new product introductions and increased marketing and trade spending.  however, there is no assurance this category will not decline in the future and that we will be able to offset any such decline.
consumer domestic income before income taxes for 2018 was $577.2, a $29.2 decrease as compared to 2017.  the decrease is due primarily to the impact of higher sg&a costs of $56.1, unfavorable commodity and manufacturing costs of $49.6, higher interest and other expenses of $22.5, higher marketing expenses of $19.3 and unfavorable price/product mix of $11.8, partially offset by higher sales volumes of $130.3.
consumer domestic net sales in 2017 were $2,854.9, an increase of $177.1 or 6.6% compared to net sales of $2,677.8 in 2016.  the components of the net sales change are the following:
net sales - consumer domestic         december 31, 2017
(1)   includes net sales of the brands acquired in the viviscal acquisition and the waterpik acquisition since the dates of acquisition.
the increase in net sales for 2017, reflects the impact of acquisitions, higher sales of arm & hammer liquid and unit dose detergents, batiste dry shampoo, oxiclean stain fighters and arm & hammer cat litter, partially offset by lower sales of trojan condoms, xtra laundry detergent and gummy vitamins.
there was significant product and price competition in the premium and deep value laundry detergent categories and more recently, product competition in the gummy vitamin category.   for example, in the laundry detergent category, p&g and henkel, the two largest laundry detergent companies in the u.s., were engaged in aggressive pricing promotions, and retailers were de-emphasizing the deep value tier of laundry detergents, which is where xtra competes.  in addition, the gummy vitamin category has grown from eight competitors to 30 in the last five years.  we continue to evaluate and vigorously combat these pressures through, among other things, new product introductions and increased marketing and trade spending.  however, there is no assurance that the categories will not decline in the future and that we will be able to offset any such decline.
consumer domestic income before income taxes for 2017 was $606.4, a $15.8 increase as compared to 2016.  the increase was due primarily to the impact of higher sales volumes of $146.5 and favorable commodity and manufacturing costs of $15.1, partially offset by unfavorable price/product mix of $90.5, higher marketing expenses of $18.9, higher interest expense of $20.7, and higher sg&a costs of $15.8.

liquidity and capital resources on march 29, 2018, we replaced our former $1,000.0 unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to terminate on december 4, 2020 with a new $1,000.0 unsecured revolving credit facility (the "credit agreement").  under the credit agreement, we have the ability to increase our borrowing up to an additional $600.0, subject to lender commitments and certain conditions as described in the credit agreement.  borrowings under the credit agreement are available for general corporate purposes and are used to support our $1,000.0 commercial paper program.  unless extended, the credit agreement will terminate and all amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on march 29, 2023.
as of december 31, 2018, we had $316.7 in cash and cash equivalents, and approximately $997.0 available through the revolving facility under our credit agreement and our commercial paper program.  to preserve our liquidity, we invest cash primarily in government money market funds, prime money market funds, short-term commercial paper and short-term bank deposits.
as a result of the tax act, we repatriated excess cash held at our foreign subsidiaries in 2018. we repatriated approximately $150.0 of the $194.0 that was held outside the u.s as of december 31, 2017.  for 2019, we estimate that we will repatriate approximately $35.0 of the $68.0 held outside the u.s as of december 31, 2018.
we financed the waterpik acquisition with a portion of the proceeds from an underwritten public offering of $1,425.0 aggregate principal amount of senior notes completed on july 25, 2017, consisting of $300.0 aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2019, $300.0 aggregate principal amount of 2.45% senior notes due 2022, $425.0 aggregate principal amount of
(dollars in millions, except share and per share data)
3.15% senior notes due 2027 and $400.0 aggregate principal amount of 3.95% senior notes due 2047 (collectively, the "senior notes").  the floating rate senior notes, which matured and were repaid in full with cash on hand and commercial paper on january 25, 2019, bore interest at a rate, reset quarterly, equal to three-month u.s. dollar london interbank offered rate ("libor") plus 0.15%.
the current economic environment presents risks that could have adverse consequences for our liquidity.  see "unfavorable economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products" under "risk factors" in item 1a of this annual report.  we do not anticipate that current economic conditions will adversely affect our ability to comply with the financial covenant in the credit agreement because we currently are, and anticipate that we will continue to be, in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio requirement under the credit agreement.
on november 1, 2017, the board authorized a new share repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to $500.0 in shares of common stock (the "2017 share repurchase program").  the 2017 share repurchase program does not have an expiration and replaced the 2016 share repurchase program.  we also continued our evergreen share repurchase program, authorized by the board on january 29, 2014, under which we may repurchase, from time to time, common stock to reduce or eliminate dilution associated with issuances of common stock under our incentive plans.
in december of 2017, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase ("asr") contract with a commercial bank to purchase $200.0 of common stock.  in the first quarter of 2018, we settled the asr contract and purchased approximately 4.1 million shares of common stock for $200.0, of which approximately $110.0 was purchased under the evergreen share repurchase program and $90.0 was purchased under the 2017 share repurchase program.  as a result of our purchases, there remained $310.0 of share repurchase availability under the 2017 share repurchase program as of december 31, 2018.
in connection with the evergreen repurchase program, in january 2019, we executed open market purchases of $100.0 of our common stock.
we anticipate that our cash from operations, together with our current borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure program costs, which are expected to be approximately $85.0 in 2018, fund our share repurchase programs to the extent implemented by management, pay the upcoming maturing notes and pay dividends at the latest approved rate.  cash, together with our current borrowing capacity, may be used for acquisitions that would complement our existing product lines or geographic markets.  we did not have any mandatory fixed rate debt principal payments in 2018.  we paid the $300.0 floating rate senior notes that matured on january 25, 2019 with cash on hand and commercial paper. the $300.0 senior notes (2.45%) will mature on december 15, 2019 and will be repaid with cash on hand plus if necessary, available borrowings.

(dollars in millions, except share and per share data)
net cash provided by operating activities - our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow provided by operating activities, which is dependent on the level of net income and changes in working capital.  our net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 increased by $82.1 to $763.6 as compared to $681.5 in 2017 due to higher cash earnings (net income plus non-cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization, non-cash compensation and asset impairment charges) and lower working capital.  the change in working capital is primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and lower other current assets partially offset by higher inventories.  we measure working capital effectiveness based on our cash conversion cycle.  the following table presents our cash conversion cycle information for the quarters ended december 31, 2018 and 2017:
december 31, 2018           december 31, 2017      change days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable ("dso")                    30                          31          (1   )
our cash conversion cycle (defined as the sum of dso and dio less dpo) at december 31, 2018, which is calculated using a two period average method, increased 4 days from the prior year amount of 18 days to 22 days at december 31, 2018 due primarily to an increase in dio of six days. dpo increased one day from 65 to 66 days, and dso decreased one day from 31 to 30 days.  the increase in the cash conversion cycle is primarily due a certain recent acquisition, which currently requires a higher level of working capital. we continue to focus on reducing our working capital requirements.

taxes the company's effective tax rate increased to 39.2% in 2017 compared to 35.8% in 2016, due primarily to the effects of the tcja in 2017, a one-time tax event in 2016 and differences in state and foreign income taxes. the estimated impact of the enactment of the tcja was an $11.6 million increase to tax expense, which was a direct decrease to net income. the $11.6 million increase in tax was as follows: $8.0 million from transition tax on foreign earnings, $2.9 million from the revaluation of deferred tax assets, and $0.7 million from reductions in tax benefits on stock compensation. the increase due to the tcja was partially offset by a reduction related to the implementation of asu 2016-09 that was a $4.0 million benefit.

critical accounting policies the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require management's most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows:
accrual for termite contracts-the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company's business practices. however, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims. accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the company's consolidated statements of financial position.
accrued insurance-the company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers' compensation and vehicle liability. the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. the company contracts with an independent third party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management's knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. management's judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. the company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims. initiatives that have been implemented include pre-employment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, pre-hire, random and post-accident drug testing, increased driver training and a post-injury nurse triage program for employees.
revenue recognition- the company's revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, each of which are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
more on the company's revenue recognition policy can be found in the company's notes to the consolidated financial statements, note 1., summary of significant accounting policies with the heading revenue recognition.
contingency accruals-the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. in accordance with the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 450 "contingencies," management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation. estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. however, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company's financial condition or results of operations. contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the company's consolidated statements of financial position.
defined benefit pension plans - in 2005, the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the rollins, inc. defined benefit plan, although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through june 2005. the company also includes the waltham services, llc hourly employee pension plan to the company's financial statements. waltham services, llc hourly employees pension plan was amended, effective september 1, 2018, to freeze future benefit accruals for all participants. the company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with the fasb asc topic 715 "compensation- retirement benefits", and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. with the assistance of the actuary, the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.
the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes, the investments strategy, and the views of our investment adviser. differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years. therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains or losses ultimately affects future pension expense. the company's assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 7.0% which is unchanged from the prior year.
in regards to the rollins, inc. defined benefit plan the company utilizes a termination liability approach. this approach reflects the estimated impact of the distribution of benefits due to a standard termination. plan liabilities will be settled through the purchase of annuities from an insurance provider or through the distribution of lump sum payments to eligible participants that elect to receive such a form of payment. discount rates of 3.90% per year for participants in pay status and 4.11% per year for participants with deferred benefits were selected by the plan sponsor to determine the benefit obligation resulting from plan termination annuity purchases. the discount rates reflect the single effective interest rate that produces the same present value as that produced when the expected future cash flows for participants expected to elect an annuity are discounted with the ftse yield curve (formerly citigroup) as of the measurement date. to determine the benefit obligation resulting from plan termination lump sum payments, the expected future cash flows for lump sum eligible participants, determined with the irc 417(e) mortality table for 2019, were discounted with the irc 417(e) segment interest rates for the month of november 2018 (3.43%, 4.46%, and 4.88%). only 50% of active, 30% of deferred vested, and 25% of retired participants that will be eligible to receive a lump sum distribution of their pension benefit upon plan termination, are assumed to elect this form of payment.
i)      3.90%, based on current market conditions, for participants in pay status expected to elect a plan termination annuity,
ii)    4.11%, based on current market conditions, for active and terminated participants with deferred benefits expected to elect a plan termination annuity, iii)    the irc 417(e) interest rates for the month of november 2018 (3.43%, 4.46%, and 4.88), based on plan provisions, for all lump sum eligible expected to elect a plan termination lump sum.
waltham services, llc hourly employees pension plan utilizes a yield curve approach. the approach utilizes an economic model whereby the company's expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecast and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year. the economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds. the discount rate was 4.05% as of december 31, 2018 compared to 4.05% in 2017 and 4.35% in 2016. a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation.
as set forth in note 16 to the company's financial statements, included among the asset categories for the plan's investments are real estate, and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds. these investments are categorized as investments at net asset value ("nav") and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value. in accordance with accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2009-12 "investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent)," these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. the company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds' judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds' financial statements for reasonableness.
as of december 31, 2018, the defined benefit plans were fully-funded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders' equity by $14.8 million before tax and $11.0 million after tax.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein.
pharmaceutical distribution services segment the pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment distributes a comprehensive offering of brand-name, specialty brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, outsourced compounded sterile preparations, and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers, including acute care hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies, medical clinics, long-term care and alternate site pharmacies, and other customers. through a number of operating businesses, the pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment provides pharmaceutical distribution (including plasma and other blood products, injectible pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and other specialty pharmaceutical products) and additional services to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially oncology, and to other healthcare providers, including hospitals and dialysis clinics. additionally, the pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment provides data analytics, outcomes research, and additional services for biotechnology and pharmaceutical manufacturers. the pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment also provides pharmacy management, staffing and additional consulting services, and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers. additionally, it delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers.
abcs, through a number of operating businesses, provides a full suite of integrated manufacturer services that range from clinical trial support to product post-approval and commercialization support. world courier, which operates in over 50 countries, is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry. mwi is a leading animal health distribution company in the united states and in the united kingdom. mwi sells pharmaceuticals, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, micro feed ingredients, and various other products to customers in both the companion animal and production animal markets. additionally, mwi offers demand-creating sales force services to manufacturers.
•   pharmaceutical distribution services' gross profit increased 8.9% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in revenue, the january 2018 consolidation of profarma distribuidora de produtos farmacêuticos s.a. ("profarma"), a leading pharmaceutical wholesaler in brazil (see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements), and the january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith, offset in part by a lower contribution from our pharmaceutical compounding operations as it shipped fewer units as we voluntarily suspended production in december 2017 at our memphis facility pending execution of certain remedial measures. we have been in active communication with the fda and the consumer protection branch of the civil division of the doj regarding our ongoing compliance efforts at pharmedium, and representatives of the company and pharmedium have had an initial meeting with the doj and the fda to discuss potential resolution of ongoing matters and whether a consent decree is necessary (see item 1a. risk factors on page 8). further discussions are anticipated, including with regard to the possible entry of a consent decree. gross profit in other increased 4.6% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to world courier and the january 2018 consolidation of the specialty joint venture in brazil (see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements), offset in part by lower gross profit at abcs, specifically the lash consulting group. total gross profit in the current fiscal year was negatively impacted by an increase in last-in, first-out ("lifo") expense in comparison to the prior fiscal year;
•   distribution, selling, and administrative expenses increased 15.6% from the prior fiscal year as the pharmaceutical distribution services' segment expenses increased by 19.4% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the january 2018 consolidation of profarma, the january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith, and the duplicate costs resulting from the implementation of new information technology systems. distribution, selling, and administrative expenses in other increased by 8.2% in the current fiscal year primarily to support its revenue growth, the january 2018 consolidation of the specialty joint venture in brazil, and due to duplicate costs resulting from the implementation of new information technology systems;
•   operating income increased 36.2% in the current fiscal year primarily due to the decrease in employee severance, litigation, and other costs as we incurred significant litigation settlement charges in the prior fiscal year, offset in part by an increase in distribution, selling, and administration expenses and an increase in lifo expense in the current fiscal year;
•   our effective tax rates were (37.2)% and 60.3% in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 was primarily impacted by the effect of the tax cuts and jobs act (the "2017 tax act"). our total income tax benefit in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 of $438.5 million reflects $612.6 million of tax benefits recognized and a reduction in the u.s. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, both resulting from the 2017 tax act. additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, a portion of a 2017 legal settlement charge was determined to be deductible, which favorably impacted our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018. we expect that the federal corporate tax rate reduction as a result of the 2017 tax act will continue to favorably impact our effective tax rate compared to prior periods through fiscal 2019. the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 was negatively impacted by non-deductible legal settlement charges. our effective tax rates for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018 and 2017 were favorably impacted by our international businesses in switzerland and ireland, which have lower income tax rates, and the benefit from stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting; and
we currently expect our revenue growth percentage to be in the mid-single digits in fiscal 2019. our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors, such as industry growth trends, including drug utilization, the introduction of new innovative brand therapies (including biosimilars), the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers and the rate of conversion from brand products to those generic drugs, price increases and price deflation, general economic conditions in the united states, competition within the industry, customer consolidation, changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices, increased downward pressure on government and other third-party reimbursement rates to our customers, and changes in federal government rules and regulations.
the pharmaceutical distribution services segment grew its revenue by 9.7% from the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the growth of some of its largest customers, overall market growth, and especially strong oncology product sales. in addition, revenue increased in the current fiscal year due to the january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith and the january 2018 consolidation of profarma.
revenue in other increased 10.2% from the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the january 2018 consolidation of the specialty joint venture in brazil, abcs's growth in its canadian operations, and increased revenue from mwi and world courier, offset in part by a decrease in revenue at abcs's lash consulting group.
a number of our contracts with customers, including group purchasing organizations ("gpo"), are typically subject to expiration each year. we may lose a significant customer if any existing contract with such customer expires without being extended, renewed, or replaced. during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018, no significant contracts expired. over the next twelve months, there are no significant contracts scheduled to expire. additionally, from time to time, other significant contracts may be renewed prior to their expiration dates. if those contracts are renewed at less favorable terms, they may also negatively impact our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.

gross profit increased 1.5%, or $66.3 million, from the prior fiscal year. gross profit in the current fiscal year was favorably impacted by increases in gross profit in pharmaceutical distribution services and other and an increase in gains from antitrust litigation settlements. gross profit was negatively impacted by an increase in lifo expense in comparison to the prior fiscal year, pharmedium remediation costs, and an estimated assessment related to the new york state opioid stewardship act.
our costs of goods sold includes a lifo provision that is affected by manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences, changes in inventory quantities, and product mix, many of which are difficult to predict. changes to any of the above factors may have a material impact to our annual lifo provision. lifo expense in the current fiscal year was primarily driven by lower generic deflation and lower generic inventory levels, offset in part by lower brand inflation in comparison to the prior fiscal year.
after fda inspections of our compounding facilities, we voluntarily suspended production activities in december 2017 at our largest compounding facility located in memphis, tennessee pending execution of certain remedial measures. the suspension of this production facility negatively impacted gross profit in the current fiscal year. we have been in active communication with the fda and the consumer protection branch of the civil division of the doj regarding our ongoing compliance efforts at pharmedium, and representatives of the company and pharmedium have had an initial meeting with the doj and the fda to discuss potential resolution of ongoing matters and whether a consent decree is necessary (see item 1a. risk factors on page 8). further discussions are anticipated, including with regard to the possible entry of a consent decree.
new york state ("nys") enacted the opioid stewardship act ("osa"), which went into effect on july 1, 2018. the osa established an annual $100 million opioid stewardship fund (the "fund") and requires manufacturers, distributors, and importers licensed in nys to ratably source the fund. the ratable share of the assessment for each licensee is based upon opioids sold or distributed to or within nys. the initial payment to nys is due on january 1, 2019 for opioids sold or distributed during calendar year 2017, and future assessments, beginning with the 2018 calendar year, will be payable quarterly beginning on april 1, 2019. the osa expires on june 30, 2024. in september 2018, we accrued $22.0 million as an estimate of our liability under the osa for the period from january 1, 2017 through september 30, 2018.
pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit increased 8.9%, or $284.1 million, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in revenue, the january 2018 consolidation of profarma, and the january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith, offset in part by a lower contribution from our pharmaceutical compounding operations as it shipped fewer units as we voluntarily suspended production in december 2017 at our memphis facility. as a percentage of revenue, pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit margin of 2.14% in the current fiscal year decreased 2 basis points from the prior fiscal year. the decrease in gross profit margin from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a lower contribution from our pharmaceutical compounding operations and due to increased sales to our larger customers, which typically have lower gross profit margins, offset in part by the january 2018 consolidation of profarma and the january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith.
gross profit in other increased 4.6%, or $55.9 million, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to world courier and the january 2018 consolidation of the specialty joint venture in brazil, offset in part by lower gross profit at abcs, specifically the lash consulting group. as a percentage of revenue, gross profit margin in other of 19.90% in the current fiscal year decreased from 20.96% in the prior fiscal year. the decline in gross profit margin from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the decrease in gross profit margin at abcs, specifically the lash consulting group.
we recognized gains from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers of $35.9 million and $1.4 million during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold (see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements).
employee severance, litigation, and other             183,520                   959,327
distribution, selling, and administrative expenses increased 15.6%, or $331.6 million, from the prior fiscal year as the pharmaceutical distribution services' segment expenses increased by 19.4% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the january 2018 consolidation of profarma, the january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith, and the duplicate costs resulting from the implementation of new information technology systems. distribution, selling, and administrative expenses in other increased by 8.2% in the current fiscal year primarily to support its revenue growth, the january 2018 consolidation of the specialty joint venture in brazil, and due to duplicate costs resulting from the implementation of new information technology systems. as a percentage of revenue, distribution, selling, and administrative expenses were 1.46% in the current fiscal year, and represents a 7 basis point
depreciation expense increased 19.8% from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in the amount of property and equipment placed into service relating to our distribution infrastructure and various technology assets. amortization expense increased 12.9% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets originating from our january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith and the january 2018 consolidation of profarma.
employee severance, litigation, and other in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 included $36.7 million of employee severance costs primarily related to position eliminations resulting from our business transformation efforts and restructuring activities related to our consulting business. litigation costs were $61.5 million in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 and primarily related to opioid lawsuits, investigations, and related initiatives. other costs in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 included $33.9 million of acquisition-related deal and integration costs, $33.0 million of other costs related to our business transformation efforts, and $18.4 million of other restructuring initiatives.
employee severance, litigation, and other in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 included $7.8 million of employee severance costs primarily related to position eliminations as we began to reorganize to further align our organization to our customers' needs. litigation costs were $917.6 million in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 and primarily related to litigation settlements and accruals. other costs in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 included $17.0 million of acquisition-related deal and integration costs, $13.3 million of other restructuring initiatives, and $3.7 million related to our business transformation efforts.
we recorded a $59.7 million goodwill impairment charge at our profarma reporting unit in connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment.

segment operating income is evaluated excluding gain from antitrust litigation settlements; lifo (expense) credit; pharmedium remediation costs; new york state opioid stewardship act; acquisition-related intangibles amortization; employee severance, litigation, and other; and goodwill impairment.
pharmaceutical distribution services operating income decreased 1.0%, or $16.9 million, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to an increase in operating expenses, offset in part by an increase in gross profit. as a percentage of revenue, pharmaceutical distribution services operating income margin decreased 10 basis points from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a lower contribution from our pharmaceutical compounding operations as it shipped fewer units as we voluntarily suspended production in december 2017 at our memphis facility.
interest expense, net increased 20.3%, or $29.5 million, from the prior fiscal year. the increase in interest expense, net from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the december 2017 issuance of senior notes to finance our january 2018 acquisition of h.d. smith and the january 2018 consolidation of profarma's debt and related interest expense. average borrowings increased by $519.8 million in the current fiscal year in comparison to the prior fiscal year.
our interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings, interest rates, amendments to our current borrowing facilities, and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash.
in connection with our incremental brazil investments, we adjusted the carrying values of our previously held equity interests in profarma and the specialty joint venture to equal their fair values. the adjustments resulted in a loss of $42.3 million, which was comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive loss of $45.9 million, a $12.4 million gain on the remeasurement of profarma's previously held interest, and an $8.8 million loss on the remeasurement of the specialty joint venture's previously held equity interest (see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements).
our effective tax rates were (37.2)% and 60.3% in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 was primarily impacted by the effect of the 2017 tax act. our total income tax benefit in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 of $438.5 million reflects $612.6 million of tax benefits recognized and a reduction in the u.s. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, both resulting from the 2017 tax act. additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, a portion of a 2017 legal settlement charge was determined to be deductible, which favorably impacted our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018. we expect that the federal corporate tax rate reduction as a result of the 2017 tax act will continue to favorably impact our effective tax rate compared to prior periods through fiscal 2019. the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 was negatively impacted by non-deductible legal settlement charges. our effective tax rates for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018 and 2017 were favorably impacted by our international businesses in switzerland and ireland, which have lower income tax rates, and the benefit from stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting.
the pharmaceutical distribution services segment grew its revenue by 4.1% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to growth in some of its largest customers, overall market growth within the retail customer segment, and strong growth in sales of oncology products, offset in part by a decline in sales of products that treat hepatitis c.
revenue in other increased 10.4% from the prior fiscal year, primarily due to increased revenue from mwi due to strong growth in its companion animal business and abcs due to its growth in manufacturer service programs.

gross profit increased 6.4%, or $273.4 million, from the prior fiscal year. the increase in gross profit from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in lifo expense of $358.0 million and an increase in gross profit in other, offset in part by a decrease in gains from antitrust litigation settlements of $132.4 million and a decrease in gross profit in pharmaceutical distribution services. the lifo credit in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 was primarily driven by lower brand inflation and greater generic deflation in comparison to the prior fiscal year.
pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit decreased 1.5%, or $50.0 million, from the prior fiscal year. gross profit in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 was adversely impacted primarily by the kaiser permanente contract renewal effective july 1, 2016 at less favorable terms, a gpo customer contract renewal effective april 1, 2016 at less favorable terms, lower price appreciation, and a lower contribution from pharmedium as it shipped fewer units while we increased our investment in quality control and quality assurance systems to enhance product quality and patient safety and to meet all of pharmedium's commitments to the fda pursuant to the new federal requirements for outsourcing facilities, all of which were offset in part by an increase in revenue. as a percentage of revenue, pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit margin of 2.16% in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 decreased 12 basis points from the prior fiscal year. the decrease from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the above-mentioned contract renewals, lower price appreciation, and increased sales to some of our larger customers that typically have a lower gross profit margin.
gross profit in other increased 8.9%, or $98.2 million, from the prior fiscal year. the increase was primarily due to revenue growth of abcs and mwi. as a percentage of revenue, gross profit margin in other of 20.96% in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 decreased from 21.25% in the prior fiscal year.
we recognized gains from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers of $1.4 million and $133.8 million during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
employee severance, litigation, and other             959,327                   102,911
distribution, selling, and administrative expenses increased 1.8%, or $37.5 million, from the prior fiscal year and as a percentage of revenue was 1.39% in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017, a 3 basis point decline compared to the prior fiscal year. the decrease in expenses as a percentage of revenue in comparison to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to initiatives taken in the second half of fiscal 2016 to improve operating efficiency across many of our businesses and certain administrative functions.
depreciation expense increased 11.7% from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in the amount of property and equipment placed into service relating to our distribution infrastructure and various technology assets. amortization expense increased 5.3% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets originating from our november 6, 2015 acquisition of pharmedium.
employee severance, litigation, and other in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 included $7.8 million of employee severance costs primarily related to position eliminations as we began to reorganize to further align our organization to our customers' needs. litigation costs were $917.6 million in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 and primarily related to litigation settlements and accruals. other costs in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 included $17.0 million of acquisition-related deal and integration costs, $13.3 million of other restructuring initiatives, and $3.7 million related to our business transformation efforts.
employee severance, litigation, and other in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 included $38.8 million of employee severance costs primarily related to position eliminations as we reorganized certain of our business units and corporate functions to improve operating efficiency, a $17.1 million charge related to the transfer of surplus assets from our settled salaried defined benefit pension plan to its defined contribution 401(k) plan, $13.0 million of costs related to customer contract extensions (primarily related to the settlement of certain disputed items), $19.2 million of acquisition-related deal and integration costs, and $14.7 million of other restructuring initiatives.

pharmaceutical distribution services operating income decreased 3.5%, or $59.1 million, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the decrease in gross profit. as a percentage of revenue, pharmaceutical distribution services operating income margin of 1.11% decreased 9 basis points from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the prior year contract renewals at less favorable terms, lower price appreciation, and increased sales to some of our larger customers that typically have lower gross profit margin, offset in part by our initiatives to improve operating efficiency.
operating income in other increased 14.1%, or $46.1 million, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the gross profit increases of abcs and mwi, offset in part by an increase in operating expenses.
our effective tax rates were 60.3% and (2.7)% in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 was negatively impacted by legal settlements and accrual charges that we estimated to be non-deductible (see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements), offset in part by certain discrete items, the growth of our international businesses in switzerland and ireland that have significantly lower income tax rates, and the benefit from stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting. prior to the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017, tax benefits resulting from share-based compensation were recorded as adjustments to additional paid-in capital within stockholders' equity. our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 primarily benefited from the receipt of an internal revenue service private letter ruling that entitled us to an income tax deduction equal to the fair value of the warrants on the dates of exercise.
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those policies that involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management's judgment. actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates. below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent upon the application of estimates and assumptions. for a complete list of significant accounting policies, see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
allowances for returns and doubtful accounts trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for customer sales returns and an allowance for doubtful accounts. our customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit. we record an accrual for estimated customer sales returns at the time of sale to the customer based upon historical customer return trends. the allowance for returns as of september 30, 2018 and 2017 was $988.8 million and $1,001.7 million, respectively.
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider a combination of factors, such as the aging of trade receivables, industry trends, and our customers' financial strength, credit standing, and payment and default history. changes in the aforementioned factors, among others, may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts. the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables. each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based upon historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise. we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote. each business unit performs formal, documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly, and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly. there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods. the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts, net of write-offs, recoveries, and other adjustments.
business combinations the assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the acquisition or consolidation of a business are recorded at fair value, with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. we engage third-party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. such valuations require management to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. these estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include, but are not limited to: discount rates and expected future cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships, trade names, existing technology, and other intangible assets. unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or estimates.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as certain trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. for the purpose of these impairment tests, we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. we elected to bypass performing the qualitative assessment and, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, went directly to performing our annual quantitative assessments of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for the current year. we may elect to perform the qualitative annual assessment in future periods.
the goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required, and no impairment loss is recognized. if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the difference between the carrying value and the fair value is recorded as an impairment loss, the amount of which may not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
goodwill arises from acquisitions or consolidations of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. we identify our reporting units based upon our management reporting structure, beginning with our operating segments. we evaluate whether the components within our operating segments have similar economic characteristics, which include the nature of the components' products, services, and production processes, the types of customers and the methods by which products or services are delivered to customers, and the components' regulatory environment. our reporting units include pharmaceutical distribution services, profarma, abcs, world courier, and mwi.
we utilize an income-based approach to value our reporting units, with the exception of the profarma reporting unit, the fair value of which is based upon its publicly-traded stock price, plus an estimated control premium. the income-based approach relies on a discounted cash flow analysis, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate, to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. we generally believe that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of our reporting units in a sale transaction. the annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements, which are based upon our long-range plan. the discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both debt and equity, including a risk premium. while we use the best available information to prepare our cash flows and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows and/or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, our overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged.
the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (certain trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. we estimate the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method. we believe the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such indefinite-lived trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
we completed our required annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016. we recorded a goodwill impairment of $59.7 million in our profarma reporting unit in connection with our fiscal 2018 annual impairment test (see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial
statements). no goodwill impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017 and 2016. no indefinite-lived intangible impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016.
in connection with the goodwill impairment recorded in the profarma reporting unit, we first performed a recoverability assessment of profarma's long-lived assets by comparing its undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group, and it was determined to be recoverable; however, the forecasted undiscounted cash flows used to perform the recoverability assessment are inherently uncertain and include assumptions that could differ from actual results in future periods.
we perform a recoverability assessment of our long-lived assets when impairment indicators are present.
pharmedium healthcare holdings, inc.'s ("pharmedium") long-lived assets were also tested for recoverability in fiscal 2018 due to the existence of an impairment indicator. we voluntarily suspended production activities in december 2017 at its largest compounding facility located in memphis, tennessee after fda inspections of pharmedium's compounding facilities. we concluded that the suspension of production activity represented an impairment indicator of pharmedium's long-lived assets and, therefore, performed a recoverability assessment of pharmedium's long-lived assets. the recoverability assessment was based on the carrying value of the pharmedium asset group, excluding goodwill. the carrying value of the asset group was $903 million as of september 30, 2018. we concluded that pharmedium's long-lived assets are recoverable as of september 30, 2018; however, the forecasted undiscounted cash flows used to perform the recoverability assessment are inherently uncertain and include assumptions, such as the timing of resumed production activities and profitability, that could differ from actual results in future periods.
income taxes our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect management's assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements. deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes.
we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually. after application of the valuation allowances described above, we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above.
we prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based upon these judgments and interpretations. in the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation, and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions' tax court systems. significant judgment is exercised in applying complex tax laws and regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based upon the technical merits of the position.
we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances. however, others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued.
investments we first evaluate our investments in accordance with the variable interest model to determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an investment. this evaluation is made as of the date on which we make our initial investment, and subsequent evaluations are made if the structure of the investment changes. if it has been determined that an investment is a variable interest entity ("vie"), we evaluate whether the vie is required to be consolidated. when we hold rights that give us the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, combined with the obligation to absorb an entity's losses and the right to receive benefits, we consolidate a vie. if it is determined that an investment is not a vie, we then evaluate our investments under the voting interest model and generally consolidate investments in which we hold an ownership interest of greater than 50%. when we consolidate less than wholly-owned subsidiaries, we recognize our noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements.
we generally account for ownership interests of between 20% and 50% under the equity method of accounting. unrealized losses that are determined to be other-than-temporary impairment losses are recorded as a component of earnings in the period in which that determination is made. there were no impairment charges on equity investments in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018, 2017, or 2016.
loss contingencies in the ordinary course of business, we become involved in lawsuits, administrative proceedings, government subpoenas, government investigations, and other disputes, including antitrust, commercial, environmental, product liability, intellectual property, regulatory, employment discrimination, and other matters. significant damages or penalties may be sought in some matters, and some matters may require years to resolve. we record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. we also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued. if a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements. we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made.
merchandise inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. cost for approximately 75% and 80% of our inventories as of september 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, has been determined using the lifo method. if we had used the first-in, first-out method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have been approximately $1,534.4 million and $1,467.0 million higher than the amounts reported as of september 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. we recorded lifo expense of $67.3 million and $200.2 million in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018 and 2016, respectively. we recorded a lifo credit of $157.8 million in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017. the annual lifo provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences, many of which are difficult to predict. changes to any of the above factors can have a material impact to our annual lifo provision.
liquidity and capital resources the following illustrates our debt structure as of september 30, 2018, including availability under the multi-currency revolving credit facility, the receivables securitization facility, the revolving credit note, and the overdraft facility:
(in thousands)                                                outstandingbalance   additionalavailability fixed-rate debt:

overdraft facility due 2021 (£30,000)                            13,269            25,818
our operating results have generated cash flows, which, together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, have provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of debt, the payment of interest on outstanding debt, dividends, and repurchases of shares of our common stock.
our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the repayment of debt, fund the payment of interest on debt, fund repurchases of our common stock, fund the payment of dividends, finance acquisitions, and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements.
as of september 30, 2018 and 2017, our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were $842.5 million and $995.7 million, respectively, and are generally based in u.s. dollar denominated holdings. prior to the 2017 tax act, we intended to indefinitely reinvest this cash in foreign investments or foreign operations. after further assessment of the impact of the 2017 tax act, we reevaluated our position and determined that we are no longer permanently reinvested with respect to foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are able to be repatriated with minimal to no additional tax impact. in accordance with the 2017 tax act (see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements), historical foreign earnings and profits are now subject to a one-time transition tax, which we currently estimate to be $219.6 million, net of overpayments and tax credits. in september 2018, we repatriated $638.0 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries to use for general corporate purposes.
we have increased seasonal needs related to our inventory build during the december and march quarters that, depending on our cash balance, may require the use of our credit facilities to fund short-term capital needs. our cash balance in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018 and 2017 needed to be supplemented by intra-period credit facility borrowings to cover short-term working capital needs. the largest amount of intra-period borrowings under our revolving and securitization credit facilities that was outstanding at any one time during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018 and 2017 was $1,508.2 million and $626.1 million, respectively. we had $25,115.3 million, $9,324.7 million, and $8,333.7 million of cumulative intra-period borrowings that were repaid under our credit facilities during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. additionally, in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016, we borrowed $500.0 million under our receivables securitization facility that we used to finance principal payments that we elected to make on the november 2015 term loan (see below).
we used the proceeds from the 2027 notes and the 2047 notes to finance the early retirement of our $400 million of 4.875% senior notes that were due in 2019, including the payment of a $22.3 million prepayment premium, and to finance the acquisition of h.d. smith, which was completed in january 2018.
we have a $1.4 billion multi-currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility ("multi-currency revolving credit facility") with a syndicate of lenders, which was scheduled to expire in november 2021. in october 2018, we entered into an amendment to, among other things, extend the maturity to october 2023 and modify certain restrictive covenants, including modifications to allow for indebtedness of foreign subsidiaries. interest on borrowings under the multi-currency revolving credit facility accrues at specified rates based upon our debt rating and ranges from 70 basis points to 110 basis points over cdor/libor/euribor/bankers acceptance stamping fee, as applicable (91 basis points over cdor/libor/euribor/bankers acceptance stamping fee as of september 30, 2018) and from 0 basis points to 10 basis points over the alternate base rate and canadian prime rate, as applicable. we pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the multi-currency revolving credit facility at specified rates based upon our debt rating, ranging from 5 basis points to 15 basis points, annually, of the total commitment (9 basis points as of september 30, 2018). we may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the multi-currency revolving credit facility at any time. the multi-currency revolving credit facility contains covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of subsidiaries and asset sales, with which we were compliant as of september 30, 2018.
we have a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue short-term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to $1.4 billion at any one time. amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time. the maturities on the notes will vary, but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance. the notes will bear interest, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts. the commercial paper program does not increase our borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by our multi-currency revolving credit facility. there were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program as of september 30, 2018 and 2017.
we have a $1,450 million receivables securitization facility ("receivables securitization facility"), which was scheduled to expire in november 2019. in october 2018, we entered into an amendment to extend the maturity to october 2021. we have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the receivables securitization facility may be increased by up to $250 million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs during the december and march quarters. interest rates are based upon prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper or libor plus a program fee. we pay a customary unused fee at prevailing market rates, annually, to maintain the availability under the receivables securitization facility. in fiscal 2016, we utilized the capacity to borrow $500 million on the receivables securitization facility to finance $500 million of principal payments that we elected to make on the november 2015 term loan (defined below), as the receivables securitization facility bears interest at a lower rate. the receivables securitization facility contains similar covenants to the multi-currency revolving credit facility, with which we were compliant as of september 30, 2018.
in connection with the receivables securitization facility, amerisourcebergen drug corporation sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to amerisource receivables financial corporation, a wholly-owned special purpose entity, which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to financial institutions and commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions. amerisourcebergen drug corporation is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the receivables securitization facility. as sold receivables are collected, additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility. we use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources.
we have an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a revolving credit note ("revolving credit note"). the revolving credit note provides us with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $75 million. the revolving credit note may be decreased or terminated by the bank or us at any time without prior notice. we also have a £30 million uncommitted u.k. overdraft facility ("overdraft facility"), which expires in february 2021, to fund short-term, normal trading cycle fluctuations related to our mwi business.
in february 2015, we entered into a $1.0 billion variable-rate term loan (the "february 2015 term loan"), which matures in 2020. through september 30, 2018, we elected to make principal payments, prior to the scheduled repayment dates, of $925.0 million on the february 2015 term loan, and as a result, our next required principal payment is due upon maturity. the february 2015 term loan bears interest at a rate equal either to a base rate plus a margin, or libor, plus a margin. the margin is based
upon our public debt ratings and ranges from 75 basis points to 125 basis points over libor (100 basis points as of september 30, 2018) and 0 basis points to 25 basis points over a base rate. the february 2015 term loan contains similar covenants to the multi-currency revolving credit facility, with which we were compliant as of september 30, 2018.
in november 2015, we entered into a $1.0 billion variable-rate term loan (the "november 2015 term loan"), which matures in 2020. through september 30, 2018, we made a scheduled principal payment, as well as other principal payments prior to the scheduled repayment dates totaling $675.0 million on the november 2015 term loan, and as a result, our next scheduled principal payment is due upon maturity. the november 2015 term loan bears interest at a rate equal either to a base rate, plus a margin, or libor, plus a margin. the margin is based upon our public debt ratings and ranges from 75 basis points to 125 basis points over libor (100 basis points as of september 30, 2018) and 0 basis points to 25 basis points over a base rate. the november 2015 term loan contains similar covenants to the multi-currency revolving credit facility, with which we are compliant as of september 30, 2018. we used the proceeds from the november 2015 term loan to finance a portion of the cash consideration paid in connection with the acquisition of pharmedium.
the february 2015 and november 2015 term loans (collectively, the "term loans") were scheduled to mature in november 2020 and february 2020, respectively. in october 2018, we refinanced the term loans by issuing a new variable-rate term loan ("october 2018 term loan"), which matures in october 2020. the october 2018 term loan bears interest at a rate equal to a base rate or libor, plus a margin of 65 basis points.the october 2018 term loan contains similar covenants to the multi-currency revolving credit facility.
in addition to the 2027 notes and the 2047 notes, both of which were issued in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018, we have $500 million of 3.50% senior notes due november 15, 2021, $500 million of 3.40% senior notes due may 15, 2024, $500 million of 3.25% senior notes due march 1, 2025, and $500 million of 4.25% senior notes due march 1, 2045 (collectively, the "notes"). interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears.
we consolidated the nonrecourse short-term and long-term debt of profarma and the specialty joint venture in brazil in connection with the incremental investments made in january 2018 (see note 2 and note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements). nonrecourse debt is repaid solely from the brazil subsidiaries' cash flows and such debt agreements provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts, and cash flows of the brazil subsidiaries.
in august 2013, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to $750 million of our shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. during the six months ended march 31, 2016, we purchased $100.0 million of our common stock under this program. in may 2016, our board of directors authorized a new share purchase program that, together with availability remaining under the existing august 2013 share repurchase program, permitted us to purchase up to $750 million in shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. in september 2016, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase ("asr") transaction with a financial institution and paid $400.0 million for shares of our common stock. the initial payment of $400.0 million funded stock purchases of $380.0 million and a share holdback of $20.0 million. the asr transaction was settled in november 2016, at which time the financial institution delivered additional shares to us. the number of shares ultimately received was based upon the volume-weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the asr. we applied the $400.0 million asr to this program. in addition to the asr, during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016, we purchased $231.2 million of our common stock under this program. during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017, we purchased $118.8 million of our common stock to complete our authorization under this program.
in november 2016, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to $1.0 billion in shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017, we purchased $211.1 million of our common stock under this program. during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018, we purchased $663.1 million of our common stock under this program, which included $24.0 million of september 2018 purchases that cash settled in october 2018. as of september 30, 2018, we had $125.8 million of availability remaining under this program.
in october 2018, our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to $1.0 billion of our shares of common stock, subject to market conditions.
in march 2013, we and wba entered into various agreements and arrangements pursuant to which subsidiaries of wba were granted the right to purchase a minority equity position in us, beginning with the right, but not the obligation, to purchase up to 19,859,795 shares of our common stock in open market transactions (approximately 7% of our common stock on a fully diluted basis as of the date of issuance of the warrants described below, assuming their exercise in full). in connection with these arrangements, wholly-owned subsidiaries of wba were issued (a) warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 22,696,912 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share, exercisable during a six-month period beginning in march 2016 (the "2016 warrants"), and (b) warrants to purchase up to 22,696,912 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $52.50
per share, exercisable during a six-month period beginning in march 2017 (the "2017 warrants" and together with the 2016 warrants, the "warrants").
in june 2013, we commenced a strategy to mitigate the dilutive effect of the warrants upon exercise. prior to fiscal 2016, we purchased 18.8 million shares of our common stock for $1,774.1 million under special share repurchase programs. during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016, we purchased 26.3 million shares of our common stock for $1,535.1 million under a special share repurchase program.
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt, minimum rental payments on our noncancelable operating leases and financing obligations, and minimum payments on our other commitments as of september 30, 2018:
payments due by period (in thousands)                                               debt, including interest payments                                                                operating leases                                                         financing obligations 1                                                               other commitments                                                                           total within 1 year                                                                            $309,125                                                                         $89,589                                                                         $26,561                                                                         $84,198                                                                        $509,473
1 represents the portion of future minimum lease payments relating to facility leases where we were determined to be the accounting owner (see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements). these payments are recognized as reductions to the financing obligation and as interest expense and exclude the future non-cash termination of the financing obligation.
the 2017 tax act requires a one-time transition tax to be recognized on historical foreign earnings and profits. we currently estimate that our liability related to the transition tax is $219.6 million, net of overpayments and tax credits, as of september 30, 2018, which is payable in installments over a six-year period commencing in january 2021. the transition tax commitment is included in "other commitments" in the above table.
we outsource to ibm global services a significant portion of our data center operations. the remaining commitment under our arrangement, which expires in january 2021, is approximately $33.7 million as of september 30, 2018, $15.0 million of which represents our commitment in fiscal 2019, and is included in "other commitments" in the above table.
our liability for uncertain tax positions was $112.9 million (including interest and penalties) as of september 30, 2018. this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table.
during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018 and 2017, our operating activities provided cash of $1,411.4 million and $1,504.1 million, respectively. cash provided by operations in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 was principally the result of net income of $1,615.9 million, an increase in accounts payable of $859.0 million, and an increase in income taxes payable of $209.9 million, offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable of $657.8 million and a decrease in accrued expenses of $537.9 million. the increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by the timing of scheduled payments to suppliers. the increase in income taxes payable was primarily driven by a one-time transition tax on historical foreign earnings and profits through december 31, 2017 in connection with tax reform. the decrease in accrued expenses was primarily driven by the payment of a legal settlement of $625.0 million, plus interest (see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements). the increase in accounts receivable was the result of our revenue growth and the timing of payments from our customers. non-cash items were comprised primarily of a $795.5 million deferred income tax benefit, $318.5 million of depreciation expense, and $191.6 million of amortization expense. the deferred income tax benefit was primarily the result of applying a lower u.s. federal income tax rate to our net deferred tax liabilities as of december 31, 2017 in connection with tax reform.
deterioration of general economic conditions, among other factors, could adversely affect the number of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and, therefore, could reduce purchases by our customers. in addition, volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms. reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth, our profitability, and our cash flow from operations.
we use days sales outstanding, days inventory on hand, and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance. the below financial metrics are calculated based upon an annual average and can be impacted by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements, which can vary significantly depending upon the day of the week in which the month ends.
the increase in days sales outstanding from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 was the result of a gradual change in payment terms with our largest customer.
our cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based upon fluctuations in our period end working capital. additionally, any changes to payment terms with a significant customer or manufacturer supplier could have a material impact to our cash flows from operations. operating cash flows during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2018 included $162.1 million of interest payments and $104.0 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. operating cash flows during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 included $125.3 million of interest payments and $105.0 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. operating cash flows during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 included $123.5 million of interest payments and $17.5 million of income tax payments, net of refunds.
during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017 and 2016, our operating activities provided cash of $1,504.1 million and $3,178.5 million, respectively. cash provided by operations in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 was principally the result of an increase in accounts payable of $1,473.4 million, non-cash items of $672.5 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $661.2 million, and net income of $364.5 million, offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable of $1,277.9 million and an increase in merchandise inventories of $431.5 million. the increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by the increase in merchandise inventories and the timing of scheduled payments to our suppliers. the non-cash items were comprised primarily of $319.1 million of deferred income tax expense, $262.4 million of depreciation expense, $169.9 million of amortization expense, and a lifo credit of $157.8 million. the increase in accrued expenses was primarily driven by a litigation accrual of $625.0 million (see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements). the increase in accounts receivable was the result of our revenue growth and a gradual change in payment terms with our largest customer that occurred between may 2016 and february 2017 as part of a contract amendment that, among other things, extended the term of our relationship with the customer. we increased our merchandise inventories as of september 30, 2017 to support the increase in business volume.
capital expenditures in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $336.4 million, $466.4 million, and $464.6 million, respectively. significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 and 2017 included technology initiatives, including costs related to enhancing and upgrading our information technology systems and costs associated with expanding distribution capacity. significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 included costs associated with expanding distribution capacity, technology initiatives, including costs related to the development of track-and-trace technology, and the expansion of support facilities.

we anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. however, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors.
market risk we have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt. we manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. the amount of variable-rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements. we had $1.0 billion of variable-rate debt outstanding as of september 30, 2018. we periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates. however, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and/or on terms acceptable to us. there were no such financial instruments in effect as of september 30, 2018.
we have minimal exposure to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non-u.s. operations. our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the euro, the u.k. pound sterling, the canadian dollar, and the brazilian real. revenue from our foreign operations is less than two percent of our consolidated revenue. we may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates. we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure, but not for speculative or trading purposes. as of september 30, 2018, we had one foreign currency denominated contract outstanding that hedges the foreign currency exchange risk of a c$17.5 million outstanding note.

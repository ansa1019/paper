item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the following discussion contains "forward-looking statements" that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs, and expected performance. actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. see item 1a. "risk factors" and "cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements."
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the permian basin in west texas. our activities are primarily directed at the horizontal development of the wolfcamp and spraberry formations in the midland basin and the wolfcamp and bone spring formations in the delaware basin. we intend to continue to develop our reserves and increase production through development drilling and exploitation and exploration activities on our multi-year inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives, targeting oil-weighted reserves. substantially all of our revenues are generated through the sale of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production.
on december 31, 2018, our acreage position in the permian basin was approximately 604,367 gross (461,218 net) acres, which consisted primarily of approximately 231,100 gross (194,661 net) acres in the midland basin and approximately 232,143 gross (170,205 net) acres in the delaware basin.
2018 was another transformational year for us. we successfully closed three acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2018, including our acquisition of energen corporation, or energen, which acquisitions, on a combined basis, almost doubled our core acreage position. during the same period, oil prices declined dramatically, and we quickly addressed the issue by announcing a reduction in activity levels in late 2018 and acting on that plan immediately in 2019. at current commodity prices, we expect to grow production by over 27% year over year within cash flow in 2019, while increasing our dividend by 50% beginning with the first quarter of 2019. by remaining focused on corporate returns and prudent capital allocation, we believe that in the current commodity price environment we are positioned to generate significant free cash flow while continuing to grow production at industry leading rates in 2020 and beyond. we are operating 21 rigs now and currently intend to operate between 18 and 22 rigs in 2019. we will continue monitoring the ongoing commodity price environment and expect to retain the financial flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion plans in response to market conditions.
2018 transactions and recent developments merger with energen corporation on november 29, 2018, we completed our acquisition of energen in an all-stock transaction, which we refer to as the merger. we consolidate our results of operations with those of energen and its subsidiaries acquired by us in the merger beginning with november 29, 2019, the closing date of the merger. we accounted for the merger as a business combination.
the addition of energen's assets increased our assets to: (i) over 273,000 net tier one acres in the permian basin, an increase of 57% from third quarter 2018 tier one acreage of approximately 174,000 net acres, (ii) over 7,200 estimated total net horizontal permian locations, an increase of over 120% from third quarter 2018 estimated net locations, and (iii) approximately 394,000 net acres across the midland and delaware basins, an increase of 82% from our approximately 216,000 net acres as september 30, 2018, in each after giving effect to our recently completed ajax acquisition and exl acquisition discussed below.
under the terms of the merger agreement, we assumed energen's outstanding debt, which at the effective time of the merger was approximately $1.1 billion. this amount consisted of $559.0 million of borrowings under energen's existing credit facility, $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% notes, due september 1, 2021, $20.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.32% medium-term notes, series a, due july 28, 2022, $10.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.35% medium-term notes, series a, due july 28, 2027, and $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.125% medium-term notes, series b, due february 15, 2028, which we collectively refer to as the energen notes. in connection with the closing of the merger, we repaid the outstanding borrowings of $559.0 million under the energen credit facility using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
ajax resources, llc on october 31, 2018, we acquired certain leasehold interests and related assets of ajax resources, llc, which we refer to as ajax, which included approximately 25,493 net leasehold acres in the northern midland basin, for $900.0 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments, and approximately 2.6 million shares of our common stock, which we refer to as the ajax acquisition. the ajax acquisition was effective as of july 1, 2018. the cash portion of this transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand, proceeds from the sale of mineral interests to viper energy partners lp, which we refer to as viper or the partnership, described below, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from our september 2018 senior note offering. see "-new senior notes" below.
in connection with the closing of the ajax acquisition on october 31, 2018, we entered into a registration rights agreement with ajax and certain other holders of our common stock pursuant to which we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to facilitate the resale of common stock issued in the ajax acquisition. the shelf registration statement became automatically effective on november 30, 2018. pursuant to this registration rights agreement, we also agreed to provide certain demand and piggyback registration rights to such holders.
on december 11, 2018, we entered into an atm equity offering sm sales agreement with ajax, certain other holders of our common stock and merrill lynch, pierce, fenner & smith incorporated, as sales agent, in connection with potential sales from time to time during the term of the sales agreement by ajax of up to approximately 2.0 million shares of our common stock under the above-referenced shelf registration statement.
exl petroleum management, llc and energyquest ii llc acquisition on october 31, 2018, we acquired certain leasehold interests and related assets of exl petroleum management, llc, exl petroleum operating, inc. and energyquest ii llc, which included an aggregate of approximately 3,646 net leasehold acres in the northern midland basin for a total of $312.5 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments. these acquisitions which we collectively refer to as the exl acquisition, were effective as of august 1, 2018, and were funded through a combination of cash on hand, proceeds from the sale of assets to the partnership (described below) and borrowing under our revolving credit facility.
alliance with obsidian resources, l.l.c.
we entered into a participation and development agreement, which we refer to as the drillco agreement, dated september 10, 2018, with obsidian resources, l.l.c., which we refer to as cemof, to fund oil and natural gas development. funds managed by cemof and its affiliates have agreed to commit to funding certain costs out of cemof's net production revenue and, for a period of time, to the extent not funded by such revenue, up to an additional $300.0 million, to fund drilling programs on locations provided by us. subject to adjustments depending on asset characteristics and return expectations of the selected drilling plan, cemof will fund up to 85% of the costs associated with new wells drilled under the drillco agreement and is expected to receive an 80% working interest in these wells until it reaches certain payout thresholds equal to a cumulative 9% and then 13% internal rate of return. upon reaching the final internal rate of return target, cemof's interest will be reduced to 15%, while our interest will increase to 85%.
transportation contracts in 2018, we entered into 100,000 bod/d volume commitments with each of the epic pipeline project and the gray oak pipeline project, with 50% of the volumes covered via take or pay contracts and 50% covered via acreage dedications.  in connection with such commitments, in february 2019 we closed on our acquisition of 10% equity interests in each of the epic and the gray oak pipeline projects.  the epic and gray oak pipeline projects are each anticipated to be operational in the second half of 2019. these long-haul crude oil pipelines, which will terminate in the refinery-dense, export-focused texas gulf coast market, will allow us to access premium texas gulf coast pricing as opposed to discounted local pricing at midland, texas.
new senior notes on january 29, 2018, we issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of new 2025 notes as additional notes under our existing indenture, dated as of december 20, 2016, as supplemented, among us, subsidiary guarantors party thereto and wells fargo, as trustee, under which we previously issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our existing 5.375% senior notes due 2025. we received approximately $308.4 million in net proceeds, after deducting the initial purchaser's discount and our estimated offering expenses, but disregarding accrued interest, from the issuance of the new 2025 notes. we used the net proceeds from the issuance of the new 2025 notes to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
on september 25, 2018, we issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of new 4.750% senior notes due 2024, or the new 2024 notes. the new 2024 notes were issued in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements under the securities act. we received approximately $740.7 million in net proceeds, after deducting the initial purchasers' discount and our estimated offering expenses, but disregarding accrued interest, from the issuance of the new 2024 notes. we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the new 2024 notes to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings our revolving credit facility and we used the balance for general corporate purposes, including the funding of a portion of the cash consideration for the ajax acquisition.
recapitalization, tax status election and related transactions by viper in march 2018, viper announced that the board of directors of its general partner had unanimously approved a change of viper's federal income tax status from that of a pass-through partnership to that of a taxable entity via a "check the box" election. in connection with making this election, on may 9, 2018 viper (i) amended and restated its first amended and restated partnership agreement, (ii) amended and restated the first amended and restated limited liability company agreement of viper energy partners llc, or the operating company, (iii) amended and restated its existing registration rights agreement with us and (iv) entered into an exchange agreement with us, viper's general partner, or the general partner, and the operating company. simultaneously with the effectiveness of these agreements, we delivered and assigned to viper the 73,150,000 common units we owned in exchange for (i) 73,150,000 of viper's newly-issued class b units and (ii) 73,150,000 newly-issued units of the operating company pursuant to the terms of a recapitalization agreement dated march 28, 2018, as amended as of may 9, 2018, or the recapitalization agreement. immediately following that exchange, viper continued to be the managing member of the operating company, with sole control of its operations, and owned approximately 36% of the outstanding units issued by the operating company, and we owned the remaining approximately 64% of the outstanding units issued by the operating company. upon completion of viper's july 2018 offering of units, viper owned approximately 41% of the outstanding units issued by the operating company and we owned the remaining approximately 59%. the operating company units and viper's class b units owned by us are exchangeable from time to time for viper's common units (that is, one operating company unit and one viper class b unit, together, will be exchangeable for one viper common unit).
on may 10, 2018, the change in viper's income tax status became effective. on that date, pursuant to the terms of the recapitalization agreement, (i) the general partner made a cash capital contribution of $1.0 million to viper in respect of its general partner interest and (ii) we made a cash capital contribution of $1.0 million to viper in respect of the class b units. we, as the holder of the class b units, and the general partner, as the holder of the general partner interest, are entitled to receive an 8% annual distribution on the outstanding amount of these capital contributions, payable quarterly, as a return on this invested capital. on may 10, 2018, we also exchanged 731,500 class b units and 731,500 units in the operating company for 731,500 common units of viper and a cash amount of $10,000 representing a proportionate return of the $1.0 million invested capital in respect of the class b units. the general partner continues to serve as viper's general partner and we continue to control viper. after the effectiveness of the tax status election and the completion of related transactions, viper's minerals business continues to be conducted through the operating company, which continues to be taxed as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes. this structure is anticipated to provide significant benefits to viper's business, including operational effectiveness, acquisition and disposition transactional planning flexibility and income tax efficiency. for additional information regarding
the tax status election and related transactions, please refer to viper's definitive information statement on schedule 14c filed with the sec on april 17, 2018 and viper's current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on may 15, 2018.
viper's july 2018 equity offering in july 2018, viper completed an underwritten public offering of 10,080,000 common units, which included 1,080,000 common units issued pursuant to an option to purchase additional common units granted to the underwriters. following this offering, we owned approximately 59% of viper's total units then outstanding. viper received net proceeds from this offering of approximately $303.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. viper used the net proceeds to purchase units of the operating company. the operating company in turn used the net proceeds to repay a portion of the $361.5 million then outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility.
in the midland basin, we continue have positive results across our core development areas located within midland, martin, howard, glasscock and andrews counties, where development has primarily focused on drilling long-lateral, multi-well pads targeting the spraberry and wolfcamp formations.
in the delaware basin, we have now drilled and completed multiple wells in pecos, reeves and ward counties targeting the wolfcamp a, which we believe has been de-risked across a significant portion of our total acreage position and remains our primary development target. in 2019, we expect to focus development on these areas as well as our northern delaware basin acreage acquired in the energen transaction.
we continue to focus on low cost operations and best in class execution. to combat rising service costs, we have looked to lock in pricing for dedicated activity levels and will continue to seek opportunities to control additional well cost where possible. our 2019 drilling and completion budget accounts for capital costs that we believe will cover potential increases in our service costs during the year.
2019 capital budget we have currently budgeted a 2019 total capital spend of $2.7 billion to $3.0 billion, consisting of $2.3 billion to $2.55 billion for horizontal drilling and completions including non-operated activity, $400.0 million to $450.0 million for midstream and infrastructure investments, excluding equity investments in long-haul pipelines or the cost of any leasehold and mineral rights acquisitions. we expect to drill and complete 290 to 320 gross horizontal wells in 2019.
transactions, were held constant throughout the life of the properties and have been adjusted for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead.
unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month prices
sources of our revenue our revenues are derived from the sale of oil and natural gas production, as well as the sale of natural gas liquids that are extracted from our natural gas during processing. our oil and natural gas revenues do not include the effects of derivatives. our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold, production mix or commodity prices.
since our production consists primarily of oil, our revenues are more sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices than they are to fluctuations in natural gas liquids or natural gas prices. oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas prices have historically been volatile. during 2018, wti posted prices ranged from $44.48 to $77.41 per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from $2.49 to $6.24 per mmbtu. on december 28, 2018, the wti posted price for crude oil was $45.15 per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was $3.25 per mmbtu. lower prices may not only decrease our revenues, but also potentially the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. lower oil and natural gas prices may also result in a reduction in the borrowing base under our credit agreement, which may be determined at the discretion of our lenders.
principal components of our cost structure lease operating expenses. these are daily costs incurred to bring oil and natural gas out of the ground and to the market, together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties. such costs also include maintenance, repairs and workover expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties.
production and ad valorem taxes. production taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at fixed rates established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. where available, we benefit from tax credits and exemptions in our various taxing jurisdictions. we are also subject to ad valorem taxes in the counties where our production is located. ad valorem taxes are generally based on the valuation of our oil and gas properties.
general and administrative expenses. these are costs incurred for overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, costs of maintaining our headquarters, costs of managing our production and development operations, franchise taxes, audit and other fees for professional services and legal compliance.
midstream services expense. these are costs incurred to operate and maintain our oil and natural gas gathering and transportation systems, natural gas lift, compression infrastructure and water transportation facilities.
depreciation, depletion and amortization. under the full cost accounting method, we capitalize costs within a cost center and then systematically expense those costs on a units of production basis based on proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities. we calculate depletion on the following types of costs: (i) all capitalized costs, other than the cost of investments in unproved properties and major development projects for which proved reserves cannot yet be assigned, less accumulated amortization; (ii) the estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing proved reserves; and (iii) the estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs, net of estimated salvage values. depreciation of other property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to fifteen years.
interest income (expense). we have financed a portion of our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes. we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. this amount reflects interest paid to our lender plus the amortization of deferred financing costs (including origination and amendment fees), commitment fees and annual agency fees net of interest received on our cash and cash equivalents.
gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net. we utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil. this amount represents (i) the recognition of the change in the fair value of open non-hedge derivative contracts as commodity prices change and commodity derivative contracts expire or new ones are entered into, and (ii) our gains and losses on the settlement of these commodity derivative instruments.
deferred tax assets (liabilities). we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of (1) temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and (2) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted. a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
results of operations the following table sets forth selected historical operating data for the periods indicated. our results of operations for 2018 include those of energen and its subsidiaries acquired by us in the merger for the period november 29, 2018, the closing date of the merger, through december 31, 2018.
provision for (benefit from) income taxes                          168,362                   (19,568    )                192
(1)   hedged prices reflect the effect of our commodity derivative transactions on our average sales prices. our calculation of such effects include realized gains and losses on cash settlements for commodity derivatives, which we do not designate for hedge accounting.
oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues. our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues increased by approximately $943.5 million, or 80%, to $2.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 from $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017. our revenues are a function of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes. average daily production sold increased by 51,215 boe/d to 130,439 boe/d during the year ended december 31, 2018 from 79,224 boe/d during the year ended december 31, 2017. the total increase in revenue of approximately $943.5 million is attributable to higher oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes and higher average sales prices for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. the increases in production volumes were due to a combination of increased drilling activity and growth through acquisitions. our production increased by 12,949 mbbls of oil, 14,009 mmcf of natural gas and 3,409 mbbls of natural gas liquids for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2017.
midstream services revenue. midstream services revenue was $34.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, an increase of $27.2 million as compared to $7.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. our midstream services revenue represents fees charged to our joint interest owners and third parties for the transportation of oil and natural gas along with water gathering and related disposal facilities. these assets complement our operations in areas where we have significant production.
production and ad valorem taxes. production and ad valorem taxes were $132.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, an increase of $59.2 million, or 80%, from $73.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. in general, production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes; however, texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices, among other factors, whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices. during the year ended december 31, 2018, production and ad valorem taxes per boe increased by $0.25 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2017, primarily due to increased commodity prices and production volumes.
midstream services expense. midstream services expense was $71.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, an increase of $61.5 million as compared to $10.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase was primarily due to additional build out of systems and increased throughput related to increased production. midstream services expense represents costs incurred to operate and maintain our oil and natural gas gathering and transportation systems, natural gas lift, compression infrastructure and water transportation facilities.
general and administrative expenses. general and administrative expenses increased $15.9 million from $48.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 to $64.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase was primarily due to an increase in employee count, including as a result of our recent merger with energen.
derivatives. we are required to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. we have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes. as a result, we mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and non-cash changes in fair value on derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of operations under the line item captioned "gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net." for the year ended december 31, 2018, we had a cash loss on settlement of derivative instruments of $120.4 million as compared to a cash gain on settlement of derivative instruments of $6.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. for the year ended december 31, 2018, we had a positive change in the fair value of open derivative instruments of $221.7 million as compared to a negative change of $84.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. our net gain on derivative instruments for the year ended december 31, 2018 was due to the assumption of energen's hedges and lower commodity prices.
provision for (benefit from) income taxes. we recorded an income tax provision of $168.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to an income tax benefit of $19.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. our effective tax rate was 15.1% for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to (3.9)% for the year ended december 31, 2017. the change in our income tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 is primarily due to the to the increase in pre-tax book income for the year ended december 31, 2018, partially offset by the tax effect reflected in the consolidated tax provision of the tax status change for viper in the year ended december 31, 2018, the deferred tax benefits resulting from the change in the valuation allowance for the year ended december 31, 2017, and the reduction of the federal statutory tax rate enacted during the year ended december 31, 2017.
oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues. our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues increased by approximately $659.2 million, or 125%, to $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017 from $527.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. our revenues are a function of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes. average daily production sold increased by 36,193 boe/d to 79,224 boe/d during the year ended december 31, 2017 from 43,031 boe/d during the year ended december 31, 2016. the total increase in revenue of approximately $659.2 million is attributable to higher oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production volumes and higher average sales prices for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the increases in production volumes were due to a combination of increased drilling activity and growth through acquisitions. our production increased by 9,856 mbbls of oil, 1,656 mbbls of natural gas liquids and 9,931 mmcf of natural gas for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016.
midstream services revenue. midstream services revenue was $7.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. we began generating midstream services revenue during the first quarter of 2017 and, prior to that period, had no midstream services revenue. our midstream services revenue represents fees charged to our joint interest owners and third parties for the transportation of oil and natural gas along with water gathering and related disposal facilities. these assets complement our operations in areas where we have significant production.
production and ad valorem taxes. production and ad valorem taxes increased to $73.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 from $34.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. in general, production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes; however, texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices, whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices. the increase in production and ad valorem taxes during the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in our production taxes as a result of increased commodity prices and volumes.
midstream services expense. midstream services expense was $10.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. prior to the first quarter of 2017, we had no midstream services expense. midstream services expense represents costs incurred to operate and maintain our oil and natural gas gathering and transportation systems, natural gas lift, compression infrastructure and water transportation facilities.
impairment of oil and natural gas properties. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment of oil and gas properties of $245.5 million as a result of the significant decline in commodity prices, which resulted in a reduction of the discounted present value of our proved oil and natural gas reserves. we did not record an impairment of oil and natural gas properties during the year ended december 31, 2017.
general and administrative expenses. general and administrative expenses increased $6.1 million from $42.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 to $48.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase was due to an increase in salaries and benefits expense as a result of an increase in workforce.
net interest expense. net interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $40.6 million as compared to $40.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.1 million. this decrease was due primarily to the issuance in october 2016 of new senior notes due 2024 with a lower interest rate than the senior notes which we redeemed in the fourth quarter of 2016 partially offset by the interest on the additional senior notes due in 2025 that we issued in december 2016.
gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net. we are required to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. we have not designated our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes. as a result, we mark our derivative instruments to fair value and recognize the cash and non-cash changes in fair value on derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of operations under the line item captioned "gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net." for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a cash gain on settlement of derivative instruments of $6.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a negative change in the fair value of open derivative instruments of $84.2 million and $26.5 million, respectively.
provision for (benefit from) income taxes. we recorded an income tax benefit of $19.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to an income tax provision of $0.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. our effective tax rate was (3.9)% for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to (0.1)% for the year ended december 31, 2016. the change in our income tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016 is primarily due to the reduction in our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, as well as the favorable impact of the reduction in the federal statutory tax rate enacted in december 2017. while we generated positive pre-tax income from continuing operations in 2017, our 2017 effective tax rate was negative due to the income tax benefit generated by these items.
liquidity and capital resources historically, our primary sources of liquidity have been proceeds from our public equity offerings, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes and cash flows from operations. our primary use of capital has been for the acquisition, development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties. as we pursue reserves and production growth, we regularly consider which capital resources, including equity and debt financings, are available to meet our future financial obligations, planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements. our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us.
liquidity and cash flow our cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are presented below:
net cash provided by operating activities      $1,564,505                  $888,625                  $332,080
net cash used in investing activities          (3,503,043    )           (3,132,282    )           (1,310,242    )
net cash provided by financing activities       2,040,608                   689,529                 2,624,621
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $1.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to $888.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in operating cash flows is primarily the result of an increase in our oil and natural gas revenues due to an increase in average prices and production growth during the year ended december 31, 2018.
net cash provided by operating activities was $888.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to $332.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase in operating cash flows is primarily the result of an increase in our oil and natural gas revenues due to an increase in average prices and production growth during the year ended december 31, 2017.
our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for the oil and natural gas we produce. prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. regional and worldwide economic activity, weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products. these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. see "-sources of our revenue" and item 1a. "risk factors" above.
investing activities the purchase and development of oil and natural gas properties accounted for the majority of our cash outlays for investing activities. we used cash for investing activities of $3.5 billion, $3.1 billion and $1.3 billion during the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
during the year ended december 31, 2018, we spent (a) $1.5 billion on capital expenditures in conjunction with our drilling program, in which we drilled 189 gross (168 net) horizontal wells and completed 176 gross (155 net) operated horizontal wells, (b) $204.2 million on additions to midstream assets, (c) $440.3 million for the acquisition of mineral interests, (d) $1.4 billion on leasehold acquisitions, (e) $6.8 million for the purchase of other property and equipment and (f) $110.7 million on investment in real estate.

second amended and restated credit facility our credit agreement dated november 1, 2013, as amended and restated, with a syndicate of banks, including wells fargo, as administrative agent, and its affiliate wells fargo securities, llc, as sole book runner and lead arranger, provides for a revolving credit facility in the maximum credit amount of $5.0 billion, subject to a borrowing base based on our oil and natural gas reserves and other factors (the "borrowing base"). the borrowing base is scheduled to be redetermined, under certain circumstances, annually with an effective date of may 1st, and, under certain circumstances, semi-annually with effective dates of may 1st and november 1st. in addition, we and wells fargo each may request up to two interim redeterminations of the borrowing base during any 12-month period. as of december 31, 2018, the borrowing base was set at $2.65 billion, we had elected a commitment amount of $2.0 billion and we had borrowings of $1.5 billion outstanding under the revolving credit facility, of which approximately $559.0 million was used to by us to repay in full all borrowings under energen's credit facility outstanding prior to the effective time of the merger.
diamondback o&g llc is the borrower under our credit agreement. as of december 31, 2018, the credit agreement is guaranteed by us, diamondback e&p llc, rattler midstream operating llc (formerly known as rattler midstream llc) and energen corporation and its subsidiaries and will also be guaranteed by any of our future subsidiaries that are classified as restricted subsidiaries under the credit agreement. the credit agreement is also secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of diamondback o&g llc and the guarantors.
the outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a per annum rate elected by us that is equal to an alternative base rate (which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and 3-month libor plus 1.0%) or libor, in each case plus the applicable margin. the applicable margin ranges from 0.25% to 1.25% in the case of the alternative base rate and from 1.25% to 2.25% in the case of libor, in each case depending on the amount of loans and letters of credit outstanding in relation to the commitment, which is defined as the least of the maximum credit amount, the borrowing base and the elected commitment amount. we are obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0.375% to 0.500% per year on the unused portion of the borrowing base, which fee is also dependent on the amount of loans and letters of credit outstanding in relation to the commitment. loan principal may be optionally repaid from time to time without premium or penalty (other than customary libor breakage), and is required to be repaid (a) to the extent the loan amount exceeds the commitment or the borrowing base, whether due to a borrowing base redetermination or otherwise (in some cases subject to a cure period), (b) in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds from the sale of property when a borrowing base deficiency or event of default exists under the credit agreement and (c) at the maturity date of november 1, 2022.
the credit agreement contains various affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants. these covenants, among other things, limit additional indebtedness, additional liens, sales of assets, mergers and consolidations, dividends and distributions, transactions with affiliates and entering into certain swap agreements and require the maintenance of the financial ratios described below.
financial covenant                                                           required ratio ratio of total net debt to ebitdax, as defined in the credit agreement       not greater than 4.0 to 1.0
ratio of current assets to liabilities, as defined in the credit agreement   not less than 1.0 to 1.0
the covenant prohibiting additional indebtedness allows for the issuance of unsecured debt in the form of senior or senior subordinated notes if no default would result from the incurrence of such debt after giving effect thereto and if, in connection with any such issuance, the borrowing base is reduced by 25% of the stated principal amount of each such issuance.
as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our revolving credit facility. the lenders may accelerate all of the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default. the credit agreement contains customary events of default, including non-payment, breach of covenants, materially incorrect representations, cross-default, bankruptcy and change of control. with certain specified exceptions, the terms and provisions of our revolving credit facility generally may be amended with the consent of the lenders holding a majority of the outstanding loans or commitments to lend.
viper's facility-wells fargo bank on july 8, 2014, viper entered into a secured revolving credit agreement, or revolving credit facility, with wells fargo, as administrative agent, certain other lenders, and the operating company, as guarantor. on may 8, 2018, the operating company
assumed all liabilities as borrower under the credit agreement and viper became a guarantor of the credit agreement. on july 20, 2018, the operating company, viper, wells fargo and the other lenders amended and restated the credit agreement to reflect the assumption by the operating company. the credit agreement, as amended and restated, provides for a revolving credit facility in the maximum credit amount of $2.0 billion and a borrowing base based on viper's oil and natural gas reserves and other factors (the "borrowing base") of $555.0 million, subject to scheduled semi-annual and other borrowing base redeterminations. the borrowing base is scheduled to be re-determined semi-annually with effective dates of may 1st and october 26th. in addition, the operating company and wells fargo each may request up to three interim redeterminations of the borrowing base during any 12-month period. as of december 31, 2018, the borrowing base was set at $555.0 million, and viper had $411.0 million of outstanding borrowings and $144.0 million available for future borrowings under its revolving credit facility.
the outstanding borrowings under viper's credit agreement bear interest at a per annum rate elected by the operating company that is equal to an alternate base rate (which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% and 3-month libor plus 1.0%) or libor, in each case plus the applicable margin. the applicable margin ranges from 0.75% to 1.75% per annum in the case of the alternate base rate and from 1.75% to 2.75% per annum in the case of libor, in each case depending on the amount of loans and letters of credit outstanding in relation to the commitment, which is defined as the lesser of the maximum credit amount and the borrowing base. the operating company is obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0.375% to 0.500% per year on the unused portion of the commitment, which fee is also dependent on the amount of loans and letters of credit outstanding in relation to the commitment. loan principal may be optionally repaid from time to time without premium or penalty (other than customary libor breakage), and is required to be repaid (a) to the extent the loan amount exceeds the commitment or the borrowing base, whether due to a borrowing base redetermination or otherwise (in some cases subject to a cure period), (b) in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds from the sale of property when a borrowing base deficiency or event of default exists under the credit agreement and (c) at the maturity date of november 1, 2022. the loan is secured by substantially all of the assets of viper and the operating company.
the viper credit agreement contains various affirmative, negative and financial maintenance covenants. these covenants, among other things, limit additional indebtedness, additional liens, sales of assets, mergers and consolidations, dividends and distributions, transactions with affiliates and entering into certain swap agreements and require the maintenance of the financial ratios described below:
financial covenant                                                           required ratio ratio of total net debt to ebitdax, as defined in the credit agreement       not greater than 4.0 to 1.0
ratio of current assets to liabilities, as defined in the credit agreement   not less than 1.0 to 1.0
the covenant prohibiting additional indebtedness allows for the issuance of unsecured debt of up to $400.0 million in the form of senior unsecured notes and, in connection with any such issuance, the reduction of the borrowing base by 25% of the stated principal amount of each such issuance. a borrowing base reduction in connection with such issuance may require a portion of the outstanding principal of the loan to be repaid.
the lenders may accelerate all of the indebtedness under the revolving credit facility upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default. the credit agreement contains customary events of default, including non-payment, breach of covenants, materially incorrect representations, cross-default, bankruptcy and change of control. there are no cure periods for events of default due to non-payment of principal and breaches of negative and financial covenants, but non-payment of interest and breaches of certain affirmative covenants are subject to customary cure periods.
capital requirements and sources of liquidity our board of directors approved a 2019 capital budget for drilling and infrastructure of $2.7 billion to $3.0 billion, representing an increase of 85% over our 2018 capital budget. we estimate that, of these expenditures, approximately:
•   $2.3 billion to $2.55 billion will be spent on drilling and completing 290 to 320 gross (255 to 280 net) horizontal wells across our operated leasehold acreage in the northern midland and southern delaware basins, with an average lateral length of approximately 9,400 feet;
•   $175.0 million to $200.0 million will be spent on infrastructure and other expenditures, excluding the cost of any leasehold and mineral interest acquisitions.
during the year ended december 31, 2018, our aggregate capital expenditures for drilling and infrastructure were $1.5 billion. we do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we spent approximately $1.4 billion in cash on acquisitions of leasehold interests and mineral acres.
the amount and timing of our capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within our control. we could choose to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the success of our drilling activities, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas, the availability of necessary equipment, infrastructure and capital, the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals, seasonal conditions, drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest owners. we are currently operating 21 horizontal rigs and eight completion crews and currently intend to operate between 18 and 22 drilling rigs in 2019 across our asset base in the midland and delaware basins. we will continue monitoring commodity prices and overall market conditions and can adjust our rig cadence up or down in response to changes in commodity prices and overall market conditions.
based upon current oil and natural gas price and production expectations for 2019, we believe that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations through year-end 2019. however, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices, and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties. further, our 2019 capital expenditure budget does not allocate any funds for leasehold and mineral interest acquisitions.
we monitor and adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to success or lack of success in drilling activities, changes in prices, availability of financing, drilling and acquisition costs, industry conditions, the timing of regulatory approvals, the availability of rigs, contractual obligations, internally generated cash flow and other factors both within and outside our control. if we require additional capital, we may seek such capital through traditional reserve base borrowings, joint venture partnerships, production payment financing, asset sales, offerings of debt and or equity securities or other means. we cannot assure you that the needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to curtail our drilling programs, which could result in a loss of acreage through lease expirations. in addition, we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves. if there is a decline in commodity prices, our revenues, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity and reserves may be materially and adversely affected.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2018:

(1)   includes the outstanding principal amount under the revolving credit facilities, the table does not include interest expense or other fees payable under this floating rate facility as we cannot predict the timing of future borrowings and repayments or interest rates to be charged.
(3)   includes only the minimum amount of interest and commitment fees due which, as of december 31, 2018, includes a commitment fee equal to 0.375% per year of the unused portion of the borrowing base of viper's credit agreement.
(4)   amounts represent our estimates of future asset retirement obligations. because these costs typically extend many years into the future, estimating these future costs requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including the rate of inflation, changing technology and the political and regulatory environment. see note 7-asset retirement obligations of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
(5)   drilling commitments represent future minimum expenditure commitments for drilling rig services under contracts to which the company was a party on december 31, 2018.
(6)   operating lease obligations represent future commitments for building, equipment and vehicle leases.
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. below, we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments. we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements. see note 2-summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
use of estimates certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated by our management, requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. actual results could differ from those estimates.
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis, using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances. nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include estimates of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom, the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties, asset retirement obligations, the fair value determination of acquired assets and liabilities, equity-based compensation, fair value estimates of commodity derivatives and estimates of income taxes.
method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting. accordingly, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties, including the costs of abandoned properties, dry holes, geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized. we also capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment. internal costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management's estimate of costs incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities. all internal costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred. sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change. income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest, to the extent they exceed related costs incurred, are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties. depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method, whereby capitalized costs plus estimated future development costs are amortized over total proved reserves.
costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves. we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on an annual basis for possible impairment. we assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant. the assessment includes consideration of the following factors, among others: intent to drill; remaining lease term; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and activity; the assignment of proved reserves; and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization.
oil and natural gas reserve quantities and standardized measure of future net revenue our independent engineers and technical staff prepare our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues. the sec has defined proved reserves as the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. as a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time. although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates. if such changes are material, they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material.
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves. oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate. accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
revenue recognition revenue from contracts with customers sales of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are recognized at the point control of the product is transferred to the customer. virtually all of the pricing provisions in our contracts are tied to a market index, with certain adjustments based on, among other factors, whether a well delivers to a gathering or transmission line, the quality of the oil or natural gas and the prevailing supply and demand conditions. as a result, the price of the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids fluctuates to remain competitive with other available oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids supplies.
oil sales our oil sales contracts are generally structured where it delivers oil to the purchaser at a contractually agreed-upon delivery point at which the purchaser takes custody, title and risk of loss of the product. under this arrangement, we or a third party transports the product to the delivery point and receives a specified index price from the purchaser with no deduction. in this scenario, we recognize revenue when control transfers to the purchaser at the delivery point based on the price received from the purchaser. oil revenues are recorded net of any third-party transportation fees and other applicable differentials in our consolidated statements of operations.
natural gas and natural gas liquids sales under our natural gas processing contracts, it delivers natural gas to a midstream processing entity at the wellhead, battery facilities or the inlet of the midstream processing entity's system. the midstream processing entity gathers and processes the natural gas and remits proceeds to us for the resulting sales of natural gas liquids and residue gas. in these scenarios, we evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent in the transaction. for those contracts where we have concluded it is the principal and the ultimate third party is its customer, we recognize revenue on a gross basis, with transportation, gathering, processing, treating and compression fees presented as an expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
in certain natural gas processing agreements, we may elect to take its residue gas and/or natural gas liquids in-kind at the tailgate of the midstream entity's processing plant and subsequently market the product. through the marketing process, we deliver product to the ultimate third-party purchaser at a contractually agreed-upon delivery point and receives a specified index price from the purchaser. in this scenario, we recognize revenue when control transfers to the purchaser at the delivery point based on the index price received from the purchaser. the gathering, processing, treating and compression fees attributable to the gas processing contract, as well as any transportation fees incurred to deliver the product to the purchaser, are presented as transportation, gathering, processing, treating and compression expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
midstream revenue substantially all revenues from gathering, compression, water handling, disposal and treatment operations are derived from intersegment transactions for services rattler midstream operating llc, or rattler provides to exploration and production operations. the portion of such fees shown in our consolidated financial statements represent amounts charged to interest owners in our operated wells, as well as fees charged to other third parties for water handling and treatment services provided by rattler or usage of rattler's gathering and compression systems. for gathering and compression revenue, rattler satisfies its performance obligations and recognizes revenue when low pressure volumes are delivered to a specified delivery point. revenue is recognized based on the per mmbtu gathering fee or a per barrel gathering fee charged by rattler in accordance with the gathering and compression agreement. for water handling and treatment revenue, rattler satisfies its performance obligations and recognizes revenue when the fresh water volumes have been delivered to the fracwater meter for a specified well pad and the wastewater volumes have been metered downstream of our facilities. for services contracted through third party providers, rattler's performance obligation is satisfied when the service performed by the third party provider has been completed. revenue is recognized based on the per barrel fresh water delivery or a wastewater gathering and disposal fee charged by rattler in accordance with the water services agreement.
the majority of our midstream revenue agreements have a term greater than one year, and as such rattler has utilized the practical expedient in asc 606, which states that we are not required to disclose the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations if the variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation. under our revenue agreements, each delivery generally represents a separate performance obligation; therefore, future volumes delivered are wholly unsatisfied and disclosure of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is not required.
the remainder of our midstream revenue agreements, which relate to agreements with third parties, are short-term in nature with a term of one year or less. rattler has utilized an additional practical expedient in asc 606 which exempts it from disclosure of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations if the performance obligation is part of an agreement that has an original expected duration of one year or less.
contract balances under our product sales contracts, we have the right to invoice our customers once the performance obligations have been satisfied, at which point payment is unconditional. accordingly, our product sales contracts do not give rise to contract assets or liabilities under accounting standards codification 606.
impairment we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. under this method, all acquisition, exploration and development costs, including certain internal costs, are capitalized and amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves. internal costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management's estimate of costs incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities. all internal costs not directly associated with exploration and development activities were charged to expense as they were incurred. costs
associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves. the inclusion of our unevaluated costs into the amortization base is expected to be completed within three to five years. sales of oil and natural gas properties, whether or not being amortized currently, are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized, unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas.
under this method of accounting, we are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter. the test determines a limit, or ceiling, on the book value of the proved oil and natural gas properties. net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of deferred income taxes, or the cost center ceiling. the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of (a) estimated future net revenues, discounted at 10% per annum, from proved reserves, based on the trailing 12-month unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month price, adjusted for any contract provisions and excluding the estimated abandonment costs for properties with asset retirement obligations recorded on the balance sheet, (b) the cost of properties not being amortized, if any, and (c) the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized, including related deferred taxes for differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties. if the net book value, including related deferred taxes, exceeds the ceiling, an impairment or non-cash writedown is required.
asset retirement obligations we measure the future cost to retire our tangible long-lived assets and recognize such cost as a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction or normal operation of a long-lived asset. the fair value of a liability for an asset's retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and the corresponding cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. the liability is accreted to its then present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount, the difference is recorded in oil and natural gas properties.
our asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the future plugging and abandonment of wells and related facilities. estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. we estimate the future plugging and abandonment costs of wells, the ultimate productive life of the properties, a risk-adjusted discount rate and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation. to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and natural gas property balance.
derivatives from time to time, we have used energy derivatives for the purpose of mitigating the risk resulting from fluctuations in the market price of crude oil and natural gas. we recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship. none of our derivatives were designated as hedging instruments during the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings during the period of change.
accounting for equity-based compensation we grant various types of equity-based awards including stock options and restricted stock units. these plans and related accounting policies are defined and described more fully in note 11-equity-based compensation of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the form 10-k. stock compensation awards are measured at fair value on the date of grant and are expensed, net of estimated forfeitures, over the required service period.
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of (1) temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and (2) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the
period the rate change is enacted. a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
investments viper has an equity interest in a limited partnership that is so minor that viper has no influence over the limited partnership's operating and financial policies. this interest was acquired during the year ended december 31, 2014 and was accounted for under the cost method. effective january 1, 2018, viper adopted accounting standards update 2016-01 which requires viper to measure this investment at fair value which resulted in a downward adjustment of $18.7 million to record the impact of this adoption. for the year ended december 31, 2018, viper recorded a loss of $0.6 million. viper's investment balance as of december 31, 2018 was $14.5 million, which is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
funds held in escrow the funds held in escrow represent amounts in deposit to fund acquisitions. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we did not have any funds held in escrow. during the year ended december 31, 2017, there was $6.3 million in deposit to fund other acquisitions which closed in the first quarter of 2018.
recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted pronouncements in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers". this standard included a five-step revenue recognition model to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. among other things, the standard also eliminated industry-specific revenue guidance, required enhanced disclosures about revenue, provided guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively and improved guidance for multiple-element arrangements. we adopted this accounting standards update effective january 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. we utilized a bottom-up approach to analyze the impact of the new standard by reviewing our current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements of the new standard to our revenue contracts and the impact of adopting this standards update on our total revenues, operating income and our consolidated balance sheet. the adoption of this standard did not result in a cumulative-effect adjustment.
in january 2016, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 2016-01, "financial instruments-overall". this update applies to any entity that holds financial assets or owes financial liabilities. this update requires equity investments (except for those accounted for under the equity method or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. we adopted this standard effective january 1, 2018 by means of a negative cumulative-effect adjustment totaling $18.7 million.
in february 2016, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 2016-02, "leases". this update applies to any entity that enters into a lease, with some specified scope exemptions. under this update, a lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. while there were no major changes to the lessor accounting, changes were made to align key aspects with the revenue recognition guidance. this update will be effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. entities will be required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. we enter into lease agreements to support its operations. these agreements are for leases on assets such as office space, vehicles and compressors. we have completed the process of reviewing and determining the contracts to which this new guidance applies. upon adoption, on january 1, 2019, we recognized approximately $13.6 million of right-of-use assets, of which the total amount relates to our operating leases.
in january 2018, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 2018-01, "leases - land easement practical expedient for transition to topic 842". this update applies to any entity that holds land easements. the update allows entities to adopt a practical expedient to not evaluate existing or expired land easements under topic 842 that were not previously accounted for as leases under the current leases guidance. an entity that elects this practical expedient should evaluate new or modified land easements under topic 842 beginning at the date that the entity adopts topic 842. we adopted this standard effective january 1, 2019. the adoption of this update did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
in july 2018, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 2018-10, "codification improvements to topic 842, leases". this update provides clarification and corrects unintended application of certain sections in the new lease guidance. this update will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. the adoption of this update did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
in july 2018, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 2018-11, "lease (topic 842): targeted improvements". this update provides another transition method of allowing entities to initially apply the new lease standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. this update will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. we adopted this standard as of january 1, 2019. the primary impact of adopting this standard is the recognition of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for current operating leases.
in december 2018, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 2018-20, "leases (topic 842) - narrow-scope improvements for lessors". this update provides a practical expedient for lessors to elect not to evaluate whether sales taxes and other similar taxes are lessor costs. the update also requires a lessor to exclude from variable payments those costs paid directly by the lessee to third parties and include lessor costs paid by the lessor and reimbursed by the lessee. we adopted this update effective january 1, 2019. the adoption of this standard did not have an effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
in august 2016, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update 2016-15, "statement of cash flows - classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments". this update applies to all entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows. this update provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies; including bank-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. we adopted this update effective january 1, 2018 using the retrospective transition method. adoption of this standard did not have an effect on the presentation on the statement of cash flows.

inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years, it is still a factor in the united states economy and we tend to experience inflationary pressure on the cost of oilfield services and equipment as increasing oil and gas prices increase drilling activity in our areas of operations.
off-balance sheet arrangements we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2018. please read note 17-commitments and contingencies included in notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k, for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies, some of which are not recognized in the balance sheets under gaap.

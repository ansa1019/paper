in order to meet the demands of consumers, we continually introduce new products, support new and established products through advertising, merchandising and sampling and phase out existing products that no longer meet the needs of our consumers or our objectives.  the economics of developing, producing, launching, supporting and discontinuing products impact our sales and operating performance each period.  the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products, which we take into account in our business planning.
non-gaap financial measures we use certain non-gaap financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business.  management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between periods.  while we consider the non-gaap measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap.  see reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures beginning on page 39 for reconciliations between non-gaap financial measures and the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures.
we operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net sales generated outside the united states.  accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations.  therefore, we present certain net sales, operating results and diluted net earnings per common share information excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business outside the united states.  constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period.  we calculate constant currency information by translating current year results using prior year weighted-average foreign currency exchange rates.
overview we believe the best way to increase stockholder value is to continue providing superior products and services in the most efficient and effective manner while recognizing consumers changing behaviors and shopping preferences.  accordingly, our long-term strategy has numerous initiatives across geographic regions, product categories, brands, channels of distribution and functions designed to grow our sales, provide cost efficiencies, leverage our strengths and make us more productive and profitable.  we plan to build upon and leverage our history of outstanding creativity and innovation, high quality products and services, and engaging communications while investing for long-term sustainable growth.
our balanced, diverse and highly desirable brand portfolio positions us well to capitalize on opportunities in fast growing and profitable areas of prestige beauty.  we believe that our broad and inclusive range of prestige product offerings allows us to increase our share of a consumers beauty routine and source consumers from brands sold in mass-market distribution.
·                  in fiscal 2018, we have seen a resurgence of global prestige skin care growth.  our skin care product category benefited from the enduring strength of hero product lines such as advanced night repair from estée lauder and crème de la mer from la mer, as well as recent product launches and targeted expanded consumer reach.  the launches of advanced night repair eye concentrate matrix and perfectionist pro rapid firm + lift treatment from estée lauder were particularly successful in china and certain travel retail locations in asia/pacific.  during fiscal 2018, we continued to expand the crème de la mer and genaissance de la mer product lines from la mer through the introduction of the moisturizing matte lotion, the moisturizing cool gel creme, the eye & expression cream and the infused lotion.
·                  global prestige makeup sales also continued to grow; however, the pace was slower than in prior periods.  we continued to benefit from growth in hero product lines such as double wear and pure color envy from estée lauder as well as incremental net sales from too faced and becca, which we acquired during fiscal 2017.  most of our brands also benefited from strong demand for makeup, particularly in china and hong kong.
·                  our fragrance category continues to benefit from increased sales of our luxury fragrance brands.  new product lines, such as the english fields collection from jo malone london and the oud wood franchise from tom ford, as well as strength in certain existing product lines, have contributed to our success in the category.  the category also benefited from strong growth and targeted expanded consumer reach of le labo and by kilian.  increased interest in luxury fragrances in asia has also helped category growth.  we look for further opportunities to strengthen our business in this category there through targeted expanded consumer reach of our luxury brands.
·                  in our hair care category, our brands are reaching new consumers globally as we further expanded our presence in the travel retail, online and specialty-multi channels, such as the launch of bumble and bumble in ulta beauty.  during fiscal 2018, the invati advanced product line launch from aveda also contributed to the success in the category.
our global footprint provides many avenues of potential growth.  our regional organizations, and the expertise of our people there, enable our brands to be more locally and culturally relevant in both product assortment and communications.  we are evolving the way we connect with our consumers in stores, online and where they travel, including by expanding our digital and social media presence and the engagement of global and local influencers to amplify brand or product stories.  we tailor our strategy by market to drive consumer engagement and embrace an authentic understanding of cultural diversity.  we continuously strengthen our presence in large, image-building core markets, such as the united states, the united kingdom and japan, and broaden our presence in emerging markets, including those in the middle east, india, russia, south africa, brazil and mexico.
·                  in north america, we continue to deploy a number of strategies to accelerate growth, despite a challenging environment especially in brick and mortar retail, and in latin america, we continue to launch new brands, expand social media outreach and encourage consumers to trade up from mass beauty products.
·                  in europe, the middle east & africa, we are expanding the consumer reach of many of our brands, strengthening their digital and social media presence and leveraging our strength in the makeup category to gain share in prestige beauty.
·                  in asia/pacific, particularly in china, we are leveraging our diversified brand portfolio and expansion on third-party online platforms to benefit from the strong consumer demand for prestige beauty.
we approach distribution strategically by product category and geographic region and seek to optimize distribution by matching each of our brands with appropriate opportunities while maintaining high productivity per door.  we are expanding certain brands into geographic markets where we see opportunities to fuel our sales growth.  this includes adding brands to higher growth channels, such as travel retail, third-party online platforms, e- and m-commerce and specialty-multi brand retailers.  we also focus on brand-building retail activities that will expand consumer coverage for our brands.
·                  as part of this strategy, we continue to build and diversify our business in the travel retail channel around the world across brands and product categories.  travel retail continues to be an important channel for brand building and profit margin expansion due to the increase in traveling consumers, particularly those from china, across multiple travel corridors.  we continue to invest in digital and social media platforms and advertising, while focusing on locally relevant product assortment and communication skills of our representatives.  at the same time, travel retail is susceptible to a number of external factors, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and consumers willingness and ability to travel and spend.
·                  online net sales continue to grow strongly on a global basis, and we continue to launch e- and m-commerce sites in new and existing markets directly with our retail customers or on select third-party online platforms.  we collaborate with our retailers and third-party online platforms globally to drive sales of our products on their online sites.  we believe our success in delivering particularly strong online growth is a result of customization of our strategy to meet local market and cultural needs.  we also continue to develop and implement omnichannel concepts to deliver an integrated consumer experience and better serve consumers as they shop across channels.
while our business is performing well overall, we continue to face strong competition globally and economic challenges in certain countries.  in particular, we are cautious of the continued decline in retail traffic primarily related to certain brick-and-mortar stores in the united states and the united kingdom as a result of the impact of shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop.  we are also cautious of foreign currency movements, including their impact on tourism.  additionally, we continue to monitor the effects of the macroeconomic environments in certain countries such as brazil and in the middle east; the united kingdoms anticipated exit from the european union; social and political issues; regulatory matters, including the imposition of tariffs; geopolitical tensions; and global security issues.
we believe we can, to some extent, offset the impact of these challenges by developing and pursuing a diversified strategy with multiple engines of growth and accelerating areas of strength among our geographic regions, product categories, brands and channels of distribution.  however, if economic conditions or the degree of uncertainty or volatility worsen, or the adverse conditions previously described are further prolonged, there could be a negative effect on consumer confidence, demand, spending and willingness or ability to travel and, as a result, on our business.  we will continue to monitor these and other risks that may affect our business.
as disclosed in the companys form 10-q for the fiscal 2018 third quarter, we learned that some of our testing related to certain product advertising claims did not meet our standards, necessitating further validation.  as a result of this ongoing review, certain advertising claims are being modified.  this is not a product safety issue and does not relate to the quality of the ingredients or the manufacturing of our products.  based on our review to date, we do not believe this matter will be material to the company.
we navigate through short-term volatility while focusing on our long-term strategy and using our multiple engines of growth that we believe will help promote sustainable results.  we are increasing our presence in emerging markets, continuing efforts to revitalize and accelerate growth in our heritage brands, focusing on key demographics and seeking opportunities to add to our diverse brand portfolio.  we are also strengthening our consumer engagement by leveraging digital marketing and enhancing our social media strategies and execution.  we will continue to drive product, packaging, and conceptual innovation and creativity that we believe enable us to introduce products that resonate with consumers.  some initiatives will involve new sub-categories, and others may expand key franchises.
leading beauty forward in may 2016, we announced a multi-year initiative (leading beauty forward, or the program) to build on our strengths and better leverage our cost structure to free resources for investment to continue our growth momentum.  leading beauty forward is designed to enhance our go-to-market capabilities, reinforce our leadership in global prestige beauty and continue creating sustainable value.  we plan to approve specific initiatives under leading beauty forward through fiscal 2019 related to the optimization of select corporate functions, supply chain activities, and corporate and regional market support structures, as well as the exit of underperforming businesses, and expect to complete those initiatives through fiscal 2021.  we previously estimated that leading beauty forward would result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $600 million and $700 million, before taxes.  after reviewing additional potential initiatives and the progress of previously approved initiatives under leading beauty forward that are being implemented, we have revised our estimates for cost approvals under the program.  inclusive of approvals from inception through june 30, 2018, we now estimate that leading beauty forward may result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $900 million and $950 million, before taxes, consisting of employee-related costs, asset write-offs and other costs to implement these initiatives.  as many of our previously approved leading beauty forward initiatives are progressing through their implementation stages and with the identification of potential new initiatives, we are revising our previous estimate of annual net benefits of between $200 million and $300 million, before taxes.  after its full implementation, we now expect leading beauty forward to yield annual net benefits, primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses, of between $350 million and $450 million, before taxes.  these savings can be used to improve margin, mitigate risk and invest in future growth initiatives.  for additional information about restructuring and other charges, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 7  charges associated with restructuring and other activities.
annual impairment testing we assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist.  during fiscal 2018, no impairment charges were recognized as a result of our annual goodwill and other intangible asset impairment testing as of april 1, 2018. the fair values of all reporting units with material goodwill were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values.
with regard to trademarks, the fair value of the editions de parfums frédéric malle trademark was equal to its carrying value, and the fair value of the too faced trademark exceeded its carrying value by approximately 14%.  as of june 30, 2018, the carrying values of the editions de parfums frédéric malle and too faced trademarks were $33 million and $525 million, respectively.  if these reporting units are adversely affected by a softness in the retail environment for their products, or if other business disruptions arise that cause a change to their long-term financial projections, there could be a negative effect on the fair values of the related trademarks, and it is possible we could recognize an impairment charge in the future.
based on our annual goodwill and other intangible asset impairment testing during fiscal 2017, we recorded impairment charges related to the goodwill and trademark of the editions de parfums frédéric malle reporting unit, and impairment charges for the remaining goodwill and intangible assets related to the rodin olio lusso reporting unit, of $31 million combined.  for additional information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 6  goodwill and other intangible assets.

reported net sales in fiscal 2018 increased in each major product category and grew in each geographic region.  each of our product categories and certain of our geographic regions benefited from targeted expanded consumer reach and new product offerings, which primarily reflected growth from the travel retail, online (including third-party online platforms) and specialty-multi channels.  our skin care product category primarily benefited from net sales increases from estée lauder and la mer.  net sales increases from estée lauder, tom ford and mac, as well as incremental, and higher comparable, net sales from our fiscal 2017 acquisitions of too faced and becca, drove the net sales growth in our makeup category.  our fragrance category benefited primarily from net sales increases from jo malone london, tom ford, le labo and by kilian.  hair care net sales growth was driven by aveda.
the fiscal 2018 reported net sales increase benefited from $325 million of favorable foreign currency translation.
reported net sales in fiscal 2017 increased in each major product category, except hair care, and grew in each geographic region.  skin care net sales primarily benefited from higher sales of la mer products.  incremental net sales from our fiscal 2017 second quarter acquisitions of too faced and becca, as well as net sales increases from tom ford, estée lauder and smashbox, drove growth in the makeup product category.  our fragrance category primarily benefited from net sales increases from jo malone london.  increased net sales from our fiscal 2016 and 2015 acquisitions of glamglow, by kilian, le labo and editions de parfums frédéric malle, also contributed to growth in our skin care and fragrance categories.  the net sales decrease in our hair care category primarily reflected a difficult comparison with fiscal 2016 that featured greater launch activity.  each of our product categories benefited from targeted expanded consumer reach, new product offerings and growth from emerging markets and in the specialty-multi and online channels.
the fiscal 2017 reported net sales increase was adversely affected by approximately $187 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.
returns associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to our product categories or geographic regions because they result from activities that are deemed a company-wide initiative to redesign, resize and reorganize select corporate functions and go-to-market structures.  accordingly, the following discussions of net sales by product categories and geographic regions exclude the fiscal 2018 and 2017 impact of returns associated with restructuring and other activities of approximately $8 million and $2 million, respectively.

reported skin care net sales increased in fiscal 2018, reflecting higher net sales from estée lauder and la mer of approximately $890 million, combined, partially offset by lower net sales from aveda of approximately $16 million.  the higher net sales from estée lauder reflected growth in europe, the middle east & africa and asia/pacific, primarily due to increases in travel retail and china.  the increase in estée lauders sales also benefited from the launch of advanced night repair eye concentrate matrix and growth in other advanced night repair products, the launch of perfectionist pro rapid firm + lift treatment and growth in the micro essence line of products.  net sales of la mer products grew in all regions, reflecting recent product launches such as the moisturizing matte lotion and the moisturizing cool gel creme, the expansion of the genaissance de la mer line of products, including the eye & expression cream and the infused lotion, and targeted expanded consumer reach.  the lower net sales of aveda products primarily reflected an unfavorable comparison to the prior year due to the launch of the tulasara line of products.
the net sales increase for skin care benefited from approximately $136 million of favorable foreign currency translation.
reported skin care net sales increased in fiscal 2017, reflecting higher net sales from la mer, glamglow, estée lauder, bobbi brown and origins of approximately $157 million, combined, partially offset by lower net sales from clinique and mac of approximately $93 million, combined.  higher net sales from la mer were primarily due to targeted expanded consumer reach in the americas region and in our travel retail business, and the increase in net sales from glamglow reflected incremental sales from additional product assortments and targeted expanded consumer reach.  higher net sales from estée lauder were partially due to net sales growth in our travel retail business and in china resulting from higher net sales of the advanced night repair and revitalizing supreme lines of products.  net sales growth from bobbi brown was driven by new launches including instant confidence stick and extra repair nourishing milk.  the higher net sales from origins reflected net sales growth in the asia/pacific region and in our travel retail business resulting from higher net sales of toners and facial masks.
the lower net sales of clinique products primarily reflected a soft retail environment for our products, particularly in our travel retail business, asia/pacific and, to a lesser extent, the united kingdom and brick-and-mortar department stores in the united states.  the lower net sales from mac were driven by slower retail traffic in brick-and-mortar stores in the united states reflecting the impact of shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop.
the fiscal 2017 net sales increase for skin care was adversely affected by approximately $60 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.

reported makeup net sales increased in fiscal 2018, reflecting incremental, and higher comparable, net sales from our fiscal 2017 second quarter acquisitions of too faced and becca, as well as from estée lauder, tom ford and mac of approximately $582 million, combined.  the increase in net sales of estée lauder products was driven primarily by higher sales of the double wear and pure color franchises.  net sales growth from tom ford was driven by higher sales of lipstick and eyeshadow products, in particular from our travel retail business.  higher net sales from mac was driven by growth in china and hong kong, reflecting the strength of the makeup category in those markets; growth in our travel retail business due, in part, to traveling chinese consumers; and higher online sales, including third-party online platforms as a result of the brands fiscal 2017 fourth quarter launch on tmall.
partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales of smashbox of approximately $23 million, primarily reflecting a slower retail environment for our products in the united states due to continued competitive pressures, particularly in the specialty-multi and department store channels.
the net sales increase for makeup benefited from approximately $128 million of favorable foreign currency translation.
reported makeup net sales increased in fiscal 2017, reflecting incremental net sales from our fiscal 2017 second quarter acquisitions of too faced and becca, as well as higher net sales from tom ford and estée lauder, of approximately $391 million, combined.  increased net sales from tom ford were driven by higher sales of lipstick and eyeshadow products, such as the tom ford soleil color collection.  increased net sales of estée lauder products were due, in part, to higher sales from the double wear line of products and the pure color franchise.
partially offsetting these increases were approximately $84 million of lower net sales of mac and clinique products, primarily reflecting slower retail traffic in brick-and-mortar stores in the united states.  partially offsetting these lower net sales from mac was the net sales growth of the brand in asia/pacific and in our travel retail business.
the fiscal 2017 net sales increase for makeup was adversely affected by approximately $76 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.

reported fragrance net sales increased in fiscal 2018, reflecting higher net sales from our luxury fragrance brands of approximately $215 million, combined.  contributing to the growth were higher net sales from jo malone london across all regions, primarily driven by the travel retail channel and the asia/pacific region reflecting targeted expanded consumer reach, the success of recent product launches and the increase in chinese traveling consumers.  also contributing to the increase was higher net sales from tom ford, reflecting, in part, the continued success of the private blend franchises, including new products, such as the oud wood franchise, and growth from certain existing fragrances.  net sales increased from le labo, by kilian and editions de parfums frédéric malle, reflecting growth from new and certain existing products, as well as targeted expanded consumer reach.
partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales from estée lauder of approximately $25 million, primarily due to an unfavorable comparison with greater launch activity in the prior year.
the net sales increase for fragrance benefited from approximately $52 million of favorable foreign currency translation.
reported fragrance net sales increased in fiscal 2017, primarily reflecting higher net sales from our luxury brands of approximately $172 million combined.  the higher net sales from jo malone london were, in part, due to targeted expanded consumer reach in the travel retail, department store and freestanding store channels, as well as the launch of basil & neroli.  increased net sales from tom ford reflected, in part, the continued success and growth of existing fragrances such as the signature and private blend franchises.  partially offsetting the increases was approximately $33 million of lower net sales of certain estée lauder and designer fragrances.  the lower net sales of certain estée lauder fragrances were partially due to a decline in net sales of the modern muse franchise.  lower net sales from certain designer fragrances reflected the expiration of our license agreement with coach.
the fiscal 2017 net sales increase for fragrance was adversely affected by approximately $47 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.

reported hair care net sales increased in fiscal 2018, reflecting growth from aveda primarily due to growth from salons in north america and higher net sales in the online and travel retail channels, as well as the launch of the invati advanced line of products.  the category also benefited from the increase in net sales from bumble and bumble due to specialty-multi door openings, particularly in ulta.
reported hair care net sales decreased in fiscal 2017, primarily reflecting a difficult comparison with fiscal 2016 that featured greater launch activity.

reported net sales in the americas increased in fiscal 2018, reflecting higher net sales in the united states of approximately $141 million and increased net sales in latin america and canada of $55 million, combined.  the higher net sales in the united states reflected incremental, and higher comparable, net sales from too faced and becca of approximately $217 million, combined.  net sales increases from estée lauder and la mer skin care products were more than offset by lower net sales from our makeup artist brands, clinique and smashbox.  the lower net sales from our makeup artist brands were a result of a softer retail environment impacting net sales in certain department stores and freestanding stores, partially offset by growth in the specialty-multi channel as a result of targeted expanded consumer reach from mac.  the decrease in net sales from smashbox was driven by a soft retail environment for our products in the specialty-multi and department store channels.  the lower net sales of clinique products reflected the negative impact from the liquidation and closure of certain north america retailers and, to a lesser extent, an unfavorable comparison due to the higher level of expansion within the specialty-multi channel in the prior year.  the increase in latin america and canada was driven by growth in most brands.
fiscal 2018 net sales in the americas benefited from favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $15 million.
reported net sales in the americas increased in fiscal 2017, reflecting incremental sales, primarily in the united states, from our fiscal 2017 acquisitions of too faced and becca of approximately $220 million, combined.  net sales growth from certain of our brands, including tom ford, smashbox, la mer and jo malone london, also contributed to the higher net sales in the region.  higher net sales in chile and brazil contributed an additional increase of approximately $25 million, combined.  net sales in the united states were adversely impacted by slower retail traffic in brick-and-mortar stores that particularly affected mac and our heritage brands.  this slower retail traffic reflected the impact of shifts in consumer preferences as to where and how they shop, as well as declines in tourism attributable, in part, to the strong u.s. dollar in relation to most currencies.

reported net sales in europe, the middle east & africa increased in fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting higher sales from our travel retail business and, to a lesser extent, the united kingdom and italy of approximately $902 million, combined.  in our global travel retail business, the sales growth reflected higher net sales from virtually all of our brands including estée lauder, la mer, tom ford, jo malone london and mac, driven, in part, by an increase in international passenger traffic, particularly by chinese travelers, as well as targeted expanded consumer reach and new product offerings.  the higher net sales in the united kingdom was primarily driven by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.  the net sales growth in italy was driven by mac, partially reflecting targeted expanded consumer reach, and estée lauder, primarily due to higher net sales from the advanced night repair and double wear lines of products.
partially offsetting the net sales increases were lower net sales in the middle east of approximately $86 million, primarily driven by the continuing rebalancing of inventory levels by certain of our distributors as a result of a general decrease in consumer purchases due to adverse macroeconomic conditions.
fiscal 2018 net sales in europe, the middle east & africa benefited from approximately $222 million of favorable foreign currency translation.
reported net sales in europe, the middle east & africa increased in fiscal 2017, reflecting higher net sales from our travel retail business, russia and italy of approximately $338 million, combined.  the net sales growth in our travel retail business for fiscal 2017 reflected higher net sales from tom ford, jo malone london, la mer and mac, driven, in part, by targeted expanded consumer reach and new product offerings.  the higher net sales in russia were primarily driven by increased net sales from estée lauder, clinique and bobbi brown, reflecting successful marketing and promotional activities supporting new and existing products.  russia also benefited from incremental sales from the fiscal 2016 acquisition of by kilian and the introduction of glamglow to the market during fiscal 2017.  the higher net sales in italy were primarily driven by mac.  these increases were partially offset by lower net sales in the united kingdom and the middle east of approximately $130 million, combined.  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales in the united kingdom increased, primarily driven by higher net sales from tom ford, la mer and jo malone london, reflecting an increase in tourism, as well as increased net sales from estée lauder partially due to the victoria beckham collection.  the lower net sales in the middle east were primarily driven by the impact of the macroeconomic environment on consumer purchases and the associated rebalancing of inventory levels by certain of our distributors.
fiscal 2017 net sales in europe, the middle east & africa were adversely affected by approximately $185 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, which primarily impacted the united kingdom.

reported net sales in asia/pacific increased in fiscal 2018, reflecting higher net sales in china and hong kong of approximately $588 million, combined.  the higher net sales in china were led by estée lauder, mac and la mer, and reflected, in part, targeted expanded consumer reach and continued increased demand for makeup and skin care products.  in addition, virtually all distribution channels grew, led by department stores and third-party online platforms.  the net sales growth in hong kong was primarily driven by estée lauder, la mer, mac and tom ford, reflecting an improved macroeconomic environment, an increase in tourism, targeted expanded consumer reach and the continued success of certain hero product lines.
fiscal 2018 net sales in asia/pacific benefited from favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $88 million.
reported net sales in asia/pacific increased in fiscal 2017, reflecting higher net sales in china, japan and korea of approximately $152 million, combined.  these increases were partially offset by lower net sales of approximately $8 million in hong kong.  the higher net sales in china, led by estée lauder, la mer and mac, benefited from targeted expanded consumer reach and reflected an increase in online sales from all brands, primarily driven by marketing and promotional events.  the net sales increase in japan was primarily due to higher net sales from mac, particularly of lip products, as well as jo malone london, which benefited from an increase in tourist traffic and online growth.  the net sales growth in korea reflected higher net sales from mac, particularly of lip products and the cushion compact, la mer, which benefited from the introduction of new products, and jo malone london and tom ford, resulting from targeted expanded consumer reach.  the lower net sales in hong kong were primarily driven by the decrease in chinese consumers traveling there and changes in their spending patterns, which particularly impacted the estée lauder and clinique brands and, to a lesser extent, la mer.

the unfavorable impact of fiscal 2017 acquisitions for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was due, in part, to a higher cost of sales related to too faced and becca.  in fiscal 2017, the unfavorable impact also included inventory step-up adjustments of $17 million, or approximately 10 basis points.  there was no net impact on gross margin from the mix of our business in fiscal 2018 as compared with the prior year.  the favorable impact from changes in strategic pricing and shipments of promotional items and gifts were offset by the unfavorable impact from new product introductions and market distribution, as well as higher costs from product sets, particularly in the travel retail channel.

as a percentage of net sales, operating expenses improved as compared to fiscal 2017, reflecting disciplined expense management across many areas and favorable mix shifts in the growth of our brands and channels.  selling expenses were favorable, reflecting lower demonstration costs, partially due to changes in our distribution channel mix, as well as efficiencies in our sales operations.  partially offsetting this favorability was an increase in advertising and promotional activities due to increased spend on digital advertising and social media, including costs associated with influencers, as well as investments to support targeted expanded consumer reach.

reported operating margin in fiscal 2018 increased by approximately 70 basis points as compared to fiscal 2017, as the improvement in operating expense margin was partially offset by the decrease in gross margin, as previously noted.  reported operating results and operating margin in fiscal 2018 benefited from favorable foreign currency translation of $99 million, which had the largest impact on the europe, the middle east & africa region and the skin care product category.  the unfavorable impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities was offset by the favorable changes in goodwill and other intangible asset impairments and fair value of contingent consideration.

reported operating results and operating margin in fiscal 2017 were impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $59 million, which had the largest impact on the europe, the middle east & africa region and the makeup product category.  operating margin in fiscal 2017 was flat as compared to fiscal 2016 as the decrease in gross margin was offset by our lower operating expense margin, as previously noted.  the change in operating margin was unfavorably impacted by charges associated with restructuring and other activities of approximately 60 basis points and goodwill and other intangible asset impairments of approximately 30 basis points, partially offset by the favorable changes in fair value of contingent consideration of approximately 60 basis points.  adjusting for these items, operating margin for fiscal 2017 would have increased approximately 30 basis points.

reported skin care operating income increased in fiscal 2018, primarily from estée lauder and la mer, due to higher net sales, in particular, from our travel retail business, china and hong kong.  partially offsetting these increases were declines from darphin reflecting higher investment spending to support the brands launch in china, and mac, as a result of the net sales decline in the middle east.
reported skin care operating income increased in fiscal 2017, reflecting higher results from la mer, estée lauder and clinique, partially offset by lower results from mac.  the increase in operating income from la mer and estée lauder reflected higher net sales.  the higher results from estée lauder also reflected a favorable comparison to the higher level of support spending in fiscal 2016.  the increase in operating income from clinique reflected disciplined expense management.  the lower results from mac reflected lower net sales.  skin care operating income also reflected the favorable year-over-year net impact of $10 million due to the changes in fair value of contingent consideration partially offset by the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal 2017, as previously discussed.

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents u.s. federal, foreign, state and local income taxes.  the effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the taxation of foreign income and income tax reserve adjustments, which represent changes in our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits including tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.  our effective tax rate will change based on recurring and non-recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographical mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state and local income taxes, tax reserve adjustments, the ultimate disposition of deferred tax assets relating to stock-based compensation and the interaction of various global tax strategies.  in addition, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information resulting in the recognition, derecognition or remeasurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period are recognized separately in the quarter of change.
on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the tcja).  the tcja includes broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code that impacted our accounting and reporting for income taxes in the current year, including:
·                  a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings (transition tax), which may be paid over an eight-year period.
·                  a remeasurement of u.s. net deferred tax assets.
in addition, as a result of the transition tax, we established a net deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding taxes in connection with the reversal of our indefinite reinvestment assertion related to certain foreign earnings.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 8  income taxes for further discussion relating to the tcja.

(1) all periods exclude the net impact on the effective tax rate of charges associated with restructuring and other activities and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration.  fiscal 2018 was adjusted for the impact of the provisional adjustments resulting from the enactment of the tcja.  fiscal 2017 was adjusted for the impact of the tax law change in china and goodwill and other intangible asset impairments.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 increased approximately 2,130 basis points.  the increase was primarily attributable to the impacts from the tcja including the transition tax of approximately 1,770 basis points, the impact to u.s. net deferred tax assets resulting from the statutory tax rate reduction, including the enactment date remeasurement, of approximately 270 basis points, and the establishment of a net deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding taxes on certain foreign earnings of approximately 230 basis points.  also contributing to the increase was the impact in the prior year of the tax law change in china which expanded the corporate income tax deduction allowance for advertising and promotional expenses and reduced the prior year tax rate by approximately 460 basis points.  partially offsetting these increases was approximately 250 basis points due to the favorable impact of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards.  the remaining change of approximately 350 basis points was primarily related to the favorable impact of the reduced u.s. statutory tax rate.
the effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 decreased approximately 460 basis points due to the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance (the china deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversal).  the deferred tax asset and associated valuation allowance related to the accumulated carryforward of excess advertising and promotional expenses.  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, a favorable change to the tax law in china was enacted that expanded the corporate income tax deduction allowance for advertising and promotional expenses, resulting in this change in realizability of the asset.  also contributing to this decrease was a reduction in income tax reserve adjustments of approximately 100 basis points.

reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures we use certain non-gaap financial measures, among other financial measures, to evaluate our operating performance, which represent the manner in which we conduct and view our business.  management believes that excluding certain items that are not comparable from period to period, or reflect the companys underlying ongoing business, provides transparency for such items and helps investors and others compare and analyze our operating performance from period to period.  in the future, we expect to incur charges or adjustments similar in nature to those presented below; however, the impact to the companys results in a given period may be highly variable and difficult to predict.  our non-gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by, or determined in a manner consistent with, other companies.  while we consider the non-gaap measures useful in analyzing our results, they are not intended to replace, or act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap.  the following tables present net sales, operating income and diluted net earnings per common share adjusted to exclude the impact of charges associated with restructuring and other activities; goodwill and other intangible asset impairments; the changes in the fair value of contingent consideration; the transition tax, the remeasurement of u.s. net deferred tax assets as of the tcja enactment date and the establishment of a net deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding taxes on certain foreign earnings resulting from the tcja; the china deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversal; and the effects of foreign currency translation.  the tables provide reconciliations between these non-gaap financial measures and the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures.

financial condition liquidity and capital resources overview our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations, borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program, borrowings from the issuance of long-term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks and other lenders in the united states and abroad.  at june 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,181 million compared with $1,136 million at june 30, 2017.  our cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a number of financial institutions.  to mitigate the risk of uninsured balances, we select financial institutions based on their credit ratings and financial strength and we perform ongoing evaluations of these institutions to limit our concentration risk exposure.
in addition, we purchase short- and long-term investments pursuant to our cash investment strategy.  our investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, asset diversification, and achieving appropriate returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy.  these investments are classified as available-for-sale and totaled $1,222 million and $1,498 million at june 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
our business is seasonal in nature and, accordingly, our working capital needs vary.  from time to time, we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding.  to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations, we could, subject to market conditions, issue commercial paper, issue long-term debt securities or borrow under our revolving credit facilities.
based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations, available-for-sale securities, available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations, information technology enhancements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases, restructuring initiatives, commitments and other contractual obligations on both a near-term and long-term basis.
the recently enacted tcja resulted in the transition tax on unrepatriated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and changed the tax law in ways that present opportunities to repatriate cash without additional u.s. federal income tax.  during fiscal 2018, we changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion related to certain foreign earnings and continue to analyze the indefinite reinvestment assertion on our remaining applicable foreign earnings.  our cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investment balances at june 30, 2018 include $1,068 million of cash and short- and long-term investments in offshore jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy.  we do not believe that continuing to reinvest our foreign earnings impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligations.  if these reinvested earnings were repatriated into the united states as dividends, we would be subject to state income taxes and applicable foreign taxes in certain jurisdictions.
credit ratings changes in our credit ratings will likely result in changes in our borrowing costs.  our credit ratings also impact the cost of our revolving credit facility.  downgrades in our credit ratings may reduce our ability to issue commercial paper and/or long-term debt and would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing.  a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  as of august 17, 2018, our commercial paper is rated a-1 by standard & poors and p-1 by moodys, and our long-term debt is rated a+ with a stable outlook by standard & poors and a2 with a stable outlook by moodys.
debt and access to liquidity total debt as a percent of total capitalization (excluding noncontrolling interests) decreased to 43% at june 30, 2018 from 45% at june 30, 2017, primarily due to the increase in total equity reflecting higher net earnings, partially offset by higher treasury stock purchases.

the fiscal 2018 increase in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2017 primarily reflected higher earnings before income taxes and an increase in accounts payable, primarily due to extended supplier payment terms.  also contributing to the improvement was a decrease in other assets, reflecting the collection of taxes receivable resulting from the fiscal 2017 change to the tax law in china, and an increase in other accrued and noncurrent liabilities, due in part to an increase in accrued employee incentive compensation and a change in legal accruals in the prior year.  the impact of the tcja, which lowered net earnings, contributed an increase of $351 million in other accrued and noncurrent liabilities, reflecting the transition tax, as well as $87 million, combined, relating to the decrease in u.s. net deferred tax assets due to the statutory tax rate reduction and withholding taxes on certain foreign earnings.  the transition tax may be paid over an eight-year period, of which $31 million is classified as short-term.  these charges did not have a material impact on our reported cash flows from operations as of june 30, 2018.
the fiscal 2017 increase in net cash provided by operating activities as compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings, a decrease in discretionary pension and post-retirement benefit contributions and a favorable change in accounts receivable due to the timing of shipments and collections.  these improvements were partially offset by unfavorable changes in accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of payments, and other accrued and noncurrent liabilities, related to a change in legal accruals, accrued professional fees and accrued employee incentive compensation, partially offset by advertising and promotional accruals.  the overall change in cash flows from certain working capital components was impacted by our fiscal 2017 acquisitions.
the fiscal 2018 decrease in net cash used for investing activities reflected cash paid in the fiscal 2017 second quarter related to the acquisitions of too faced and becca, and lower purchases, net of proceeds, of investments in connection with our cash investment strategy.  partially offsetting these changes was an increase in capital expenditures, primarily related to counters.
the fiscal 2017 increase in net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2017 second quarter acquisitions of too faced and becca, partially offset by lower net purchases of investments in connection with our cash investment strategy.
the fiscal 2018 change in net cash provided by (used for) financing activities primarily reflected the prior year issuance of the 2020 senior notes, 2027 senior notes and 2047 senior notes, partially offset by the repayment of the 5.55% senior notes due may 15, 2017.  the change also reflected higher treasury stock purchases, lower commercial paper borrowings and higher dividend payments in the current year.
the fiscal 2017 increase in net cash provided by financing activities reflected the issuance of the 2020 senior notes, 2027 senior notes and 2047 senior notes, partially offset by the repayment of the 2017 senior notes.  the increase also reflected lower treasury stock purchases and higher commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by higher dividend payments.

pension and post-retirement plan funding several factors influence the annual funding requirements for our pension plans.  for our domestic trust-based noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (u.s. qualified plan), we seek to maintain appropriate funded percentages.  for any future contributions to the u.s. qualified plan, we would seek to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended, (erisa) and subsequent pension legislation, and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.  for each international plan, our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations.  in addition, amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions.  the effect of our pension plan funding on future operating results will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, the number of participants electing to take lump-sum distributions, investment performance and funding decisions.
for the u.s. qualified plan, we maintain an investment strategy of matching the duration of a substantial portion of the plan assets with the duration of the underlying plan liabilities.  this strategy assists us in maintaining our overall funded ratio.  for fiscal 2018 and 2017, we met or exceeded all contribution requirements under erisa regulations for the u.s. qualified plan.  in fiscal 2018, we made a discretionary cash contribution to the u.s. qualified plan of $40 million.  as we continue to monitor the funded status, we may decide to make cash contributions to the u.s. qualified plan or our post-retirement medical plan in the united states during fiscal 2019.
the following table summarizes actual and expected benefit payments and contributions for our other pension and post-retirement plans:
non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension plan benefit payments               $23            $13             $7
international defined benefit pension plan contributions                           $25            $31            $24
post-retirement plan benefit payments                                               $7             $6             $7
commitments and contingencies certain of our business acquisition agreements include contingent consideration or earn-out provisions.  these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business.  since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business, we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition.

market risk we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of market risk management that includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.  to perform a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency forward contracts, we assess the change in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  a hypothetical 10% weakening of the u.s. dollar against the foreign exchange rates for the currencies in our portfolio would have resulted in a net decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of approximately $10 million and $26 million as of june 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  this potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures.
in addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to manage the effects of interest rate movements on our aggregate liability portfolio, including future debt issuances.  based on a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, the estimated fair value of our interest rate derivatives would decrease by approximately $24 million and $34 million as of june 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
our sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur.  it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year.  we believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities, other than operating leases, that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.
recently issued accounting standards refer to item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 2  summary of significant accounting policies for discussion regarding the impact of accounting standards that were recently issued but not yet effective, on our consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition at june 30, 2018 and our results of operations for the three fiscal years ended june 30, 2018 are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap).  the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements.  these estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates.  we consider accounting estimates to be critical if both (i) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the companys financial condition.  our most critical accounting policies relate to goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets and income taxes.
management of the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the companys board of directors.
goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets  impairment assessment goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the fair value of their underlying net assets.  other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks.  goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
when testing goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test.  for fiscal 2018 and 2017, we elected to perform the qualitative assessment for certain of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.  this qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair values of our reporting units were below carrying value.  for our other reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, a quantitative assessment was performed.  we engaged third-party valuation specialists and used industry accepted valuation models and criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management.
for further discussion of the methods used and factors considered in our estimates as part of the impairment testing for goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 2  summary of significant accounting policies.
income taxes we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate.  as the application of various tax laws relevant to our global business is often uncertain, significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions.  the provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions.
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, net operating losses, tax credit and other carryforwards.  deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates when the assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled.  we regularly review deferred tax assets for realizability and establish valuation allowances based on available evidence including historical operating losses, projected future taxable income, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and appropriate tax planning strategies.  if our assessment of the realizability of a deferred tax asset changes, an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time, while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time.
we provide tax reserves for u.s. federal, state, local and foreign tax exposures relating to periods subject to audit.  the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate.  we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon managements evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates.  for those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.  for those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.  we classify applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes.  although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in our opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures.  if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on our consolidated net earnings.
on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted the tcja, which, among other things, lowered the u.s. corporate statutory income tax rate and established a modified territorial system requiring a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
in accordance with securities and exchange commission (the sec) staff accounting bulletin 118, as of june 30, 2018, we recorded certain tcja related provisional charges using available information and estimates.  adjustments to the provisional charges will be recorded in the period in which those adjustments become reasonably estimable and/or the accounting is complete.  such adjustments may result from, among other things, future guidance, interpretations and regulatory changes from the u.s. internal revenue service, the sec, the financial accounting standards board and/or various state and local tax jurisdictions.  we will complete this analysis no later than december 22, 2018.
for further discussion of our income taxes accounting policy, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data  note 2  summary of significant accounting policies.
cautionary note regarding forward-looking information we and our representatives from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in this and other filings with the sec, in our press releases and in our reports to stockholders.  the words and phrases will likely result, expect, believe, planned, may, should, could, anticipate, estimate, project, intend, forecast or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.  these statements include our expectations regarding sales, earnings or other future financial performance and liquidity, product introductions, entry into new geographic regions, information technology initiatives, new methods of sale, our long-term strategy, restructuring and other charges and resulting cost savings, and future operations or operating results.  although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, actual results may differ materially from our expectations.  factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, without limitation:

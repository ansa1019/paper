a.under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in the utilities' new york electric and gas rate plans and the weather-normalization clause applicable to their gas businesses, revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. in general, the utilities recover on a current basis the fuel, gas purchased for resale and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full-service customers. accordingly, such costs do not generally affect con edison's results of operations.

liquidity and capital resources the companies' liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statements of cash flows and as discussed below.
the principal factors affecting con edison's liquidity are its investments in the utilities, the clean energy businesses and con edison transmission, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the utilities and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.
the principal factors affecting cecony's liquidity are its cash flows from operating activities, cash used in investing activities (including construction expenditures), the dividends it pays to con edison and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.
the companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. the companies repay their short-term borrowings using funds from long-term financings and operating activities. the utilities' cost of capital, including working capital, is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers.
each of the companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short-term and long-term cash requirements. see "the companies require access to capital markets to satisfy funding requirements," "changes to tax laws could adversely affect the companies" and "the companies also face other risks that are beyond their control" in item 1a, and "capital requirements and resources" in item 1.

(c) see "reconciliation of cash, temporary cash investments and restricted cash" in note a to the financial statements in item 8.
cash flows from operating activities the utilities' cash flows from operating activities reflect primarily their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. the volume of energy sales and deliveries is affected primarily by factors external to the utilities, such as growth of customer demand, weather, market prices for energy and economic conditions. measures that promote distributed energy resources, such as distributed generation, demand reduction and energy efficiency, also affect the volume of energy sales and deliveries. see "utility regulation - state utility regulation - new york utility industry - reforming the energy vision," "competition" and "environmental matters - climate change" in item 1. under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in the utilities' new york electric and gas rate plans, changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved may affect the timing of cash flows, but generally not net income. the prices at which the utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate plans. in general, changes in the utilities' cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows, but not net income, because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate plans. see "recoverable energy costs" in note a to the financial statements in item 8. pursuant to their rate plans, the utilities have recovered from customers a portion of the tax liability they will pay in the future as a result of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. these temporary differences affect the timing of cash flows, but not net income, as the companies are required to record deferred tax assets and liabilities at the current corporate tax rate for the temporary differences. for the utilities, the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 21 percent under the tcja results in decreased cash flows from operating activities. see "changes to tax laws could adversely affect the companies," in item 1a, "federal income tax" in note a, "rate plans" in note b, "other regulatory matters" in note b and note l to the financial statements in item 8.
net income is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. only cash transactions affect the companies' cash flows from operating activities. principal non-cash charges or credits include depreciation, deferred income tax expense and amortizations of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. non-cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling and cost reconciliation mechanisms in the utilities' new york electric and gas rate plans. see "rate plans - cecony- electric and gas" and "rate plans - o&r new york - electric and gas" in note b to the financial statements in item 8. for con edison, 2018 net income also includes a non-cash gain recognized with respect to jointly-owned renewable energy production projects upon completion of the acquisition of sempra solar holdings, llc at the clean energy businesses ($131 million). see note u to the financial statements in item 8.

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits the utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. the clean energy businesses and con edison transmission also provide such benefits to certain employees. the companies account for these benefits in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. in addition, the utilities apply the accounting rules for regulated operations to account for the regulatory treatment of these obligations (which, as described in note b to the financial statements in item 8, reconciles the amounts reflected in rates for the costs of the benefit to the costs actually incurred). in applying these accounting policies, the companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, health care cost trends and future compensation. see notes a, e and f to the financial statements in item 8 for information about the companies' pension and other postretirement benefits, the actuarial assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2018, 2017 and 2016.
the discount rate for determining the present value of future period benefit payments is determined using a model to match the durations of highly-rated (aa or higher by either moody's or s&p) corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments.
in determining the health care cost trend rate, the companies review actual recent cost trends and projected future trends.
the cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets, assumptions for future periods, contributions and benefit experience. con edison's and cecony's current estimates for 2019 are decreases, compared with 2018, in their pension and other postretirement benefits costs of $146 million and $137 million, respectively.
the following table illustrates the effect on 2019 pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial assumptions, while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant:
actuarial assumption                        change inassumption            pension          otherpostretirementbenefits   total

increase in projected benefit obligation:
a 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2019, as compared with the expected annual asset return of 7.00 percent, would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for con edison and cecony by approximately $23 million and $21 million, respectively, in 2020.
pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by con edison to which cecony, o&r, the clean energy businesses and con edison transmission make contributions for their participating employees. pension accounting by the utilities includes an allocation of plan assets.
the companies' policy is to fund their pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible, and for the utilities, to the extent these costs are recovered under their rate plans. the companies were not required to make cash contributions to the pension plan in 2018 under funding regulations and tax laws. however, cecony and o&r made discretionary contributions to the pension plan in 2018 of $434 million and $39 million, respectively. in 2019, cecony and o&r expect to make contributions to the pension plan of $301 million and $31 million, respectively. see "expected contributions" in notes e and f to the financial statements in item 8.
accounting for contingencies the accounting rules for contingencies apply to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. known material contingencies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements, include certain regulatory matters (note b), the utilities' responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, pcbs and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations (note g) and other contingencies (note h). in accordance with the accounting rules, the companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated.
the utilities recover costs for asbestos lawsuits, workers' compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans. generally, changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings.
accounting for long-lived and intangible assets the accounting rules for certain long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives require testing for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or intangible asset with a definite life is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual con edison annual report 2018   81
disposition of the asset. under the accounting rules, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value.
in january 2019, pg&e filed for reorganization under chapter 11 of the u.s. bankruptcy code. the output of con edison development's pg&e projects is sold under pg&e ppas. at december 31, 2018, con edison's consolidated balance sheet included $885 million of net non-utility plant relating to the pg&e projects, $1,125 million of intangible assets relating to the pg&e ppas, $292 million of net non-utility plant of additional projects that secure the related project debt and $1,050 million of related project debt. con edison has tested whether its net non-utility plant relating to the pg&e projects and intangible assets relating to the pg&e ppas has been impaired. based on the test, con edison has determined that there was no impairment. for other long-lived assets or intangible assets with definite lives, con edison recorded $2 million of impairment charges in 2018, and no impairment charges were recorded in 2017 or 2016. see "clean energy businesses - con edison development," in item 1 and "long-lived and intangible assets" in note a and "long-term debt" in note c to the financial statements in item 8.
accounting for goodwill in accordance with the accounting rules for goodwill and intangible assets, con edison is required to test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever there is a triggering event. the company has an option to first make a qualitative assessment that evaluates relevant events and circumstances, such as industry and market conditions, regulatory environment and financial performance. if, after applying the optional qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the company then applies a two-step, quantitative goodwill impairment test. at december 31, 2018, con edison's consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $440 million. no material impairment charges on goodwill were recognized in 2018 or 2017. con edison recognized a $15 million impairment charge in 2016. see "goodwill" in note a and note k to the financial statements in item 8.
accounting for derivative instruments the companies apply the accounting rules for derivatives and hedging to their derivative financial instruments. the companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas. the utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. the clean energy businesses have also hedged interest rate risk on certain debt securities. see "financial and commodity market risks," below and note o to the financial statements in item 8.
where the companies are required to make mark-to-market estimates pursuant to the accounting rules, the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions, and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange-traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources.
financial and commodity market risks the companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. the most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk and investment risk.
interest rate risk the companies' interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the utilities and maturing debt securities. con edison and its businesses manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. con edison and cecony estimate that at december 31, 2018, a 10 percent increase in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of $10 million. under cecony's current electric, gas and steam rate plans, variations in actual variable rate tax-exempt debt interest expense, including costs associated with the refinancing of the variable-rate tax-exempt debt, are reconciled to levels reflected in rates.
commodity price risk
con edison's commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. the utilities and the clean energy businesses apply risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. see note o to the financial statements in item 8.
con edison estimates that, as of december 31, 2018, a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $74 million for the derivative instruments used by the utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $66 million is for cecony and $8 million is for o&r. con edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. in accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. see "recoverable energy costs" in note a to the financial statements in item 8.
the clean energy businesses use a value-at-risk (var) model to assess the market price risk of their portfolio of electricity and gas commodity fixed-price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts, generating assets and commodity derivative instruments. var represents the potential change in fair value of the portfolio due to changes in market prices for a specified time period and confidence level. these businesses estimate var across their portfolio using a delta-normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level, compare the measured var results against performance due to actual prices and stress test the portfolio each quarter using an assumed 30 percent price change from forecast. since the var calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. var for the portfolio, assuming a one-day holding period, for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, was as follows:
average for the period                               $-                $-
investment risk the companies' investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans and to the investments of the clean energy businesses and con edison transmission that are accounted for under the equity method. see "application of critical accounting policies - accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits," above and notes a, e and f to the financial statements in item 8.
the companies' current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 45 to 55 percent equity securities, 33 to 43 percent debt securities and 10 to 14 percent real estate. at december 31, 2018, the pension plan investments consisted of 51 percent equity securities, 39 percent debt securities and 10 percent real estate.
for the utilities' pension and other postretirement benefit plans, regulatory accounting treatment is generally applied in accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations. in accordance with the statement of policy issued by the nyspsc and its current electric, gas and steam rate plans, cecony defers for payment to or recovery from customers the difference between the pension and other postretirement benefit expenses and the amounts for such expenses reflected in rates. generally, o&r also defers such difference pursuant to its rate plans.
environmental matters for information concerning climate change, environmental sustainability, potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and other environmental matters, see "environmental matters" in item 1 and note g to the financial statements in item 8.
impact of inflation the companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. regulation permits the utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. the impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the companies' long-term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed.
material contingencies for information concerning potential liabilities arising from the companies' material contingencies, see "application of critical accounting policies - accounting for contingencies," above, and notes b, g and h to the financial statements in item 8.

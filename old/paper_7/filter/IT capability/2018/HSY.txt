overview the overview presented below is an executive-level summary highlighting the key trends and measures on which the company's management focuses in evaluating its financial condition and operating performance. certain earnings and performance measures within the overview include financial information determined on a non-gaap basis, which aligns with how management internally evaluates the company's results of operations, determines incentive compensation, and assesses the impact of known trends and uncertainties on the business. a detailed reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measures referenced herein to their nearest comparable gaap financial measures follows this summary. for a detailed analysis of the company's operations prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"), referred to as "reported" herein, refer to the discussion and analysis in the consolidated results of operations.
in 2018, we made strong progress on our strategic initiatives, including strengthening our u.s. core confection business, expanding our snacks portfolio to capture incremental consumer occasions and optimizing the product portfolio across various international markets. we continued to generate solid operating cash flow, totaling approximately $1.6 billion in 2018, which affords the company significant financial flexibility.
in january 2018, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of amplify snack brands, inc. ("amplify"), previously a publicly traded company based in austin, texas that owns several popular better-for-you snack brands such as skinnypop, oatmega, paqui and tyrrells. amplify's anchor brand, skinnypop, is a market-leading ready-to-eat popcorn brand and is available in a wide range of food distribution channels in the united states. the business enables us to capture more consumer snacking occasions by contributing a new portfolio of brands. on july 5, 2018, we sold the tyrrells business in order to focus on the u.s. growth opportunities.
in october 2018, we completed the acquisition of pirate brands, which includes the pirate's booty, smart puffs and original tings brands, from b&g foods, inc. pirate brands offers baked, trans fat free and gluten free snacks and is available in a wide range of food distribution channels in the united states.
our full year 2018 net sales totaled $7,791.1 million, an increase of 3.7%, versus $7,515.4 million for the comparable period of 2017. excluding a 0.2% impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates, our net sales increased 3.9%. net sales growth was driven primarily by the revenue contributions from amplify and pirate brands.
our reported gross margin was 45.9% for the full year 2018, a decrease of 10 basis points compared to the full year 2017. our 2018 non-gaap gross margin was 44.0%, a decrease of 160 basis points compared to the full year 2017 due to higher freight and logistics costs, unfavorable mix and additional plant costs related to new production lines.
our full year 2018 reported operating profit and reported operating profit margin totaled $1,623.7 million and 20.8%, respectively, compared to full year 2017 reported operating profit and reported operating profit margin of $1,313.4 million and 17.5%, respectively. from a non-gaap perspective, full year 2018 adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin totaled $1,607.1 million and 20.6%, respectively, compared to full year 2017 adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin of $1,556.5 million and 20.7%, respectively. the decrease in our adjusted operating profit margin was primarily due to lower non-gaap gross margin.
our full year 2018 reported net income and reported eps-diluted totaled $1,177.6 million and $5.58, respectively, compared to full year 2017 reported net income and reported eps-diluted of $783.0 million and $3.66, respectively. from a non-gaap perspective, full year 2018 adjusted net income was $1,130.1 million, an increase of 12.8% versus adjusted net income of $1,001.5 million in 2017. our adjusted eps-diluted for the full year 2018 was $5.36 compared to $4.69 for the same period of 2017, an increase of 14.3%. the increases in our adjusted net income and adjusted eps-diluted in 2018 compared to 2017 were primarily due to slightly lower selling, marketing and administrative expenses, as well as a lower 2018 tax rate as a result of u.s. tax reform, partially offset by unfavorable gross profit.
non-gaap information comparability of certain financial measures the comparability of certain of our financial measures is impacted by unallocated mark-to-market (gains) losses on commodity derivatives, pension settlement charges relating to company-directed initiatives, costs associated with business realignment activities, costs relating to the integration of acquisitions, impairment of long-lived assets, the one-time impact of u.s. tax reform, the gain realized on the sale of a trademark and the gain recorded upon settlement of a liability in conjunction with the purchase of the remaining 20% of the outstanding shares of shanghai golden monkey food joint stock co., ltd. ("sgm").
to provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present performance, we use non-gaap financial measures within md&a that exclude the financial impact of these activities. these non-gaap financial measures are used internally by management in evaluating results of operations and determining incentive compensation, and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business, but they are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with gaap. a reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measures referenced in md&a to their nearest comparable gaap financial measures as presented in the consolidated statements of income is provided below.
explanatory note in conjunction with the adoption of asu 2017-07, compensation-retirement benefits (topic 715), in the first quarter of 2018, the company elected to discontinue its practice of excluding the non-service related components of its net periodic benefit cost in deriving its non-gaap financial measures, with a minor exception. historically, the company excluded from its non-gaap results the following components relating to its pension benefit plans: interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of net loss (gain), and settlement and curtailment charges. the company did not historically exclude from its non-gaap results the non-service related components relating to its other post retirement benefit plans. starting with the first quarter of 2018, the company will continue to exclude from its non-gaap results the portion of pension settlement and/or curtailment charges relating to company-directed initiatives, such as significant business realignment events and benefit plan terminations or amendments. as a result of this change, the non-gaap reconciliations presented for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 that follow have been revised to conform to this updated presentation. the revision in the company's determination of non-gaap earnings resulted in a reduction of $0.07 to adjusted earnings per share-diluted from $4.76 to $4.69 for 2017 and a reduction of $0.08 to adjusted earnings per share-diluted from $4.41 to $4.33 for 2016.

in the assessment of our results, we review and discuss the following financial metrics that are derived from the reported and non-gaap financial measures presented above:
for the years ended december 31,
as reported operating profit margin    20.8   %             17.5      %          16.9      %
non-gaap operating profit margin (2)   20.6   %             20.7      %          20.5      %
(1)   calculated as non-gaap gross profit as a percentage of net sales for each period presented.
(2)   calculated as non-gaap operating profit as a percentage of net sales for each period presented.
(3)   calculated as non-gaap provision for income taxes as a percentage of non-gaap income before taxes (calculated as non-gaap operating profit minus non-gaap interest expense, net plus or minus non-gaap other (income) expense, net).
details of the activities impacting comparability that are presented as reconciling items to derive the non-gaap financial measures in the tables above are as follows:
mark-to-market (gains) losses on commodity derivatives the mark-to-market (gains) losses on commodity derivatives are recorded as unallocated and excluded from adjusted results until such time as the related inventory is sold, at which time the corresponding (gains) losses are reclassified from unallocated to segment income. since we often purchase commodity contracts to price inventory requirements in future years, we make this adjustment to facilitate the year-over-year comparison of cost of sales on a basis that matches the derivative gains and losses with the underlying economic exposure being hedged for the period. for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the net adjustment recognized within unallocated was a gain of $168.3 million, a gain of $35.3 million and a loss of $163.2 million, respectively. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
business realignment activities we periodically undertake restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of ongoing efforts to enhance long-term profitability. for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred $51.8 million, $69.4 million and $93.9 million, respectively, of pre-tax costs related to business realignment activities. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
acquisition-related costs for the year ended december 31, 2018, we incurred expenses totaling $44.8 million related to the acquisitions of amplify and pirate brands. this primarily includes legal and consultant fees, as well as severance and other costs relating to the integration of the businesses. for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, we incurred expenses totaling $0.3 million and $6.5 million, respectively, related to integration of the 2016 acquisition of ripple brand collective, llc, as we incorporated this business into our operating practices and information systems.
pension settlement charges related to company-directed initiatives in 2018, settlement charges in our hourly defined benefit plan were triggered by lump sum withdrawals by employees retiring or leaving the company under a voluntary separation plan included within the operational optimization program (as defined below). in 2017, settlement charges were triggered in the pension plan benefiting our employees in puerto rico as a result of lump sum distributions and the purchase of annuity contracts relating to the termination of this plan. in 2016, settlement charges in our hourly defined benefit plan were triggered by lump sum withdrawals by employees retiring or leaving the company under a voluntary separation plan included within the 2015 productivity initiative (as defined below).
long-lived and intangible asset impairment charges for the year ended december 31, 2018, we incurred $57.7 million of pre-tax long-lived asset impairment charges to adjust the long-lived asset values of certain disposal groups, including the sgm and tyrrells businesses, the lotte shanghai foods co., ltd. joint venture and other assets. these charges represent the excess of the disposal groups' carrying values, including the related currency translation adjustment amounts realized or to be realized upon completion of the sales, over the sales values less costs to sell for the respective businesses. the fair values of the disposal groups were supported by the sales prices paid by third-party buyers or estimated sales prices based on marketing of the disposal group, when the sale has not yet been completed. for the year ended december 31, 2017, we incurred $208.7 million of pre-tax long-lived asset impairment charges related to certain business realignment activities. this included a write-down of certain intangible assets that had been recognized in connection with the 2014 sgm acquisition and a write-down of property, plant and equipment. for the year ended december 31, 2016, in connection with our 2016 annual impairment testing of other indefinite lived assets, we recognized a trademark impairment charge of $4.2 million primarily resulting from plans to discontinue a brand sold in india.
impact of u.s. tax reform during the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded a net benefit of $7.8 million as a measurement period adjustment to the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries, recorded in connection with the enactment of u.s. tax reform in december 2017. during the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a net charge of $32.5 million, which included the estimated impact of the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries offset in part by the benefit from revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities based on the new lower corporate income tax rate.
noncontrolling interest share of business realignment and impairment charges certain of the business realignment and impairment charges recorded in connection with the margin for growth program related to lotte shanghai foods co., ltd., a joint venture in which we own a 50% controlling interest. therefore, we have also adjusted for the portion of these charges included within the loss attributed to the non-controlling interest.
settlement of sgm liability in the fourth quarter of 2015, we reached an agreement with the sgm selling shareholders to reduce the originally-agreed purchase price for the remaining 20% of sgm, and we completed the purchase on february 3, 2016. in the first quarter of 2016, we recorded a $26.7 million gain relating to the settlement of the sgm liability, representing the net carrying amount of the recorded liability in excess of the cash paid to settle the obligation for the remaining 20% of the outstanding shares.
gain on sale of licensing rights during the second quarter of 2018, we recorded a $2.7 million gain on the sale of licensing rights for a non-core trademark relating to a brand marketed outside of the u.s.
constant currency net sales growth we present certain percentage changes in net sales on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange.  this measure is used internally by management in evaluating results of operations and determining incentive compensation.  we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to underlying performance in our net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on the year-to-year comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets.
to present this information for historical periods, current period net sales for entities reporting in other than the u.s. dollar are translated into u.s. dollars at the average monthly exchange rates in effect during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year, rather than at the actual average monthly exchange rates in effect during the current period of the current fiscal year. as a result, the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the comparable period of the prior fiscal year.
the following tables set forth a reconciliation between reported and constant currency growth rates for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017:

2018 compared with 2017
net sales increased 3.7% in 2018 compared with 2017, reflecting a benefit from the recent amplify and pirate brands acquisitions of 3.6% and a volume increase of 1.3%, partially offset by unfavorable price realization of 1.0% and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 0.2%. excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, our net sales increased 3.9%. consolidated volumes increased due to the acquisitions of amplify and pirate brands, as well as solid performance in select international markets, which more than offset the volume reduction resulting from the sale of sgm in july 2018. the net increase in volume was partially offset by unfavorable net price realization, which was primarily attributed to incremental trade promotional expense in the north america segment in support of 2018 programming.
2017 compared with 2016
net sales increased 1.0% in 2017 compared with 2016, reflecting favorable price realization of 0.7%, a benefit from acquisitions of 0.3%, and a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 0.2%, partially offset by a volume decrease of 0.2%. excluding foreign currency, our net sales increased 0.8% in 2017. the favorable net price realization was attributed to lower levels of trade promotional spending in both the north america and international and other segments versus the prior year. consolidated volume decreased as a result of lower sales volume in the international and other segment, primarily attributed to our china business and the softness in the modern trade channel coupled with a focus on optimizing our product offerings. these volume decreases were partially offset by higher sales volume in north america, specifically from 2017 innovation and new launches, including hershey's cookie layer crunch, hershey's gold and hershey's and reese's popped snack mix and chocolate dipped pretzels.
key u.s. marketplace metrics for the full year 2018, our total u.s. retail takeaway, including amplify, increased 0.3% in the expanded multi-outlet combined plus convenience store channels (iri mulo + c-stores), which includes candy, mint, gum, salty snacks, snack bars, meat snacks and grocery items. our u.s. candy, mint and gum ("cmg") consumer takeaway was in line with prior year, resulting in a cmg market share loss of approximately 36 basis points due to the timing of innovation and promotional activity relative to our competitors.
the cmg consumer takeaway and market share information reflect measured channels of distribution accounting for approximately 90% of our u.s. confectionery retail business. these channels of distribution primarily include food, drug, mass merchandisers, and convenience store channels, plus wal-mart stores, inc., partial dollar, club and military channels. these metrics are based on measured market scanned purchases as reported by information resources, incorporated ("iri"), the company's market insights and analytics provider, and provide a means to assess our retail takeaway and market position relative to the overall category.
2018 compared with 2017
cost of sales increased 3.8% in 2018 compared with 2017. the increase was driven by higher sales volume, higher freight and logistics costs and additional plant costs. these drivers were partially offset by an incremental $125.1 million favorable impact from marking-to-market our commodity derivative instruments intended to economically hedge future years' commodity purchases and supply chain productivity, gross margin decreased by 10 basis points in 2018 compared with 2017. the decrease was primarily due to the higher freight and logistics costs, unfavorable product mix, additional plant costs related to new production lines, and incremental trade promotional expense. these factors were partially offset by the favorable year-over-year mark-to-market impact from commodity derivative instruments and supply chain productivity.
2017 compared with 2016
cost of sales decreased 4.9% in 2017 compared with 2016. the reduction was driven by lower commodity costs coupled with an incremental $116.0 million favorable impact from marking-to-market our commodity derivative instruments intended to economically hedge future years' commodity purchases, a $53.0 million decrease in business realignment costs, and supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives. these benefits were offset in part by higher freight and warehousing costs and unfavorable manufacturing variances.
gross margin increased by 340 basis points in 2017 compared with 2016. lower commodity costs coupled with the favorable year-over-year mark-to-market impact from commodity derivative instruments, lower business realignment costs, and supply chain productivity contributed to the improvement in gross margin. however, higher supply chain costs and unfavorable product mix partially offset the increase in gross margin.
selling, marketing and administrative
2018 compared with 2017
selling, marketing and administrative ("sm&a") expenses decreased $10.7 million or 0.6% in 2018. total advertising and related consumer marketing expenses declined 10.9% due mainly to spend optimization and shifts relating to our emerging brands, as well as reductions in agency and production fees. selling, marketing and administrative expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, increased approximately 6.2% in 2018 due to incremental expenses from amplify and pirate brands and higher expenses related to the multi-year implementation of our enterprise resource planning system, which more than offset reductions in our base spending from the margin for growth program.
2017 compared with 2016
sm&a expenses decreased $5.8 million or 0.3% in 2017. advertising and related consumer marketing expense remaining consistent with 2016 levels, as higher spending by the north america segment was offset by reduced spending by the international and other segment. while 2017 sm&a benefited from costs savings and efficiency initiatives, lower business realignment costs, and lower acquisition integration costs, these savings were offset in part by higher costs related to acquisition due diligence activities and the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system.
long-lived and intangible asset impairment charges in 2018, we recorded impairment charges totaling $57.7 million to adjust the long-lived asset values within certain disposal groups, including the sgm and tyrrells businesses, the lotte shanghai foods co., ltd. joint venture and other assets. these charges represent the excess of the disposal groups' carrying values, including the related currency translation adjustment amounts realized or to be realized upon completion of the sales, over the sales values less costs to sell for the respective businesses. the fair values of the disposal groups were supported by the sales prices paid by third-party buyers or estimated sales prices based on marketing of the disposal group, when the sale has not yet been completed. the sales of sgm and tyrrells were both completed in july 2018.
in 2017, in connection with the margin for growth program and our initiative to optimize the manufacturing operations supporting our china business, we tested our china long-lived asset group for impairment. our assessment indicated that the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable, and as a result, the impairment loss was allocated to the asset group's long-lived assets. we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges totaling $106.0 million to write-down distributor relationship and trademark intangible assets that had been recognized in connection with the 2014 sgm acquisition and wrote-down property, plant and equipment by $102.7 million.
in 2016, in connection with the annual impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets, we recognized a trademark impairment charge of $4.2 million, primarily resulting from plans to discontinue a brand sold in india.
the assessment of the valuation of goodwill and other long-lived assets is based on management estimates and assumptions, as discussed in our critical accounting policies included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k. these estimates and assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions.
business realignment activities we are currently pursuing several business realignment activities designed to increase our efficiency and focus our business behind key growth strategies. costs recorded for business realignment activities during 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:

costs associated with business realignment activities are classified in our consolidated statements of income as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
margin for growth program in the first quarter 2017, the company's board of directors ("board") unanimously approved several initiatives under a single program designed to drive continued net sales, operating income and earnings per-share diluted growth over the next several years.  this program is focused on improving global efficiency and effectiveness, optimizing the company's supply chain, streamlining the company's operating model and reducing administrative expenses to generate long-term savings.
we originally estimated that the margin for growth program would result in total pre-tax charges of $375 million to $425 million, to be incurred from 2017 to 2019. the majority of the initiatives relating to the program have been executed, with the final initiatives to be completed over approximately the next nine months. to date, we have incurred pre-tax charges to execute the program totaling $336 million. this includes long-lived asset impairment charges of $209 million related to the operations supporting our china business as noted below, as well as the $16 million incremental impairment charge resulting from the sale of sgm (see note 7). in addition to the impairment charges, we have incurred employee separation costs of $48 million and other business realignment costs of $63 million. we expect the remaining spending on this program to be minimal in 2019, bringing total estimated project costs to approximately $340 million to $355 million. the cash portion of the total program charges is estimated to be $97 million to $110 million. the company reduced its global workforce by approximately 15% as a result of this program, with a majority of the reductions coming from hourly headcount positions outside of the united states.
during 2018, we recognized total costs associated with the margin for growth program of $55 million. these charges included employee severance, largely relating to initiatives to improve the cost structure of our china business and to further streamline our corporate operating model, as well as non-cash, asset-related incremental depreciation expense as part of optimizing the global supply chain. in addition, we incurred other program costs, which relate primarily to third-party charges in support of our initiative to improve global efficiency and effectiveness. during 2017, we recognized total costs associated with the margin for growth program of $56 million. the 2017 charges are consistent in nature to the 2018 activity.
the program included an initiative to optimize the manufacturing operations supporting our china business.  when the program was approved in 2017, we deemed this to be a triggering event requiring us to test our china long-lived asset group for impairment by first determining whether the carrying value of the asset group was recovered by our current estimates of future cash flows associated with the asset group. because this assessment indicated that the carrying value was not recoverable, we calculated an impairment loss as the excess of the asset group's carrying value over its fair value. the resulting impairment loss was allocated to the asset group's long-lived assets. therefore, as a result of this testing, during the first quarter of 2017, we recorded impairment charges totaling $209 million, with $106 million representing the portion of the impairment loss that was allocated to the distributor relationship and trademark intangible assets that had been recognized in connection with the 2014 sgm acquisition and $103 million representing the portion of the impairment loss that was allocated to property, plant and equipment. these impairment charges are recorded in the long-lived asset impairment charges caption within the consolidated statements of operations.
operational optimization program in the second quarter of 2016, we commenced a program (the "operational optimization program") to optimize our production and supply chain network, which included select facility consolidations. the program encompassed the transition of our china chocolate and sgm operations into a united golden hershey platform, including the integration of the china sales force, as well as workforce planning efforts and the consolidation of production within certain facilities in china and north america.
during 2018, we incurred pre-tax costs totaling $3 million, relating primarily to third-party charges in support of our initiative to optimize our production and supply chain network. in addition, we completed the sale of select china facilities in 2018 that had been taken out of service in connection with the operational optimization program resulting in a gain of $7 million. during 2017 and 2016, we incurred pre-tax costs totaling $14 million and $88 million respectively, including non-cash asset-related incremental depreciation costs in 2016, employee related costs, costs to consolidate and relocate production, and third party costs incurred to execute these activities. this program was completed in 2018.
2015 productivity initiative in mid-2015, we initiated a productivity initiative (the "2015 productivity initiative") intended to move decision making closer to the customer and the consumer, to enable a more enterprise-wide approach to innovation, to more swiftly advance our knowledge agenda, and to provide for a more efficient cost structure, while ensuring that we effectively allocate resources to future growth areas. overall, the 2015 productivity initiative was undertaken to simplify the organizational structure to enhance the company's ability to rapidly anticipate and respond to the changing demands of the global consumer.
the 2015 productivity initiative was executed throughout the third and fourth quarters of 2015, resulting in a net reduction of approximately 300 positions, with the majority of the departures taking place by the end of 2015. the 2015 productivity initiative was completed during the third quarter 2016. final costs incurred in 2016 relating to this program totaled $5,609.
operating profit and operating profit margin
2018 compared with 2017
operating profit increased 23.6% in 2018 compared with 2017 due primarily to higher gross profit, lower impairment charges and business realignment costs, and lower sm&a in the 2018 period. operating profit margin increased to 20.8% in 2018 from 17.5% in 2017 driven by these same factors.
2017 compared with 2016
operating profit increased 4.6% in 2017 compared with 2016 due primarily to higher gross profit and slightly lower sm&a expenses, as discussed previously. operating profit margin increased to 17.5% in 2017 from 16.9% in 2016 driven by the improvement in gross margin.
2018 compared with 2017
net interest expense was $40.6 million higher in 2018 than in 2017. the increase was due to higher levels of commercial paper issued to fund the amplify acquisition and higher interest rates on our short-term debt, as well as incremental interest on $1.2 billion of notes issued in may 2018.
2017 compared with 2016
net interest expense was $8.1 million higher in 2017 than in 2016. the increase was due to higher levels of long-term debt outstanding and higher interest rates on commercial paper during the 2017 period, as well as a decreased benefit from the fixed to floating swaps.
2018 compared with 2017
other (income) expense, net totaled expense of $74.8 million in 2018 versus expense of $104.4 million 2017. the decrease in the net expense was primarily due to lower non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost relating to pension and other post-retirement benefit plans during 2018, as well as lower write-downs on equity investments qualifying for federal historic and energy tax credits.
2017 compared with 2016
other (income) expense, net totaled expense of $104.4 million in 2017 versus expense of $65.6 million in 2016. in 2017 we recognized a $66.2 million write-down on equity investments qualifying for federal historic and energy tax credits, compared to a $43.5 million write down in 2016. in 2017, the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost relating to pension and other post-retirement benefit plans totaled $38.8 million compared to $49.4 million in 2016. additionally, 2016 was offset by an extinguishment gain of $26.7 million related to the settlement of the sgm liability.
2018 compared with 2017
our effective income tax rate was 17.0% for 2018 compared with 31.9% for 2017. relative to the 21% statutory rate, the 2018 effective tax rate was impacted by a favorable foreign rate differential and investment tax credits, which were partially offset by the impact of state taxes.  the 2017 effective rate, relative to the previous statutory rate of 35%, benefited from a favorable foreign rate differential, investment tax credits and the benefit of asu 2016-09 for the accounting of employee share-based payments, which were partially offset by the impact of u.s. tax reform and non-benefited costs resulting from the margin for growth program.
2017 compared with 2016
our effective income tax rate was 31.9% for 2017 compared with 34.5% for 2016. relative to the statutory rate, the 2017 effective tax rate was impacted by a favorable foreign rate differential relating to foreign operations and cocoa procurement, investment tax credits and the benefit of asu 2016-09 for the accounting of employee share-based payments, which were partially offset by the impact of u.s. tax reform and non-benefited costs resulting from the margin for growth program.  the 2016 effective rate benefited from the impact of non-taxable income related to the settlement of the sgm liability and investment tax credits.
2018 compared with 2017
net income increased $394.6 million, or 50.4%, while eps-diluted increased $1.92, or 52.5%, in 2018 compared with 2017. the increase in both net income and eps-diluted was driven primarily by 2018 higher gross profit, lower impairment charges and business realignment costs, lower sm&a, and lower income taxes, which were partly offset by higher interest expense, as noted above. our 2018 eps-diluted also benefited from lower weighted-average shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases, including both current year and prior year repurchases from the milton hershey school trust (the "trust"), as well as current year repurchases pursuant to our board-approved repurchase programs.
2017 compared with 2016
net income increased $62.9 million, or 8.7%, while eps-diluted increased $0.32, or 9.6%, in 2017 compared with 2016. the increase in both net income and eps-diluted were driven by higher gross profit, lower sm&a and lower income taxes, partly offset by the long-lived asset impairment charges and higher write-downs relating to tax credit investments, as noted above. our 2017 eps-diluted also benefited from lower weighted-average shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases, including a current year repurchase from the trust and prior year repurchases pursuant to our board-approved repurchase programs.
segment results the summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our two reportable segments: north america and international and other. the segments reflect our operations on a geographic basis. for segment reporting purposes, we use "segment income" to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. segment income excludes unallocated general corporate administrative expenses, unallocated mark-to-market gains and losses on commodity derivatives, business realignment and impairment charges, acquisition-related costs and other unusual gains or losses that are not part of our measurement of segment performance. these items of our operating income are largely managed centrally at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment income reviewed by the codm and used for resource allocation and internal management reporting and performance evaluation. segment income and segment income margin, which are presented in the segment discussion that follows, are non-gaap measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance. we believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors, as they exclude the activities that are not directly attributable to our ongoing segment operations. for further information, see the non-gaap information section of this md&a.

north america the north america segment is responsible for our chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery market position, as well as our grocery and growing snacks market positions, in the united states and canada. this includes developing and growing our business in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery, pantry, food service and other snacking product lines. north america accounted for 88.6%, 88.1% and 87.8% of our net sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. north america results for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:
percent change for the years ended december 31,                  2018                  2017                  2016          2018 vs 2017           2017 vs 2016
2018 compared with 2017
net sales of our north america segment increased $280.4 million or 4.2% in 2018 compared to 2017, which includes a 4.6% benefit from the amplify and pirate brands acquisitions. excluding the amplify and pirate brands acquisitions, our north america segment net sales decreased 0.4%. net price realization declined 1.3% due to incremental trade promotional expense in support of 2018 programming, partially offset by volume increases of 0.9% due to innovation, specifically driven by reese's outrageous bars and hershey's gold.
our north america segment income decreased $24.1 million or 1.2% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to higher trade promotional expense, higher logistics costs, unfavorable sales mix and additional plant costs, as well as incremental sm&a expense, including amortization expense, from the amplify and pirate brands acquisitions. these higher expenses more than offset reductions in advertising and related consumer marketing expense, which declined 11.2% versus the 2017 period, with the reduction driven by spend optimization and shifts relating to our emerging brands, as advertising and related consumer marketing on our core u.s. brands increased during the year.
2017 compared with 2016
net sales of our north america segment increased $88.2 million or 1.3% in 2017 compared to 2016, driven by increased volume of 0.5% due to a longer easter season, as well as 2017 innovation, specifically, hershey's cookie layer crunch, and the launch of hershey's gold and hershey's and reese's popped snack mix and chocolate dipped pretzels. additionally, the barkthins brand acquisition contributed 0.3%. net price realization increased by 0.4% due to decreased levels of trade promotional spending. excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of 0.1%, the net sales of our north america segment increased by approximately 1.2%.
our north america segment income increased $3.7 million or 0.2% in 2017 compared to 2016, driven by higher gross profit, partially offset by investments in greater levels of advertising expense and go-to-market capabilities, as well as unfavorable manufacturing variances and higher freight and warehousing costs.
international and other the international and other segment includes all other countries where we currently manufacture, import, market, sell or distribute chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery and other products. currently, this includes our operations in china and other asia markets, latin america, europe, africa and the middle east, along with exports to these regions. while a less significant component, this segment also includes our global retail operations, including hershey's chocolate world stores in hershey, pennsylvania, new york city, las vegas, niagara falls (ontario) and singapore, as well as operations associated with licensing the use of certain trademarks and products to third parties around the world. international and other accounted for 11.4%, 11.9% and 12.2% of our net sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. international and other results for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:
percent change for the years ended december 31,                2018                2017                 2016   2018 vs 2017           2017 vs 2016
2018 compared with 2017
net sales of our international and other segment decreased $4.8 million or 0.5% in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting a 4.4% reduction in net sales from the divestiture of sgm and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 1.8%, partially offset by volume increases of 4.7% and favorable price realization of 1.0%. excluding the sale of sgm and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, our international and other segment net sales increased 5.7%.
the volume increase was primarily attributed to solid marketplace growth in india, brazil and mexico, where constant currency net sales increased by 26.3%, 8.4%, and 6.2%, respectively. the favorable net price realization was driven by decreased levels of trade promotional spending compared to the prior year.
our international and other segment generated income of $73.8 million in 2018 compared to $11.5 million in 2017, with the improvement primarily resulting from our efforts to drive sustainable gross margin improvements as we executed our margin for growth program and optimize the product portfolio across various international markets. additionally, segment income benefited from continued growth across mexico, brazil, india and regional markets.
2017 compared with 2016
net sales of our international and other segment decreased $12.9 million or 1.4% in 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting volume declines of 4.7%, partially offset by favorable price realization of 2.7% and a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 0.6%. excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, the net sales of our international and other segment decreased by approximately 2.0%.
the volume decrease is primarily attributed to our china business, driven by softness in the modern trade channel coupled with a focus on optimizing our product offerings. the favorable net price realization was driven by higher prices in select markets, as well as reduced levels of trade promotional spending, which declined significantly compared to the prior year. constant currency net sales in mexico and brazil increased by 10.8% and 10.5%, respectively, driven by solid chocolate marketplace performance. india also experienced constant currency net sales growth of 13.8%.
our international and other segment generated income of $11.5 million in 2017 compared to a loss of $29.1 million in 2016 due to benefits from reduced trade promotional spending and lower operating expenses in china as a result of our margin for growth program. additionally, segment income benefited from the improved combined income in latin america and export markets versus the prior year.
unallocated corporate expense unallocated corporate expense includes centrally-managed (a) corporate functional costs relating to legal, treasury, finance and human resources, (b) expenses associated with the oversight and administration of our global operations, including warehousing, distribution and manufacturing, information systems and global shared services, (c) non-cash stock-based compensation expense and (d) other gains or losses that are not integral to segment performance.
unallocated corporate expense totaled $486.8 million in 2018 as compared to $499.2 million in 2017 primarily driven by savings from our productivity and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by spending on the multi-year implementation of our enterprise resource planning system. in 2017, unallocated corporate expense increased $10.9 million from $488.3 million in 2016. while we realized savings in 2017 from our productivity and cost savings initiatives, these savings were more than offset by higher costs related to the multi-year implementation of our enterprise resource planning system, as well as higher due diligence costs related to merger and acquisition activity.
financial condition we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. significant factors affecting liquidity include cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, repurchases of outstanding shares, the adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. we generate substantial cash from operations and remain in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for capital reinvestment, strategic acquisitions and the payment of dividends.

operating activities our principal source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. our net income and, consequently, our cash provided by operations are impacted by sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, timing of new product introductions, profit margins and price changes. sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. generally, working capital needs peak during the summer months. we meet these needs primarily with cash on hand, bank borrowings or the issuance of commercial paper.
cash provided by operating activities in 2018 increased $350.4 million relative to 2017. this increase was driven by the following factors:
•   net income adjusted for non-cash charges to operations (including depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, goodwill, indefinite and long-lived asset charges, write-down of equity investments and other charges) contributed $257 million of additional cash flow in 2018 relative to 2017.
•   incomes taxes generated cash of $76 million in 2018, compared to a use of cash of $71 million in 2017. this $147 million fluctuation was mainly due to the variance in actual tax expense for 2018 relative to the timing of quarterly estimated tax payments, which resulted in a higher taxes payable position at the end of 2018 compared to 2017.
•   the increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by the following net cash outflows:
◦   prepaid expenses and other current assets used cash of $40 million in 2018, compared to cash generated of $18 million in 2017. this $58 million fluctuation was mainly driven by the timing of payments on commodity futures. in addition, in 2018, the volume of commodity futures held, which require margin deposits, was higher compared to 2017. we utilize commodity futures contracts to economically manage the risk of future price fluctuations associated with our purchase of raw materials.
cash provided by operating activities in 2017 increased $236.1 million relative to 2016. this increase was driven by the following factors:
•   net income adjusted for non-cash charges to operations (including depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, goodwill, indefinite and long-lived asset charges, write-down of equity investments, the gain on settlement of the sgm liability and other charges) contributed $329 million of additional cash flow in 2017 relative to 2016.
•   prepaid expenses and other current assets generated cash of $18 million in 2017, compared to a use of cash of $43 million in 2016. this $61 million fluctuation was mainly driven by the timing of payments on commodity futures. in addition, in 2017, the volume of commodity futures held, which require margin deposits, was lower compared to 2016. we utilize commodity futures contracts to economically manage the risk of future price fluctuations associated with our purchase of raw materials.
•   the increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by the following net cash outflows:
◦   working capital (comprised of trade accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued liabilities) consumed cash of $131 million in 2017 and $28 million in 2016. this $103 million fluctuation was mainly due to a higher year-over-year build up of u.s. inventories to satisfy product requirements and maintain sufficient levels to accommodate customer requirements, coupled with a higher investment in inventory in mexico and india, driven by volume growth in those markets.
◦   the use of cash for income taxes increased $70 million, mainly due to the variance in actual tax expense for 2017 relative to the timing of quarterly estimated tax payments, which resulted in a higher prepaid tax position at the end of 2017 compared to 2016.
pension and post-retirement activity. we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $42.1 million, $59.7 million and $72.8 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, relating to our benefit plans (including our defined benefit and other post retirement plans). the main drivers of fluctuations in expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our long-term estimates, including discount rates used to value plan obligations, expected returns on plan assets, the service and interest costs and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses.
the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates and the level of funding. we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements. cash contributions to our pension and post retirement plans totaled $25.9 million, $56.4 million and $41.7 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
investing activities our principal uses of cash for investment purposes relate to purchases of property, plant and equipment and capitalized software, as well as acquisitions of businesses, partially offset by proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment. we used cash of $1,502.9 million for investing activities in 2018 compared to $328.6 million in 2017, with the increase driven by two business acquisitions in 2018 compared to no business acquisition activity in 2017. we used cash of $595.4 million for investing activities in 2016, with the increases versus 2017 primarily driven by a business acquisition in 2016.
primary investing activities include the following:
•   capital spending. capital expenditures, including capitalized software, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost savings, were $328.6 million in 2018, $257.7 million in 2017 and $269.5 million in 2016. our 2018 expenditures were higher compared to 2017 and 2016 as a result of increased u.s. core chocolate brand capacity expansion and investments in our enterprise resource planning system implementation. we expect 2019 capital expenditures, including capitalized software, to approximate $330 million to $350 million.
•   proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets. during 2018, we generated $49.8 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets. this included sales of select china facilities that were taken out of operation in connection with the operational optimization program. proceeds from the sale of these facilities totaled $27.5 million, resulting in a gain of $6.6 million. additionally, we sold licensing rights for a non-core trademark relating to a brand marketed outside of the u.s. for $13.0 million, resulting in a gain of $2.7 million.
•   proceeds from the sales of businesses. in july 2018, we sold the tyrrells and sgm businesses. collectively, the proceeds from the sales of these businesses, net of cash divested, totaled approximately $167.0 million. we had no divestiture activity in the comparable 2017 or 2016 periods.
•   business acquisitions. in 2018, we spent $915 million to acquire amplify and $423 million to acquire pirate brands. we had no acquisition activity in 2017. in 2016, we spent $285.4 million to acquire ripple brand collective, llc.
•   investments in partnerships qualifying for tax credits. we make investments in partnership entities that in turn make equity investments in projects eligible to receive federal historic and energy tax credits. we invested approximately $52.6 million in 2018, $78.6 million in 2017 and $44.3 million in 2016 in projects qualifying for tax credits.
financing activities our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends, offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. financing activities in 2018 increased cash by $116.1 million, compared to cash used of $843.8 million in 2017. we used cash of $464.4 million for financing activities in 2016, primarily to fund dividend payments and share repurchases, partially offset by incremental borrowings.
the majority of our financing activity was attributed to the following:
•   short-term borrowings, net. in addition to utilizing cash on hand, we use short-term borrowings (commercial paper and bank borrowings) to fund seasonal working capital requirements and ongoing business needs. in 2018, we generated cash flow of $645.8 million through the issuance of short-term commercial paper, partially offset by a reduction in short-term foreign bank borrowings. we utilized the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper to fund the amplify acquisition and repay amplify's outstanding debt owed under its existing credit agreement. a portion of the commercial paper borrowings used to fund the amplify acquisition were subsequently refinanced with the proceeds of new notes issued during the second quarter of 2018, as discussed below. in 2017, we used $81.4 million to reduce commercial paper borrowings and short-term foreign borrowings. in 2016, we generated cash flow of $275.6 million through short-term commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by payments in short-term foreign borrowings.
•   long-term debt borrowings and repayments. in 2018, we issued $350 million of 2.90% notes due in 2020, $350 million of 3.10% notes due in 2021 and $500 million of 3.375% notes due in 2023. proceeds from the issuance of the notes, net of discounts and issuance costs, totaled $1,193.8 million. in 2018, we repaid $300 million of 1.60% notes due in 2018 upon their maturity. additionally, in 2018, we repaid a portion of the commercial paper borrowings that had been used to fund the amplify acquisition. in 2017, we had minimal incremental long-term borrowings and no repayment activity. in 2016, we used $500 million to repay long-term debt. additionally, in 2016, we issued $500 million of 2.30% notes due in 2026 and $300 million of 3.375% notes due in 2046.
•   tax receivable obligation. in connection with the amplify acquisition, the company agreed to make payments to the counterparty of a tax receivable agreement. in 2018, we paid $72.0 million to settle the tax receivable obligation.
•   share repurchases. we repurchase shares of common stock to offset the dilutive impact of treasury shares issued under our equity compensation plans. the value of these share repurchases in a given period varies based on the volume of stock options exercised and our market price. in addition, we periodically repurchase shares of common stock pursuant to board-authorized programs intended to drive additional stockholder value. we used cash for total share repurchases of $247.5 million in 2018, which included a privately negotiated repurchase transaction with hershey trust company, as trustee for the trust, to purchase 450 thousand shares for $47.8 million. we used cash for total share repurchases of $300.3 million in 2017, which included a privately negotiated repurchase transaction with hershey trust company, as trustee for the trust, to purchase 1.5 million shares for $159.0 million. we used cash for total share repurchases of $592.6 million in 2016, which included purchases pursuant to authorized programs of $420.2 million to purchase 4.6 million shares. as of december 31, 2018, approximately $60 million remained available under the $100 million share repurchase authorization approved by the board in october 2017. in july 2018, our board approved an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization, which is to commence after the existing 2017 authorization is completed and is to be utilized at management's discretion.
•   proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including tax benefits. we received $63.3 million from employee exercises of stock options, net of employee taxes withheld from share-based awards in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $94.8 million in 2016. variances are driven primarily by the number of shares exercised and the share price at the date of grant.
liquidity and capital resources at december 31, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $588.0 million. at december 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $380.2 million. our cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2018 increased $207.8 million compared to the 2017 year-end balance as a result of the sources of net cash outlined in the previous discussion.
approximately 75% of the balance of our cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2018 was held by subsidiaries domiciled outside of the united states. the company recognized the one-time u.s. repatriation tax due under u.s. tax reform and, as a result, repatriation of these amounts would not be subject to additional u.s. federal income tax but would be subject to applicable withholding taxes in the relevant jurisdiction. our intent is to reinvest funds earned outside of the united states to finance foreign operations and investments, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our u.s. operations. we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs, including our cash needs in the united states.
we maintain debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders' equity. our total debt was $4.5 billion at december 31, 2018 and $2.9 billion at december 31, 2017. our total debt increased in 2018 mainly due to the additional notes issued mid-year, which were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper borrowings that had been used to fund the amplify acquisition and repay amplify's outstanding debt owed under its existing credit agreement.
as a source of short-term financing, we maintain a $1.4 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. as of december 31, 2018, the termination date of this agreement is november 2020. we may use these funds for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions. as of december 31, 2018, we had $315 million of available capacity under the agreement. the unsecured revolving credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants, customary representations, warranties and events of default. we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31, 2018.
in addition to the revolving credit facility, we maintain lines of credit in various currencies with domestic and international commercial banks. as of december 31, 2018, we had available capacity of $273 million under these lines of credit.
furthermore, we have a current shelf registration statement filed with the sec that allows for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities. proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the current registration statement may be used for general corporate requirements, including reducing existing borrowings, financing capital additions and funding contributions to our pension plans, future business acquisitions and working capital requirements.
our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk-based interest rates is partly a function of our existing cash-flow-to-debt and debt-to-capitalization levels as well as our current credit standing.
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt. operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures.
equity structure we have two classes of stock outstanding - common stock and class b stock. holders of the common stock and the class b stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders, including the election of directors. holders of the common stock have 1 vote per share. holders of the class b stock have 10 votes per share. holders of the common stock, voting separately as a class, are entitled to elect one-sixth of our board. with respect to dividend rights, holders of the common stock are entitled to cash dividends 10% higher than those declared and paid on the class b stock.
hershey trust company, as trustee for the trust established by milton s. and catherine s. hershey that has as its sole beneficiary milton hershey school, maintains voting control over the hershey company. in addition, three representatives of hershey trust company currently serve as members of the company's board. in performing their responsibilities on the company's board, these representatives may from time to time exercise influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board or management. hershey trust company, as trustee for the trust, in its role as controlling stockholder of the company, has indicated it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company. the company's board, and not the hershey trust company board, is solely responsible and accountable for the company's management and performance.
pennsylvania law requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in hershey trust company, as trustee for the trust, no longer having voting control of the company. the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over hershey trust company, as trustee for the trust, to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations. this legislation makes it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby may delay or prevent a change in control of the company.
guarantees and other off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.

(4) represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. our policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the minimum and maximum limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 ("erisa"), federal income tax laws and the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006. we fund non-domestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans. for more information, see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
(5) purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for the purchase of raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business. amounts presented included fixed price forward contracts and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december 31, 2018. the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities at year-end 2018, nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans, but are not obligated to incur. such amounts are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. we do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.
in entering into contractual obligations, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution, conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties. our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates. we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults.
asset retirement obligations we have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities. our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations, which require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a specified manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished. we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities. we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and, therefore, sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique. we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of significant quantities of asbestos.
income tax obligations liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of these potential liabilities. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
recent accounting pronouncements information on recently adopted and issued accounting standards is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates and assumptions. we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following:
l   accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities l   pension and other post-retirement benefits plans l   goodwill and other intangible assets l   income taxes management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board. while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. other significant accounting policies are outlined in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities we promote our products with advertising, trade promotions and consumer incentives. these programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives. we expense advertising costs and other direct marketing expenses as incurred. we recognize the costs of trade promotion and consumer incentive activities as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition. these estimates are based on our analysis of the programs offered, historical trends, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, sales and payment trends and our experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past. the estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in future periods due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation, particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products. differences between estimated expense and actual program performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period and are normally not significant. during 2018, 2017, and 2016, actual annual promotional costs have not deviated from the estimated amount by more than 3%. our trade promotion and consumer incentive accrued liabilities totaled $171.4 million and $173.7 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
pension and other post-retirement benefits plans we sponsor various defined benefit pension plans. the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees, which are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most u.s. employees hired prior to january 1, 2007. we also sponsor two primary other post-employment benefit ("opeb") plans, consisting of a health care plan and life insurance plan for retirees. the health care plan is contributory, with participants' contributions adjusted annually, and the life insurance plan is non-contributory.
for accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. our related accounting policies, accounting balances and plan assumptions are discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
pension plans changes in certain assumptions could significantly affect pension expense and benefit obligations, particularly the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate such obligations:
•   long-term rate of return on plan assets. the expected long-term rate of return is evaluated on an annual basis. we consider a number of factors when setting assumptions with respect to the long-term rate of return, including current and expected asset allocation and historical and expected returns on the plan asset categories. actual asset allocations are regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate. investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return estimated using the long-term rate of return and the actual return realized. for 2019, we increased the expected return on plan assets assumption to 6.0% from the 5.8% assumption used during 2018. the historical average return (compounded annually) over the 20 years prior to december 31, 2018 was approximately 6.0%.
as of december 31, 2018, our primary plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately $348 million. we amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor amount, which is the greater of 10% of a respective plan's projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of plan assets. these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the expected long-term rate of investment returns, (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations or (iii) other actuarial gains when actual plan experience is favorable as compared to the assumed experience. a 100 basis point decrease or increase in the long-term rate of return on pension assets would correspondingly increase or decrease annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately $10 million.
•   discount rate. prior to december 31, 2017, the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost were determined utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. beginning in 2018, we elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. we made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates along the yield curve. this change does not affect the measurement of our pension and other post-retirement benefit liabilities but generally results in lower benefit expense in periods when the yield curve is upward sloping, which was the case in 2018. we accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, accounted for it on a prospective basis starting in 2018.
a 100 basis point decrease (increase) in the weighted-average pension discount rate would increase (decrease) annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately $5 million and the december 31, 2018 pension liability would increase by approximately $87 million or decrease by approximately $75 million, respectively.
pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is expected to be approximately $30 million in 2019. pension expense beyond 2019 will depend on future investment performance, our contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans.
other post-employment benefit plans changes in significant assumptions could affect consolidated expense and benefit obligations, particularly the discount rates used to calculate such obligations and the healthcare cost trend rate:
•   discount rate. the determination of the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligations of the opeb plans is discussed in the pension plans section above. a 100 basis point decrease (increase) in the discount rate assumption for these plans would not be material to the opeb plans' consolidated expense and the december 31, 2018 benefit liability would increase by approximately $22 million or decrease by approximately $19 million, respectively.
•   healthcare cost trend rate. the healthcare cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including our recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the healthcare marketplace, as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the effects of a one percentage point change in the healthcare cost trend rate.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present. our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
we test goodwill for impairment by performing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors in assessing the fair value of the related reporting unit. if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. otherwise, no further testing is required. for those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is indicated, requiring recognition of a goodwill impairment charge for the differential (up to the carrying value of goodwill). we test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair values with the book values of each asset.
we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets using an income approach. under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value. our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance, current and anticipated market conditions and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and profitability, and cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending. additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates, estimated discount rates, which may be risk-adjusted for the operating market of the reporting unit, and estimated royalty rates that would be charged for comparable branded licenses. we believe such assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar valuation purposes. such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions.
we also have intangible assets, consisting primarily of certain trademarks, customer-related intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions, that are expected to have determinable useful lives. the costs of finite-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. our estimates of the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets consider judgments regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. we conduct impairment tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these finite-lived assets may not be recoverable. undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists. if an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on the estimated fair value of the assets.
at december 31, 2018, the net book value of our goodwill totaled $1,801.1 million and related to four reporting units. based on our most recent quantitative testing, all of our reporting units had a percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of 100% or more. therefore, as it relates to our 2018 annual testing performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter, we tested all four reporting units using a qualitative assessment and determined that no quantitative testing was deemed necessary. there were no other events or circumstances that would indicate that impairment may exist.
in february 2017, we commenced the margin for growth program which includes an initiative to optimize the manufacturing operations supporting our china business.  we deemed this to be a triggering event requiring us to test our china long-lived asset group for impairment by first determining whether the carrying value of the asset group was recovered by our current estimates of future cash flows associated with the asset group. because this assessment indicated that the carrying value was not recoverable, we calculated an impairment loss as the excess of the asset group's carrying value over its fair value. the resulting impairment loss was allocated to the asset group's long-lived assets. therefore, as a result of this testing, during the first quarter of 2017, we recorded an impairment charge totaling $105.9 million representing the portion of the impairment loss that was allocated to the distributor relationship and trademark intangible assets that had been recognized in connection with the 2014 sgm acquisition.
in 2016, in connection with our annual impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets, we recognized a trademark impairment charge of $4.2 million, primarily resulting from plans to discontinue a brand sold in india.
income taxes we base our deferred income taxes, accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income, statutory tax rates, the legal structure of our company, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. we file income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, but a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which we have unrecognized tax benefits, is audited and finally resolved. from time to time, these audits result in assessments of additional tax. we maintain reserves for such assessments.
we apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. future changes in judgments and estimates related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such change. while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most likely outcome. accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense. we adjust these unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established. settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash. favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. our valuation allowances are primarily related to u.s. capital loss carryforwards and various foreign jurisdictions' net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets for which we do not expect to realize a benefit.

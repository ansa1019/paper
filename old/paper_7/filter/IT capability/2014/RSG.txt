during each of the three years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded a number of charges and other expenses and benefits that impacted our pre-tax income, net income attributable to republic services, inc. (net income - republic) and diluted earnings per share as noted in the following table (in millions, except per share data). additionally, see our "cost of operations," "selling, general and administrative expenses" and "income taxes" discussions contained in the results of operations section of this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of other items that impacted our earnings.

(1) the aggregate impact of these items noted to adjusted diluted earnings per share totals to $0.01 for the year ended december 31, 2014.
we believe that presenting adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income attributable to republic services, inc., and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are not measures determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (u.s. gaap), provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. we use these measures, and believe investors will find them helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. we have incurred comparable charges and costs in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. in the case of the bridgeton remediation charges, we are adjusting such amounts due to their significant effect on our operating results; however, in the ordinary course of our business, we often incur remediation adjustments that we do not adjust from our operating results. our definition of adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income attributable to republic services inc., and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
negotiation and withdrawal costs - central states pension and other funds. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded charges to earnings of $1.5 million, primarily related to costs associated with our 2013 withdrawal from the central states, southeast and southwest areas pension fund (the fund). during the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, we recorded charges to earnings of $157.7 million and $35.8 million, respectively, primarily related to our negotiation and withdrawal liability from the fund.
restructuring charges. during the fourth quarter of 2012, we announced a restructuring of our field and corporate operations to create a more efficient and competitive company. these changes included consolidating our field regions from four to three and our areas from 28 to 20, relocating office space, and reducing administrative staffing levels. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we incurred costs of $1.8 million due to a change in estimate of amounts recoverable from sublet income associated with abandoned office space with non-cancellable lease terms. during the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, we incurred $8.6 million and $11.1 million, respectively, of restructuring charges, which consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits, relocation benefits, and the closure of offices with lease agreements with non-cancelable terms.
loss on extinguishment of debt. we refinanced our credit facilities and certain of our tax-exempt financings in 2014, resulting in non-cash charges for deferred issuance costs of $1.4 million. during the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, we completed various refinancing transactions that resulted in cash paid for premiums and professional fees to repurchase outstanding debt, as well as non-cash charges for unamortized debt discounts and deferred issuance costs. for a more detailed discussion of the components of these costs and the debt series to which they relate, see our "loss on extinguishment of debt" discussion contained in the results of operations section of this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
bridgeton remediation and other. during 2014, we updated our cost and timeline estimates to build and operate a leachate management facility and related infrastructure, manage the remediation area and monitor the site. accordingly, we recorded environmental remediation charges of $210.6 million. additionally, we recorded certain remediation charges for the superfund site and ongoing litigation costs. during the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, we recorded environmental remediation charges in the amount of $108.7 million and $74.1 million, respectively, to manage the remediation area and monitor the site.
tax valuation allowance adjustment. during the fourth quarter of 2013, we reduced our valuation allowance related to certain deferred tax assets for state net operating loss carryforwards due to our determination that it is more likely than not that a portion of these carryforwards would be utilized in future years.
loss (gain) on disposition of assets and impairments, net. during 2014, we recorded a charge to earnings of $20.0 million primarily related to costs associated with one of our divested landfills, of which $14.1 million relates to closure and post-closure costs and $5.9 million relates to remediation expenditures. during each of the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, we recorded a net gain on disposition of assets of and impairments related to certain divestitures. for a more detailed discussion of the components of this, see our "loss (gain) on disposition of assets and impairments, net" discussion contained in the results of operations section of this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
recent developments in february 2015, we acquired all the equity of tervita, llc (tervita) in exchange for a cash payment of approximately $485 million. tervita is an environmental solutions provider serving oil and natural gas producers in the united states. tervita provides oilfield waste services to its diverse customer base and operates three types of waste management and disposal facilities: treatment, recovery and disposal facilities; engineered landfills; and salt water disposal injection wells. additionally, tervita provides closed loop solids control systems and transportation services. while we have available cash on hand and capacity under our credit facilities, we are evaluating opportunities to finance the acquisition on a longer term basis.
2015 guidance in 2015, we will continue to focus on managing the controllable aspects of our business by enhancing the quality of our revenue, investing in profitable growth opportunities, and reducing costs. our team remains focused on executing our strategy to deliver consistent earnings and free cash flow growth, and improve return on invested capital. we are committed to an efficient capital structure, maintaining our investment grade credit ratings, and increasing cash returns to our shareholders.
our guidance is based on current economic conditions and does not assume any significant changes in the overall economy in 2015. the guidance includes the expected financial impact from the acquisition of tervita, llc in february 2015. specific guidance follows:
recycled commodities       (0.5) to (1.0)
solid waste acquisitions              1.5
e&amp;p acquisition                   1.5
•   approximately 20% of the revenue has price changes based on a cost plus a specific profit margin or other measurement.
the consumer price index varies from a single historical stated period of time or an average of trailing historical rates over a stated period of time. in addition, the initial impact of pricing resets typically lags 6 to 12 months from the end of the index measurement period to the date the revised pricing goes into effect. as a result, current changes in a specific index may not manifest themselves in our reported pricing for several quarters into the future.
facilities and other                                                125
results of operations revenue we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations. our remaining revenue is from other services, including transfer station services, landfill disposal and recycling. our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on long-term contracts with municipalities. certain of our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as the consumer price index. we generally provide commercial and industrial collection services to customers under contracts with terms up to three years. our transfer stations, landfills and, to a lesser extent, our recycling facilities generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties. in general, we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recycled commodities. other non-core revenue consists primarily of revenue from national accounts, which represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators. consequently, substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations.
sale of recycled commodities         390.8           4.4                 374.6           4.5                 349.0           4.3

•   average yield increased revenue by 1.4% due to positive pricing in all lines of business.
•   the fuel recovery fee program, which mitigates our exposure to increases in fuel prices, generated 0.1% of the total revenue growth. these fees fluctuate with the price of fuel and, consequently, any increase in fuel prices would result in an increase in our revenue. higher fuel recovery fees for 2014 resulted primarily from an increase in the fuel recovery rates charged. during 2014, we were able to recover approximately 78% of our direct fuel expenses with fuel recovery fees, compared to approximately 74% during 2013.
•   volume increased revenue by 2.0%, primarily due to volume increases in our industrial and commercial collection and landfill lines of business due to improving business activity and new national accounts contracts, partially offset by declines in our residential collection line and our transfer station lines of business. volume increases in our landfill line of business were primarily attributable to increased special waste volumes.
•   recycled commodities increased revenue by 0.1%, primarily due to the mix of materials and increased production volumes, offset by lower commodity prices. the average price for old corrugated cardboard for 2014 was $116 per ton compared to $128 per ton for 2013. the average price of old newspaper for 2014 was $89 per ton compared to
$93 per ton for 2013. our recycled commodity volume for 2014 of 2.3 million tons sold was approximately 4% higher than the volume in 2013 as a result of our continued investment in recycling centers along with increases in brokering of recycled commodity volumes on behalf of our national accounts customers.
changing market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices. at current volumes and mix of materials, we believe a $10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately $28 million and $16 million, respectively.
•   average yield increased revenue by 1.3% due to positive pricing in all lines of business.
•   the fuel recovery fee program generated 0.3% of the total revenue growth. higher fuel recovery fees for 2013 as compared to 2012 resulted primarily from an increase in the fuel recovery rates charged. during 2013, we were able to recover approximately 74% of our direct fuel expenses with fuel recovery fees, compared to 67% during 2012.
•   recycled commodities increased revenue by 0.3%, primarily due to the change in the market price of materials as well as increased production volumes. the average price for old corrugated cardboard was $128 per ton for 2013 compared to $124 per ton for 2012. the average price of old newspaper was $93 per ton for 2013 compared to $105 per ton for 2012. our recycled commodity volume for 2013 of 2.2 million tons sold was 9% higher than the volume in 2012 as a result of our investment in recycling centers along with higher organic volumes.
cost of operations cost of operations includes labor and related benefits, which consists of salaries and wages, health and welfare benefits, incentive compensation and payroll taxes. it also includes transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations; maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles, equipment and containers, including related labor and benefit costs; transportation and subcontractor costs, which include costs for independent haulers that transport our waste to disposal facilities and costs for local operators who provide waste handling services associated with our national accounts in markets outside our standard operating areas; fuel, which includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles, net of fuel tax credits; disposal franchise fees and taxes, consisting of landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees and royalties; landfill operating costs, which includes financial assurance, leachate disposal, remediation charges and other landfill maintenance costs; risk management, which includes casualty insurance premiums and claims; cost of goods sold, which includes material costs paid to suppliers associated with recycled commodities; and other, which includes expenses such as facility operating costs, equipment rent and gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations.
labor and related benefits                $1,724.1         19.6   %          $1,651.6         19.6   %          $1,573.9         19.4   %
these cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies. as such, you should take care when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies.
•   labor and related benefits increased due to increased hourly and salaried wages as a result of merit increases and higher collection volumes. the central and east regions experienced unfavorable weather conditions during the first quarter of 2014, which contributed to increases in labor expense, resulting from lower labor productivity.
•   transfer and disposal costs increased primarily due to higher collection volumes. during each of 2014 and 2013, approximately 68% of the total waste volume we collected was disposed at landfill sites that we own or operate (internalization).
•   maintenance and repairs expense increased due to higher collection volume, cost of parts, internal labor, third party truck repairs, vehicle complexity and costs associated with our fleet maintenance initiative.
•   our fuel costs decreased due to our continued conversion to lower cost cng, lower prices of diesel fuel, and higher alternative fuel tax credits recognized in 2014. the national average fuel cost per gallon for 2014 was $3.83 compared to $3.92 for 2013, a decrease of $0.09 or approximately 2%.
•   landfill operating expenses increased due to volume increases in our landfill line of business. additionally, during 2013, we recorded favorable remediation adjustments of $17.1 million, of which $15.0 million relates to changes in the estimated timing of payments for our remediation obligations, which did not recur in 2014.
•   risk management expenses increased primarily due to unfavorable actuarial development in our vehicle liability program in 2014, compared to favorable actuarial development in our workers' compensation, vehicle liability and general liability insurance programs in 2013. during 2014, we continued to see favorable development in our workers' compensation program.
•   cost of goods sold relates to rebates paid for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. cost of goods sold in aggregate dollars increased primarily due to an increase in brokering and production of recycled commodity volumes.
•   other expenses increased primarily due to higher facility operating costs, including property taxes related to infrastructure investments. other expenses also increased due to higher utility costs associated with the unfavorable weather conditions experienced in our central and east regions during the first quarter of 2014, as well as $4.8 million of 2012 alternative fuel tax credits recognized during the first quarter of 2013, which did not recur in 2014.
•   during 2014, we updated our cost and timeline estimates to build and operate a leachate management facility and related infrastructure, manage the remediation area and monitor our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri. accordingly, we recorded environmental remediation charges of $210.6 million. additionally, we recorded certain remediation charges for the superfund site. during 2013, we recorded environmental remediation charges in the amount of $108.7 million to manage the remediation area and monitor the site.
•   labor and related benefits increased due to increased hourly and salaried wages as a result of merit increases, health care costs and collection volumes.
•   transfer and disposal costs increased primarily due to higher prices and volumes disposed at third party sites. during 2013, approximately 68% of the total waste volume we collected was disposed at landfill sites that we own or operate (internalization) compared to 67% for 2012.
•   maintenance and repairs expense increased due to higher collection volume, cost of parts, internal labor, third party truck repairs and costs associated with our fleet maintenance initiative. container and compactor maintenance had an unfavorable impact on maintenance and repairs expense due primarily to increased container repairs resulting from unit growth in our commercial and industrial lines of business.
•   our fuel costs in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue decreased $13.4 million and 0.4%, respectively, due to our continued conversion to lower cost cng and alternative fuel tax credits. average fuel costs per gallon for 2013 were $3.92 compared to $3.97 for 2012, a decrease of 1%.
•   risk management expenses decreased primarily due to favorable actuarial development, primarily in our auto liability insurance reserves.
•   cost of goods sold in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue increased $18.2 million and 0.2%, respectively, primarily due to an increase in both the volume of commodities sold and the average cost per ton for commodities.
•   included in other cost of operations is occupancy and facility costs, which increased $7.5 million primarily due to increased facility maintenance expense.
•   we recorded environmental remediation charges at our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri of $108.7 million in june 2013 and $74.1 million during 2012 to manage the remediation area and monitor the site.
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment in aggregate dollars increased primarily due to higher acquisition costs of replacement vehicles and an increased number of cng vehicles in our fleet, which are more expensive to purchase than diesel vehicles. in addition, we made increased investments in new and upgraded recycling infrastructure projects that became operational over the past several quarters.
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment in aggregate dollars increased $24.0 million, primarily due to higher costs of residential side loaders for automating our residential collection routes and an increased number of cng vehicles. in addition, we made increased investments in new and upgraded recycling infrastructure projects that became operational over the past several quarters.
amortization of other intangible assets and other assets expenses for amortization of other intangible assets and other assets were $68.4 million, $70.7 million and $70.1 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, or, 0.8%, 0.8% and 0.9% of revenue, for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. our other intangible assets and other assets primarily relate to customer relationships, franchise agreements, other municipal agreements, favorable lease assets and, to a lesser extent, non-compete agreements and trade names. the decline in amortization is the result of certain intangible assets now being fully amortized, partially offset by assets acquired in the acquisitions of various solid waste businesses throughout the year.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, health and welfare benefits, and incentive compensation for corporate and field general management, field support functions, sales force, accounting and finance, legal, management information systems, and clerical and administrative departments. other expenses include rent and office costs, fees for professional services provided by third parties, legal settlements, marketing, investor and community relations services,
these cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies. as such, you should take care when comparing our selling, general and administrative expenses by cost component to those of other companies.
salaries increased primarily due to higher wages resulting from merit increases, increased headcount and management incentive pay.
other selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to costs associated with strategic growth initiatives as well as costs incurred with the acquisition of various solid waste businesses.
salaries increased $6.0 million, but remained relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue at 6.5% and 6.6% for 2013 and 2012, respectively. during 2013, we recorded severance costs due to management departures, and higher salaries, payroll taxes and benefits resulting from merit increases and management incentive pay, partially offset by lower salaries expense in connection with the reorganization.
negotiation and withdrawal costs - central states pension and other funds during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded charges to earnings of $1.5 million, primarily related to costs associated with our 2013 withdrawal from the fund. during the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, we recorded charges to earnings of $157.7 million and $35.8 million, respectively, primarily related to our negotiation and withdrawal liability from the fund.
for additional discussion and detail regarding our obligations to the fund, see our central states, southeast and southwest areas pension fund discussion in note 11, employee benefit plans, to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k.
loss (gain) on disposition of assets and impairments, net during 2014, we recorded a charge to earnings of $20.0 million primarily related to costs associated with one of our divested landfills, of which $14.1 million relates to closure and post-closure costs and $5.9 million relates to remediation expenditures.
during 2013, we recorded a net gain on disposition of assets and impairments of $1.9 million, primarily related to the contingent sales price of $1.0 million received in connection with a 2011 business divestiture in our west region.
during 2012, we recorded a net gain on disposition of assets and impairments of $2.7 million, primarily due to a $5.5 million net gain on a divestiture of a collection business in our east region and a sale of certain assets associated with our rail logistics business.
restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of 2012, we announced a restructuring of our field and corporate operations to create a more efficient and competitive company. these changes included consolidating our field regions from four to three and our areas from 28 to 20, relocating office space, and reducing administrative staffing levels. during 2014, we incurred costs of $1.8 million due to a change in estimate of amounts recoverable from sublet income associated with abandoned office space with non-cancellable lease terms. during 2013 and 2012, we incurred $8.6 million and $11.1 million of restructuring charges, respectively, which consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits, relocation benefits, and the closure of offices with lease agreements with non-cancelable terms.
interest expense the following table provides the components of interest expense, including accretion of debt discounts and accretion of discounts primarily associated with environmental and risk insurance liabilities assumed in the allied acquisition (in millions of dollars):
interest expense on debt and capital lease obligations      $310.3              $319.8              $338.5
less: capitalized interest                                    (6.4   )            (7.3   )            (8.4   )
during the second half of 2013, we entered into various interest rate swap agreements relative to our 4.750% fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023. these swap agreements, which were designated as fair value hedges, have a total notional value of $300.0 million and resulted in a $7.7 million reduction in interest expense during 2014, compared to a $2.0 million reduction in interest expense during 2013. additionally, there were lower variable rates on our tax-exempt financings, which also contributed to the reduction in interest expense during 2014. during 2014, 2013 and 2012, cash paid for interest was $320.2 million, $324.0 million and $341.0 million, respectively.

income taxes our provision for income taxes was $337.4 million, $262.1 million and $251.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. our effective income tax rate was 38.1%, 30.8% and 30.6% for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. our 2014 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the realization of tax credits and lower state rates due to changes in estimates of approximately $5.1 million. our 2013 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by approximately $42 million for adjustments to our valuation allowance, primarily due to the determination it was more likely than not the company would be able to realize certain state loss carryforwards. in addition, our 2013 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by approximately $14 million due to a settlement for tax years 2009 to 2010 with the internal revenue service (irs) appeals division and the joint committee of taxation. lastly, our 2013 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the realization of tax credits and lower state rates due to changes in estimates of approximately $9.6 million.
our 2012 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the settlement with the irs appeals division for tax years 2004 to 2008. this settlement benefited our 2012 tax provision by approximately $35 million. the 2012 effective tax rate was also favorably impacted by the realization of tax credits and lower state rates due to changes in estimates of $16.0 million.
we made income tax payments (net of refunds received) of approximately $382 million, $288 million and $185 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. cash paid for income taxes increased over the periods primarily due to higher expected taxable income and the related deductible timing differences associated with certain remediation charges.

corporate entities include legal, tax, treasury, information technology, risk management, human resources, corporate accounts, closed landfills and other administrative functions. national accounts revenue included in corporate entities represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators. consequently, substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations.
east region revenue for 2014 increased 1.7% from 2013, due primarily to increases in average yield in all lines of business, except for landfill construction and demolition. volumes increased in our commercial and industrial collection, transfer station, and landfill special waste and construction and demolition lines of business but were partially offset by the decline in volume in our residential collection line of business. these increases were also partially offset by lower recycled commodity revenue.
•   cost of operations unfavorably impacted operating income margin primarily due to higher repair and maintenance costs, increased labor and benefits and utility costs resulting largely from unfavorable weather conditions during the first quarter of 2014. these unfavorable items were partially offset by lower cost of goods sold and decreased fuel costs due to lower diesel fuel prices.
•   depreciation and amortization of property and equipment unfavorably impacted operating income margin due to higher acquisition costs of replacement vehicles. landfill depletion and amortization also unfavorably impacted operating income margin due to an overall increase in the average depletion rate, partially offset by favorable adjustments for asset retirement obligations of $3.2 million, compared to net unfavorable adjustments of $4.7 million in 2013.
central region revenue for 2014 increased 4.4% from 2013 primarily due to average yield increases in our commercial and industrial collection and transfer station lines of business, as well as volume increases in all collection and landfill lines of business, except for construction and demolition. these increases were partially offset by lowered recycled commodity revenue and a decrease in volume in our transfer station line of business.
•   landfill depletion was favorably impacted by the amortization adjustments of $5.6 million due primarily to an increase in deemed probable airspace expansion at one of our active solid waste landfills in 2014. partially offsetting this favorable impact was higher depletion rates resulting from the acquisition of the san angelo landfill in the third quarter of 2014.
•   gain on disposition of assets and impairments, net unfavorably impacted operating income margin during 2014 primarily due to contingent sale price of $1.0 million received in 2013 on a 2011 business divestiture.
corporate entities operating loss in our corporate region increased from $501.8 million for 2013 to $525.8 million for 2014. the increase in operating loss primarily relates to unfavorable remediation and litigation adjustments in 2014 of $227.1 million recorded at our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri, compared to $108.7 million recorded in 2013. additionally, during 2013, we recorded a net favorable adjustment of $8.3 million resulting from a change in our estimated future bad debts, favorable remediation adjustments of $17.1 million relating to changes in the estimated timing of payments for our remediation obligations and a favorable remediation adjustment for a closed landfill site of $12.1 million, which did not recur in 2014. partially offsetting this increase in operating loss was a charge to earnings of $140.7 million in 2013 for our partial withdrawal liability from the fund and puerto rico multiemployer pension plans, which also did not recur in 2014.
•   cost of operations unfavorably impacted operating income during 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to higher labor and benefits and repair and maintenance costs. these unfavorable items were partially offset by lower fuel expenses due to lower prices of diesel fuel and reduced risk management expenses. cost of goods sold increased for 2013 from 2012 primarily due to a higher volume of commodities sold.
•   net gains on disposition of assets and impairments unfavorably impacted operating income during 2013 compared to 2012, primarily as a result of a $5.5 million net gain on the divestiture of a collection business and the sale of certain assets associated with our rail logistics business in 2012.
•   cost of operations unfavorably impacted operating income due to higher labor and benefits, repair and maintenance, and cost of goods sold. cost of goods sold increased for 2013 from 2012 primarily due to a higher volume of commodities sold.
•   cost of operations favorably impacted operating income margin primarily due to lower fuel costs, which were primarily driven by increased usage of cng and alternative fuel credits, offset by other operating cost increases.
•   during 2013, we recorded a net gain on disposition of assets and impairments of $1.9 million, primarily related to contingent sale price of $1.0 million received during the first quarter of 2013 in connection with a 2011 business divestiture and the disposal of a business in one market, which resulted in a gain of $0.9 million and proceeds of $1.7 million.
corporate entities during 2013, the corporate entities had operating loss of $501.8 million compared to $314.4 million for 2012. operating loss for 2013 was adversely impacted by a $108.7 million charge recorded in connection with remediation at our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri, as compared to $74.1 million of charges recorded in 2012, a charge to earnings of $140.7 million during 2013 for our withdrawal liability from the fund and puerto rico multiemployer pension plans, as compared to $30.7 million of charges recorded in 2012, and certain legal settlement charges in 2013 of $31.3 million.
landfill and environmental matters our landfill costs include daily operating expenses, costs of capital for cell development, costs for final capping, closure and post-closure, and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance. daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal, methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance, interim cap maintenance, and costs associated with applying daily cover materials. we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred. we use life cycle accounting and the units-of-consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development. in life cycle accounting, certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site, including excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems, installation of groundwater monitoring wells, and other costs associated with acquiring and developing the site. obligations associated with final capping, closure and post-closure are capitalized and amortized on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed.
cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers. our operating and accounting personnel use these estimates to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs. changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs, available airspace, inflation and applicable regulations. changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates, changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted.

changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information.
as of december 31, 2014, we owned or operated 189 active solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 4,845.8 million in-place cubic yards. total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace. engineers develop these estimates at least annually using information provided by annual aerial surveys. as of december 31, 2014, total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 4,584.1 million in-place cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 261.7 million in-place cubic yards of probable expansion airspace. before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and, therefore, included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity, it must meet all of our expansion criteria. see note 2, summary of significant accounting policies, and note 8, landfill and environmental costs, to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k for further information. also see our "critical accounting judgments and estimates" section of this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
as of december 31, 2014, ten of our landfills met all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity. at projected annual volumes, these ten landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 49 years, including probable expansion airspace. the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 66 years. we have
other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for treatment as probable expansion airspace.
the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available and probable disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december 31, 2014:

final capping, closure and post-closure costs as of december 31, 2014, accrued final capping, closure and post-closure costs were $1,144.3 million, of which $87.9 million are current and $1,056.4 million are long-term as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
bridgeton landfill.  as of december 31, 2014, the remediation liability recorded for our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri was $240.3 million, of which $30 million is expected to be paid during 2015. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we paid $64.3 million related to construction of a leachate management facility and related infrastructure, as well as management and monitoring of the remediation area. during the three months ended march 31, 2014, we recorded a charge to earnings of $36.1 million, primarily related to the design and construction of a leachate management facility. as the nature and extent of our leachate remediation efforts continued to change, it became necessary to upgrade treatment facility design features and infrastructure. in the third quarter of 2014, we completed construction of the leachate management facility, but it was not functioning at full capacity and was still in a testing mode. in the fourth quarter of 2014, we updated our cost and timeline estimates to operate the leachate management facility, manage the remediation area and monitor the site. accordingly, we recorded an environmental remediation charge of $174.5 million. we expect the facility will function at full capacity in the first half of 2015. we continue to work with state and federal regulatory agencies on our remediation efforts.  from time to time, this may require us to modify our future operating timeline and procedures, which could result in changes to our expected liability. we believe the remaining reasonably possible high end of our range would be approximately $160 million higher than the amount recorded as of december 31, 2014.
congress landfill. in august 2010, congress development company agreed with the state of illinois to have a final consent order (final order) entered by the circuit court of illinois, cook county. pursuant to the final order, we have agreed to continue to implement certain remedial activities at the congress landfill. the remediation liability recorded as of december 31, 2014 is $83.4 million, of which $5.0 million is expected to be paid during 2015. we believe the remaining reasonably possible high end of our range would be approximately $70 million higher than the amount recorded as of december 31, 2014.
it is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the liabilities noted above to reflect the effects of new or additional information, to the extent that such information impacts the costs, timing or duration of the required actions. future changes in our estimates of the costs, timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

cash flows provided by operating activities the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2014 and 2013 are summarized below:
changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects of business acquisitions and divestitures, decreased our cash flow from operations by $295.6 million in 2014 compared to a decrease of $256.6 million in 2013, primarily as a result of the following:
•   our accounts receivable, exclusive of the change in allowance for doubtful accounts and customer credits, increased $54.3 million during 2014 due to the timing of billings, net of collections, compared to a $61.6 million increase in 2013. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, our days sales outstanding was 38 days, or 25 and 26, respectively, net of deferred revenue.
•   our prepaid expenses and other assets increased $41.3 million during 2014, which is primarily due to the timing of withdrawals to fund payroll, compared to an $11.4 million increase in 2013.
•   cash paid for income taxes was approximately $382 million and $288 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase was primarily due to higher expected taxable income and the related deductible timing differences associated with certain remediation charges.
•   cash paid for restructuring expenditures was $14.5 million lower during 2014 compared to 2013 due to the expiration of severance and other employee termination benefits, relocation benefits and the closure of offices with lease agreements with non-cancelable terms associated with our restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of 2012.
•   cash paid for capping, closure and post-closure obligations was $31.0 million lower during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to a $17.8 million payment to settle our post-closure liability for one of our divested closed landfill sites in 2013.
•   cash paid for remediation obligations was $23.1 million lower during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to remediation activity at our closed bridgeton landfill in missouri.
•   our other liabilities decreased $48.0 million during 2014, which is primarily due to the timing of payment for certain tax related accruals and other accrued expenses, as compared to a $2.4 million increase in 2013.
the most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2013 and 2012 are summarized below:
changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects of business acquisitions and divestitures, decreased our cash flow from operations by $256.6 million in 2013 compared to a decrease of $377.0 million in 2012, primarily as a result of the following:
•   our accounts receivable, exclusive of the change in allowance for doubtful accounts and customer credits, increased $61.6 million during 2013 due to the timing of billings, net of collections, as compared to a $37.2 million increase in 2012. as of december 31, 2013 and 2012, the number of days our sales were outstanding were 38 days, or 25 net of deferred revenue.
•   we paid $15.8 million during 2013 related to a restructuring announced during the fourth quarter of 2012. during 2012, we paid synergy incentive plan bonuses of $68.1 million. we also paid $2.2 million during 2012 in connection with the restructuring announced in the fourth quarter of 2012.
•   cash paid for capping, closure and post-closure obligations was $8.0 million higher during 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to a $17.8 million payment to settle our post-closure liability for one of our closed landfill sites.
•   our other liabilities increased $16.9 million during 2013, which is primarily due to the timing of payment for certain payroll related accruals and other accrued expenses, as compared to a $55.3 million decrease in 2012.
cash flows used in investing activities the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in investing activities are summarized below:
•   capital expenditures during 2014 were $862.5 million compared with $880.8 million for 2013 and $903.5 million for 2012. property and equipment received during 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $872.9 million, $879.8 million and $866.7 million, respectively.
•   during 2014, we paid $195.7 million for acquisitions of collection, landfill, transfer station and recycling businesses in all three regions. during 2013, we paid $68.7 million for acquisitions of collection businesses in all three regions. during 2012, we paid $95.3 million for acquisitions of collection, recycling and transfer station businesses in all three regions. in addition, during 2014, 2013 and 2012, we paid $8.0 million, $4.9 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in relation to holdback liabilities resulting from acquisitions.
•   decreases (increases) in our restricted cash and marketable securities balances were $70.8 million, $(5.5) million and $23.2 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. changes in restricted cash and marketable securities are primarily related to the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for our capital needs, collateral for certain of our obligations and amounts held in trust as a guarantee of performance. funds received from issuances of tax-exempt bonds are deposited directly into trust accounts by the bonding authority at the time of issuance. the decrease of $70.8 million during 2014 was due to a release of restricted investments related to a change in certain of our closure and post-closure obligation requirements and a release of restricted investments related to our insurance programs. the increase of $5.5
million during 2013 is primarily due to investments in restricted cash related to our insurance program. we received $50.0 million, $25.0 million and $24.7 million in connection with an issuance of tax-exempt bonds during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. reimbursements from the trust for qualifying expenditures or for repayments of the related tax-exempt bonds are presented as cash provided by investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. such reimbursements amounted to $51.1 million, $27.8 million and $22.4 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. during 2012, we paid $29.5 million to settle a legal matter that was funded through a restricted escrow account in 2011.
we intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand, restricted cash held for capital expenditures, cash flows from operations, our revolving credit facilities, and tax-exempt bonds and other financings. we expect to use primarily cash for consideration paid for future business acquisitions.
cash flows used in financing activities the most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in financing activities are summarized below:
•   payments of notes payable and long-term debt, net of proceeds were $15.1 million during 2014 compared to net payments of $58.9 million during 2013 and net proceeds of $50.8 million during 2012. for a more detailed discussion, see the "financial condition" section of this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
•   cash premiums and fees paid in connection with the issuance of our debt and to settle certain hedging relationships were $4.0 million, $1.6 million and $43.3 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. for a more detailed discussion, see our "financial condition" section of this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
financial condition cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2014, we had $75.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $115.6 million of restricted cash deposits and restricted marketable securities, including $20.9 million of restricted cash and marketable securities held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities, $16.8 million pursuant to a holdback arrangement, $26.7 million of restricted cash and marketable securities pledged to regulatory agencies and governmental entities as financial guarantees of our performance related to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations at our landfills and $50.4 million of restricted cash and marketable securities related to our insurance obligations.
we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments, share repurchases and debt repayments. debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise. we believe that our excess cash, cash from operating activities and our availability to draw from our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due.
in the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings. we also may explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable. early extinguishment of debt will result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repaid. the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs.
credit facilities in june 2014, we entered into a $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the replacement credit facility), which replaced our $1.0 billion credit facility maturing in april 2016. the replacement credit facility matures in june 2019 and includes a feature that allows us to increase availability, at our option, by an aggregate amount up to $500.0 million through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders. at our option, borrowings under the replacement credit facility bear interest at a base rate, or a eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings (all as defined in the agreements).
contemporaneous with the execution of the replacement credit facility, we entered into amendment no. 3 to our existing $1.25 billion unsecured credit facility (the existing credit facility and, together with the replacement credit facility, the credit facilities), to reduce the commitments under the existing credit facility to $1.0 billion and conform certain terms of the existing credit facility with those of the replacement credit facility. amendment no. 3 does not extend the maturity date of the existing credit facility, which matures in may 2017. the existing credit facility also maintains the feature that allows us to increase availability, at our option, by an aggregate amount of up to $500.0 million, through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders.
the credit agreements require us to comply with certain financial and other covenants. we may pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants. compliance with covenants is a condition for any incremental borrowings under our credit facilities and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans (which would adversely affect our liquidity). as of december 31, 2014, our ebitda to interest ratio was 6.37 compared to the 3.00 minimum required by the covenants, and our total debt to ebitda ratio was 3.16 compared to the 3.75 maximum allowed by the covenants. in connection with entering into the replacement credit facility and amendment no. 3 to the existing credit facility, our maximum total debt to ebitda ratio was increased to 3.75 for each fiscal quarter ending before and including december 31, 2015, and 3.50 for each fiscal quarter ending thereafter. as of december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with the covenants under our credit facilities, and we expect to be in compliance throughout 2015.
ebitda, which is a non-u.s. gaap measure, is calculated as defined in our credit facility agreements. in this context, ebitda is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to ebitda used by other companies or used by us for other purposes.
availability under our credit facilities totaled $1,615.4 million and $1,527.9 million as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and can be used for working capital, capital expenditures, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had no borrowings under our credit facilities. we had $615.1 million and $722.1 million of letters of credit outstanding under our credit facilities as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
we have a $125.0 million unsecured credit facility agreement (the uncommitted credit facility) bearing interest at libor, plus an applicable margin. our uncommitted credit facility is subject to facility fees defined in the agreement, regardless of usage. we can use borrowings under the uncommitted credit facility for working capital and other general corporate purposes. the agreements governing our uncommitted credit facility require us to comply with covenants. the uncommitted credit facility may be terminated by either party at any time. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had no borrowings under our uncommitted credit facility. the uncommitted credit facility may be terminated at any time by either party.
in january 2015, we entered into a $20.0 million uncommitted credit facility agreement (the puerto rico facility) that matures in 2016 and bears interest at libor plus an applicable margin. we can use borrowings under the puerto rico facility for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
senior notes and debentures as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had $5,863.6 million and $5,844.4 million, respectively, of unsecured senior notes and debentures outstanding with maturities ranging from 2018 to 2041.
interest rate swap agreements during the second half of 2013, we entered into various interest rate swap agreements relative to our 4.750% fixed rate senior notes due in may 2023. these transactions were entered into to reduce overall borrowing costs and rebalance our debt portfolio's ratio of fixed to floating interest rates. as of december 31, 2014, our outstanding swap agreements have a total notional value of $300.0 million and require us to pay interest at floating rates based on changes in libor, and receive interest at a fixed rate of 4.750%. for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $7.7 million and $2.0 million, respectively, as offsetting benefits to our interest expense from these swap agreements, which mature in may 2023.
tax-exempt financings as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had $1,083.8 million and $1,087.7 million, respectively, of fixed and variable rate tax-exempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from 2015 to 2044. approximately 90% of our tax-exempt financings are remarketed quarterly by remarketing agents to effectively maintain a variable yield. the holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agents at the end of each interest period. to date, the remarketing agents have been able to remarket our variable rate unsecured tax-exempt bonds. these bonds have been classified as long-term because of our ability and intent to refinance them using availability under our credit facilities, if necessary.
as of december 31, 2014, we had $115.6 million of restricted cash and marketable securities, of which $20.9 million represented proceeds from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds and other tax-exempt financings and will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements. restricted cash and marketable securities also include amounts held in trust as a financial guarantee of our performance.
fuel hedges we use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices. we have entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases. the agreements qualified for, and were designated as, effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases (fuel hedges). for a summary of our outstanding fuel hedges as of december 31, 2014, see note 16, financial instruments, to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k.
the aggregate fair values of our outstanding fuel hedges as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 were current liabilities of $34.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively, and current assets of $6.7 million as of december 31, 2013, and have been recorded in other accrued liabilities and prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets, respectively.
the effective portions of the changes in fair values as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, net of tax, of $20.3 million and $3.9 million, respectively, have been recorded in stockholders' equity as components of accumulated other comprehensive income.
during 2014, approximately 20% of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements and we were able to recover approximately 78% of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees from customers. during 2013, approximately 19% of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements and we were able to recover approximately 74% of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees from certain of our customers.
recycling commodity hedges revenue from the sale of recycled commodities is primarily from sales of old corrugated cardboard and old newspaper. we use derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of these commodities. we have entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted old corrugated cardboard and old newspaper sales. these agreements qualified for, and were designated as, effective hedges of changes in the prices of certain forecasted recycling commodity sales (recycling commodity hedges). for a discussion of our outstanding recycling commodity hedges as of december 31, 2013, see note 16, financial instruments, to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k.
we had no outstanding recycling commodity hedges as of december 31, 2014. the aggregate fair values of the outstanding recycling commodity hedges as of december 31, 2013 were current assets of $0.3 million and current liabilities of $0.6 million, and have been recorded in other current assets and other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, respectively.
the effective portion of the change in fair value of our recycling commodity hedges as of december 31, 2013, net of tax, of $0.2 million has been recorded in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
for 2014 and 2013, approximately 6% and 24% of our sales volume of commodities were subject to cash flow hedges, respectively.
year endingdecember 31,             operatingleases           maturities ofnotes payable,capital leasesand other long-term debt           scheduled interest payment obligations            final capping,closure andpost-closure           remediation           unconditionalpurchasecommitments                 total
the present value of capital lease obligations is included in our consolidated balance sheets.
the estimated remaining final capping, closure and post-closure and remediation expenditures presented above are not inflated or discounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of december 31, 2014.
unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of (1) disposal related agreements that include fixed or minimum royalty payments, host agreements and take-or-pay and put-or-pay agreements and (2) other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements.
debt covenants our credit facilities contain financial covenants. we can pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants. as of december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our credit facilities. we were also in compliance with the non-financial covenants in the indentures relating to our senior notes as of december 31, 2014. we expect to be in compliance with our covenants during 2015.
failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our credit facilities, as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events, would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under our credit facilities to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreements. this could also have an adverse impact on the availability of financial assurances. in addition, maturity acceleration on our credit facilities constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments, including our senior notes, and, therefore, our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity. if such acceleration were to occur, we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness. we would likely have to seek an amendment under our credit facilities for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity, or asset sales, if necessary. we may be unable to amend our credit facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated.
financial assurance we must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping, closure and post-closure costs, and related to our performance under certain collection, landfill and transfer station contracts. we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds, letters of credit, or insurance policies (financial assurance instruments), or trust deposits, which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and post-closure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations. the financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and post-closure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill. generally, states require a third-party engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping, closure and post-closure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill. the amount of
financial assurance required can, and generally will, differ from the obligation determined and recorded under u.s. gaap. the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract. additionally, we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations. we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during 2015, although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change.
these financial assurance instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered indebtedness. because we currently have no liability for the financial assurance instruments, they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets; however, we record capping, closure and post-closure liabilities and insurance liabilities as they are incurred. the underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments, in excess of those already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, would be recorded if it is probable that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations. we do not expect this to occur.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations, other than operating leases and financial assurances, which are not classified as debt. we have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed, consolidated into or reflected in our reported financial position or results of operations. we have not guaranteed any third-party debt.
free cash flow we define free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with u.s. gaap, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment, as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
cash provided by operating activities              $1,529.8              $1,548.2              $1,513.8
for a discussion of the changes in the components of free cash flow, you should read our discussion regarding cash flows provided by operating activities and cash flows used in investing activities contained elsewhere in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the free cash flow table above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures. the following table reconciles property and equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 as follows (in millions of dollars):
we believe that presenting free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment received, plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment. it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy, which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided, maintaining our investment grade credit rating and minimizing debt, paying cash dividends and repurchasing common stock, and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization. in addition, free cash flow is a key metric
used to determine compensation. the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations. free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
contingencies for a description of our commitments and contingencies, see note 8, landfill and environmental costs, note 10, income taxes, and note 17, commitments and contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k.
critical accounting judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management. the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. such critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments.
we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas. residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast.
our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories, each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates:
•   landfill development costs that are capitalized as an asset.
•   landfill retirement obligations relating to our capping, closure and post-closure liabilities that result in a corresponding landfill retirement asset.
landfill development costs we use life-cycle accounting and the units-of-consumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site. in life-cycle accounting, all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized, and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. obligations associated with final capping, closure and post-closure are also capitalized, and amortized on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed. cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers.
site permits.    to develop, construct and operate a landfill, we must obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local, state and federal levels. the permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations. the initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval. during the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but before the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted.
•   changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes to the landfill site permitting process. these changes could make it more difficult and costly to obtain and maintain a landfill permit.
•   studies performed could be inaccurate, which could result in the denial or revocation of a permit and changes to accounting assumptions. conditions could exist that were not identified in the study, which may make the location not feasible for a landfill and could result in the denial of a permit. denial or revocation of a permit could impair the recorded value of the landfill asset.
•   actions by neighboring parties, private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain, maintain or expand permits could result in denial, revocation or suspension of a permit, which could adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill and could impair the recorded value of the landfill. as a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit, improved technical information as a project progresses, or changes in the anticipated economics associated with a project, we may decide to reduce the scope of, or abandon a project, which could result in an asset impairment.
technical landfill design.    upon receipt of initial regulatory approval, technical landfill designs are prepared. the technical designs, which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required, are reviewed by our environmental management group. the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval. upon approval of the technical designs, the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill.
•   changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require changes in the landfill technical designs. these changes could make it more difficult and costly to meet new design standards.
•   technical designs could be inaccurate and could result in increased construction costs, difficulty in obtaining a permit or the use of rates to recognize the amortization of landfill development costs and asset retirement obligations that are not appropriate.
permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity.    included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill. these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed, such as the depth of excavation, the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the side-slope construction. the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards. this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a site-specific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill.
•   estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements.
•   the density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions, including waste compaction practices, site design, climate and the nature of the waste.
•   capacity is defined in cubic yards but waste received is measured in tons. the number of tons per cubic yard varies by type of waste and our rate of compaction.
development costs.    the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes, installation of groundwater monitoring wells, construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site. we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with third-party bids or contractual arrangements, reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness, and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs. these development costs, together with any costs incurred to acquire, design and permit the landfill, including capitalized interest, are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred.
•   actual future costs of construction materials and third-party labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the level of demand and the availability of the required materials and labor. technical designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions, regulatory changes or legislative changes.
landfill development asset amortization.    to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations, we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a per-ton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill. the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill's operating life. the per-ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs (as described above) for the landfill, by the landfill's estimated remaining disposal capacity. the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted, but rather expressed in nominal dollars. this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period.
amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill, including acquisition costs, which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values. we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value. amortization rates are also influenced by site-specific engineering and cost factors.
•   changes in our future development cost estimates or our disposal capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization rates and will impact amortization expense prospectively. an unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction in disposal capacity could affect the ongoing economic viability of the landfill and result in asset impairment.
on at least an annual basis, we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill. these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually. changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually.
obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event. obligations related to closure and post-closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill. landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units-of-consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill, depending on the nature of the obligation. all obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value. fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our credit-adjusted, risk-free rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred. future costs for final capping, closure and post-closure are developed at least annually by engineers, and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections.
landfill capping.    as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity, we must cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit. these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill site process previously described.
closure and post-closure.    closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill stops receiving waste, but prior to being certified as closed. after the entire landfill has reached capacity and is certified closed, we must continue to maintain and monitor the site for a post-closure period, which generally extends for 30 years. costs associated with closure and post-closure requirements generally include maintenance of the site, the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems, and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste. costs associated with post-closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling, analysis and statistical reports, third-party labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance, transportation and disposal of leachate, and erosion control costs related to the final cap.
landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets.    estimates of the total future costs required to cap, close and monitor each landfill as specified by the landfill permit are updated annually. the estimates include inflation, the specific timing of future cash outflows, and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events. our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation, which is updated annually and is based upon the ten year average consumer price index (2.3% in 2014, and 2.5% in both 2013 and 2012).
the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and post-closure costs for each landfill are recorded as incurred on a per-ton basis. these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill.
capping, closure and post-closure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our credit-adjusted risk-free rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred (4.5% in 2014, 5.0% in 2013 and 4.75% in 2012).
retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average credit-adjusted risk-free rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities. this accretion is charged to operating expenses. actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made.
corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping, closure and post-closure liabilities. the retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a per-ton basis as disposal capacity is consumed. the per-ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset's net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity. a per-ton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event. closure and post-closure per-ton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill.
•   changes in legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in capping, closure activities or post-closure monitoring activities, types and quantities of materials used, or term of post-closure care, could cause changes in our cost estimates.
•   changes in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in the anticipated waste flow, changes in airspace compaction estimates or changes in the timing of expenditures for closed landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are recorded in results of operations prospectively. this could result in unanticipated increases or decreases in expense.
•   actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing, causing differences in timing of when amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping, closure and post-closure liabilities.
•   changes in inflation rates could impact our actual future costs and our total liabilities.
•   changes in our capital structure or market conditions could result in changes to the credit-adjusted risk-free rate used to discount the liabilities, which could cause changes in future recorded liabilities, assets and expense.
•   amortization rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill capping design, post-closure monitoring requirements, or the inflation or discount rate.
on an annual basis, we update our estimates of future capping, closure and post-closure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill. revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping, closure and post-closure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets. changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively, except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills, where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed.
permitted and probable disposal capacity.  disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit. we classify this disposal capacity as permitted. we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates, thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion. probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies, but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and that the successful completion of the expansion is probable. we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace. we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted. however, because some of these criteria are judgmental, they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted. in either of these scenarios, our amortization, depletion and accretion expense could change significantly. our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion airspace are as follows:
•   we own the land associated with the expansion airspace or control it pursuant to an option agreement;
•   we are committed to supporting the expansion project financially and with appropriate resources;
•   there are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated with the project, including political impediments;
•   the expansion is attainable within a reasonable time frame; and
•   we believe it is likely we will receive the expansion permit.
after successfully meeting these criteria, the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates. additionally, for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping, closure and post-closure rates, we include the incremental costs to develop, construct, close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity.
•   we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the final local, state or federal permits or due to other unknown reasons. if we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity, or the disposal capacity for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated, both our estimated total costs and disposal capacity will be reduced, which generally increases the rates we charge for landfill amortization and capping, closure and post-closure accruals. an unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could also cause an asset impairment.
environmental liabilities we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business. under current laws and regulations, we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate, including sites that we have acquired, or sites where we have (or a company that we have acquired has) delivered waste. our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater, surface water and soil contamination, as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs. to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites, we evaluate several factors, including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site, the required remediation methods, timing of expenditures, the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties. we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies. we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary. changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known. adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts. with the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of allied, environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis. environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of allied, which were initially estimated on a discounted basis, are accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense. adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases or decreases in these obligations and are calculated on a discounted basis as they were initially estimated on a discounted basis. these adjustments are charged to operating income when they are known. we perform a comprehensive review of our environmental obligations annually and also review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. we have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies.
•   we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of our environmental remediation liabilities. our estimates of these liabilities require assumptions about uncertain future events. thus, our estimates could change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of contamination, the required remediation methods, timing of expenditures, the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties identified, the financial viability of those parties, and the actions of governmental agencies or private parties with interests in the matter. the actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs, and any such adjustments could be material.
•   actual amounts could differ from the estimated liabilities as a result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue the matter to ultimate resolution.
•   an unanticipated environmental liability that arises could result in a material charge to our consolidated statement of income.
insurance reserves and related costs our insurance programs for workers' compensation, commercial general and auto liability, environmental and remediation liability, and employee-related health care benefits are subject to high deductible insurance policies. accruals for insurance or deductible reserves are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. we maintain high deductibles for commercial general liability, automobile liability and workers' compensation coverage, ranging from $3.0 million to $5.0 million.
•   incident rates, including frequency and severity, and other actuarial assumptions could change causing our current and future actuarially determined obligations to change, which would be reflected in our consolidated statement of income in the period in which such adjustment is known.
loss contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and regulatory matters, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. we determine whether to disclose material loss contingencies or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote, reasonably possible or probable, and whether it can be reasonably estimated. we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities. management develops its assessment based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies. we record and disclose loss contingencies pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance for such matter.
•   actual costs may vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments of the amount of damages.
•   loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and generally involve matters that are by their nature complex and unpredictable. if a loss contingency results in an adverse judgment or is settled for a significant amount, it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the period in which such judgment or settlement occurs.
evaluation criteria.    we test long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long-lived asset, a change in its physical condition, or new circumstances that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
•   our most significant asset impairment exposure, other than goodwill (which is discussed below), relates to our landfills. a significant reduction in our estimated disposal capacity as a result of unanticipated events such as regulatory developments, revocation of an existing permit or denial of an expansion permit, or changes in our assumptions used to calculate disposal capacity, could trigger an impairment charge.
recognition criteria.  if such circumstances arise, we recognize impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. we generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value.
goodwill recoverability we annually test goodwill for impairment at december 31 or when an indicator of impairment exists. we test goodwill for impairment using the two-step process. the first step is a screen for potential impairment, while the second step measures the amount of the impairment, if any. the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
we have defined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments: east, central and west. in determining fair value, we primarily use discounted future cash flows and operating results based on a comparative multiple of earnings or revenues.
significant estimates used in our fair value calculation using discounted future cash flows include: (1) estimates of future revenue and expense growth by reporting unit, which we estimate to range from 3% to 5%; (2) future estimated effective tax rates, which we estimate to be 40%; (3) future estimated capital expenditures as well as future required investments in working capital; (4) estimated discount rates, which we estimate to range between 7% and 8%; and (5) the future terminal value of the reporting unit, which is based on its ability to exist into perpetuity. significant estimates used in the fair value calculation using market value multiples include: (a) estimated future growth potential of the reporting unit; (b) estimated multiples of revenue or earnings a willing buyer is likely to pay; and (c) estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay.
in addition, we evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests, indicating a possible impairment. examples of such events or circumstances include: (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; (2) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; (3) a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof will be sold; (4) continued or sustained losses at a reporting unit; (5) a significant decline in our market capitalization as compared to our book value; or (6) the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit.
we assign assets and liabilities from our corporate operating segment to our three reporting units to the extent that such assets or liabilities relate to the cash flows of the reporting unit and would be included in determining the reporting unit's fair value.
in preparing our annual test for impairment as of december 31, 2014, we determined that our indicated fair value of total invested capital exceeded our total market capitalization. we believe one of the primary reconciling differences between the indicated fair value of total invested capital and our total market capitalization is due to a control premium. we believe the control premium represents the value a market participant could extract as savings and/or synergies by obtaining control.
as of december 31, 2014, we determined that the indicated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value by approximately 50% on average and, therefore, we noted no indicators of impairment at our reporting units.
our operating segments, which also represent our reporting units, are comprised of several vertically integrated businesses. when an individual business within an integrated operating segment is divested, goodwill is allocated to that business based on its fair value relative to the fair value of its operating segment.
•   future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with acquired businesses is impaired.
•   the valuation of identifiable goodwill requires significant estimates and judgment about future performance, cash flows and fair value. our future results could be affected if these current estimates of future performance and fair value change. for example, a reduction in long-term growth assumptions could reduce the estimated fair value of the operating segments to below their carrying values, which could trigger an impairment charge. similarly, an increase in our discount rate could trigger an impairment charge. any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets (other than non-deductible goodwill) and liabilities. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. in making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce our provision for income taxes.
our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. we are subject to u.s. federal income taxes and to the income taxes of numerous states and puerto rico. significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the combined income tax expense.
regarding the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements, we record a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. we recognize interest and penalties
related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income. accrued interest and penalties are included within other accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes and other long-term tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
•   income tax assets and liabilities established in purchase accounting for acquisitions are based on assumptions that could differ from the ultimate outcome of the tax matters. such adjustments would be charged or credited to earnings, unless they meet certain remeasurement criteria and are allowed to be adjusted to goodwill.
•   changes in the estimated realizability of deferred tax assets could result in adjustments to our provision for income taxes.
•   valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes are based on our judgment. if our judgments and estimates concerning valuation allowances and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards are incorrect, our provision for income taxes would change.
•   we are regularly under examination or administrative review by various taxing authorities. the internal revenue code and income tax regulations are a complex set of rules that we must interpret and apply. positions taken in tax years under examination or subsequent years are subject to challenge. accordingly, we may have exposure for additional tax liabilities arising from these audits if any positions taken by us or by companies we have acquired are disallowed by the taxing authorities.
•   we adjust our liabilities for uncertain tax positions when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, their ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimates of the tax liabilities. these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to our provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined.
defined benefit pension plans we currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan, the bfi retirement plan (the plan). the plan covers certain employees in the united states, including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements. the plan's benefit formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in the plan document. the benefits of approximately 97% of the current plan participants were frozen upon allied's acquisition of bfi in 1999.
our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and the internal revenue code, as amended by the pension protection act of 2006.
the plan's assets are invested as determined by our employee benefits committee. as of december 31, 2014, the plan assets were invested in fixed income funds, equity funds and cash. the employee benefits committee annually reviews and adjusts the plan's asset allocation as deemed necessary. as of december 31, 2014, the plan was underfunded by $4.2 million, compared to overfunded by $8.1 million as of december 31, 2013.
•   changes in the plan's investment mix and performance of the equity and bond markets and fund managers could impact the amount of pension income or expense recorded, the funded status of the plan and the need for future cash contributions.
assumptions.  the benefit obligation and associated income or expense related to the plan are determined based on assumptions concerning items such as discount rates, expected rates of return and average rates of compensation increases. our assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed necessary.
we determine the discount rate based on a model that matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the plan measurement date. where that timing does not correspond to a published high-quality bond rate, our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate. the yield on the bonds is used to derive a discount rate for the liability. if the discount rate were to increase by 1%, our benefit obligation would decrease by approximately $23 million. if the discount rate were to decrease by 1%, our benefit obligation would increase by approximately $27 million.
increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the periods benefits are earned. there are no participants in the plan that continue to earn service benefits.
•   our assumed discount rate is sensitive to changes in market-based interest rates. a decrease in the discount rate will increase our related benefit plan obligation.

item 7: management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following overview is a high-level discussion of our operating results, as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business. management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers provides important context for our results for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015, as well as our future prospects. this summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form 10-k, including in the "business" section and the "risk factors" above, the remainder of this "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a")", and the consolidated financial statements and related notes.
about electronic arts we develop, market, publish and distribute game software content and services that can be played by consumers on a variety of platforms, including video game consoles (such as the playstation 3 and 4 from sony, and the xbox 360 and xbox one from microsoft), pcs, mobile phones and tablets. we deliver our games and services to our players across multiple platforms, through multiple distribution channels, and directly (online and wirelessly). some of our games are based on our wholly-owned intellectual property (e.g., battlefield, mass effect, need for speed, dragon age, the sims, simcity, bejeweled, and plants vs. zombies), and some of our games leverage content that we license from others (e.g., fifa, madden nfl and star wars). we also publish and distribute games developed by third parties (e.g., titanfall). our goal is to develop our intellectual properties into year-round businesses available on a range of platforms. our products and services may be purchased through physical and online retailers, platform providers such as console manufacturers, providers of free-to-download pc games played on the internet, mobile carriers via streaming and digital downloads and directly through origin, our own digital distribution platform.
financial results total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015 was $4,515 million, an increase of $940 million, or 26 percent, as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31, 2014. net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015 was driven by fifa 14, fifa 15, and battlefield 4. at march 31, 2015, deferred net revenue associated with sales of online-enabled games decreased by $207 million as compared to march 31, 2014, directly increasing the amount of reported net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015. at march 31, 2014, deferred net revenue associated with sales of online-enabled games increased by $446 million as compared to march 31, 2013, directly decreasing the amount of reported net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31, 2014. disregarding the impact of the deferred net revenue of $287 million and $11 million of unrecognized cash flow hedging net gains, reported net revenue would have increased by approximately $298 million, or 7 percent, during the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31, 2014.
net income for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015 was $875 million as compared to $8 million for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2014. diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015 was $2.69 as compared to a diluted earnings per share of $0.03 for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2014. net income increased for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31, 2014 primarily as a result of a $940 million increase in net revenue and a $57 million decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by an $82 million increase in cost of revenue and a $51 million increase in income tax expenses.
international operations and foreign currency exchange impact. international net revenue was $2,559 million, or 57 percent of total net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015, compared to $2,065 million, or 58 percent of total net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31, 2014, an increase of $494 million, or 24 percent. we estimate that the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates due to translation during the second half of fiscal year 2015 (primarily the u.s. dollar strengthening against the euro) and related cash flow hedging activities, decreased reported international net revenue by approximately $30 million, or 1 percent, for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015. excluding the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates from translation and related cash flow hedging activities, we estimate that international net revenue would have increased by approximately $524 million, or 25 percent for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31, 2014. this increase is primarily due to our fifa and plants vs. zombies franchises, and titanfall, partially offset by decreased revenue in our simcity, crysis, and dead space franchises. in addition, our international investments and our cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and decline in value when the u.s. dollar strengthens against the currencies in which our international investments are denominated.
trends in our business digital transformation. our business continues to transform from a traditional packaged goods business model to one in which our games and services are sold and delivered via a network connection, with digitally-delivered content, features and services helping to extend the life of the respective game offering. for example, many of our products that traditionally have been sold only as packaged goods products can now also be purchased and downloaded via a network connection. we also include digitally-delivered content, features and services as part of the product offering, either made available for free or at additional cost. for example, the ultimate team mode incorporated into recent iterations of our fifa, madden nfl, nhl and nba franchises and expansion packs available digitally for our battlefield and sims franchises have kept many of our players engaged with those games for longer periods of time. additionally, our mobile and pc free-to-download games are available solely via digital delivery and are typically monetized through a business model through which we sell incremental content and/or features in discrete transactions. we also provide our ea access service for the xbox one which offers players access to a selection of ea games and other benefits for a monthly or annual fee.
we significantly increased our digital net revenue from $1,440 million in fiscal year 2013 to $1,833 million in fiscal year 2014 and $2,199 million during fiscal year 2015. we expect this portion of our business to continue to grow through fiscal year 2016 and beyond.
console system transition. we have made and will continue to make significant investments in products and services for the playstation 4 from sony and xbox one from microsoft, and we also expect to continue to develop and market products and services for the microsoft xbox 360 and the sony playstation 3. industry sales of major games for these legacy consoles declined significantly during our 2015 fiscal year. although the decline in sales for legacy consoles was less than we anticipated during fiscal year 2015, we think that this sales decline trend will continue. the success of our products and services for the new-generation consoles depends in part on the commercial success and adequate supply of, as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for, these consoles.
foreign currency exchange rates. international sales are a fundamental part of our business, and the significant strengthening of the u.s. dollar during the second half of fiscal year 2015 (particularly relative to the euro, british pound sterling, swedish krona and canadian dollar) had a negative impact on our reported international net revenues, but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses because these amounts were translated at lower rates in fiscal year 2015 than in fiscal year 2014. while we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risk, these activities are limited in the protection that they provide us and can themselves result in losses. we currently anticipate foreign currency exchange rates to have a negative impact on our expected reported net revenue in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015, but the strengthening of the u.s. dollar is expected to have a positive impact on our reported operating expenses as a significant portion of those expenses are incurred outside the united states.
mobile and pc free-to-download games. the proliferation of mobile phones and tablets has significantly increased the consumer base for mobile games. the broad consumer acceptance of free-to-download business models, which allow consumers to try new games with no up-front cost and pay for additional content or in-game items, has led to growth in the mobile gaming industry. likewise, the mass introduction and wide consumer acceptance of free-to-download, micro-transaction-based pc games played over the internet has also broadened our consumer base. we expect revenue generated from mobile and pc free-to-download games to remain an important part of our business.
we track an estimate of monthly active users ("maus") for our mobile business, which we believe is a useful indicator of player engagement trends for that business. for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015, we had average maus of over 165 million. maus are the aggregate number of individuals who accessed a particular game on a particular device in the last 30 days as of the measurement date. for our calculation, an individual who either plays two of our games on a single device, or the same game on two devices in the relevant period, would be counted as two users. average maus for a particular period is the average of the maus at each month-end during that period. maus are calculated using internal company data based on tracking the activity of user accounts. we also include in this calculation data provided by our third party publishing partners for certain games that we develop but we exclude information from third party titles that we publish. from time to time, we adjust the calculation for user activity that is inconsistent with our methodology. we believe that the numbers are reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement; however, factors relating to user activity may impact these numbers. our methodology for calculating maus may differ from the methodology used by other companies to calculate this metric.
concentration of sales among the most popular games. in all major segments of our industry, we see a large portion of games sales concentrated on the most popular titles, and many of those titles are sequels of prior games.  a significant portion of our revenue has historically been derived from games and services based on a few popular franchises. for example, in fiscal year 2015, net revenue generated from the sale of products and services associated with our three largest franchises accounted for approximately 54% of our net revenue. we expect this trend to continue in fiscal year 2016.
recent developments stock repurchase program. in may 2015, our board of directors authorized a new program to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock. this new stock repurchase program, which expires on may 31, 2017, supersedes and replaces the stock repurchase authorization approved in may 2014 under which we repurchased approximately 8.3 million shares for approximately $337 million during fiscal year 2015. under the new program, we may purchase stock in the open market or through privately-negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws, including pursuant to pre-arranged stock trading plans. the timing and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price, capital availability, regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions. we are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares under this program and it may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. we continue to actively repurchase shares.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("u.s. gaap"). the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities, and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown. as a result, actual results may differ materially from our estimates.
revenue recognition, sales returns and allowances, and bad debt reserves we derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software games, and related content (e.g., micro-transactions) and services on (1) video game consoles (such as the playstation 3 and 4 from sony, and the xbox 360 and xbox one from microsoft) and pcs, and (2) mobile phones and tablets. we evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in fasb accounting standards codification ("asc") 605, revenue recognition and asc 985-605, software: revenue recognition. we classify our revenue as either product revenue or service and other revenue.
product revenue. our product revenue includes revenue associated with the sale of software games or related content, whether delivered via a physical disc (e.g., packaged goods) or delivered digitally via the internet (e.g., full-game downloads, extra-content), and licensing of game software to third-parties. product revenue also includes revenue from mobile full-game downloads that do not require our hosting support (e.g., premium mobile games), and sales of tangible products such as hardware, peripherals, or collectors' items.
service and other revenue. our service revenue includes revenue recognized from time-based subscriptions and games or related content that requires our hosting support in order to utilize the game or related content (i.e., can only be played with an internet connection). this includes (1) entitlements to content that are accessed through hosting services (e.g., micro-transactions for internet-based, social network and free-to-download mobile games), (2) massively multi-player online ("mmo") games (both software game and subscription sales), (3) subscriptions for our battlefield premium, ea access and pogo-branded online game services, and (4) allocated service revenue from sales of software games with an online service element (i.e., "matchmaking" service). our other revenue includes advertising and non-software licensing revenue.
with respect to the allocated service revenue from sales of software games with a matchmaking service mentioned above, our allocation of proceeds between product and service revenue for presentation purposes is based on management's best estimate of the selling price of the matchmaking service with the residual value allocated to product revenue. our estimate of the selling price of the matchmaking service is comprised of several factors including, but not limited to, prior selling prices for the matchmaking service, prices charged separately by other third-party vendors for similar service offerings, and a cost-plus-margin approach. we review the estimated selling price of the online matchmaking service on a regular basis and use this methodology consistently to allocate revenue between product and service for software game sales with a matchmaking service.
we evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met:
•   evidence of an arrangement. evidence of an agreement with the customer that reflects the terms and conditions to deliver the related products or services must be present.
•   collection is deemed probable. collection is deemed probable if we expect the customer to be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as those amounts become due. if we determine that collection is not probable as the amounts become due, we generally conclude that collection becomes probable upon cash collection.
•   delivery. for packaged goods, delivery is considered to occur when a product is shipped and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer. for digital downloads, delivery is considered to occur when the software is made available to the customer for download. for services and other, delivery is generally considered to occur as the service is delivered, which is determined based on the underlying service obligation. if there is significant uncertainty of acceptance, revenue is recognized once acceptance is reasonably assured.
online-enabled games the majority of our software games and related content can be connected to the internet whereby a consumer may be able to download unspecified content or updates on a when-and-if-available basis ("unspecified updates") for use with the original game software. in addition, we may also offer an online matchmaking service that permits consumers to play against each other via the internet without a separate fee. u.s. gaap requires us to account for the consumer's right to receive unspecified updates or the matchmaking service for no additional fee as a "bundled" sale, or multiple-element arrangement.
we have an established historical pattern of providing unspecified updates (e.g., player roster updates to madden nfl 15) to online-enabled games and related content at no additional charge to the consumer. we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value ("vsoe") for these unspecified updates, and thus, as required by u.s. gaap, we recognize revenue from the sale of these online-enabled games and related content over the period we expect to offer the unspecified updates to the consumer ("estimated offering period").
estimated offering period because the offering period is not an explicitly defined period, we must make an estimate of the offering period. determining the estimated offering period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage. for example, in determining the estimated offering period for unspecified updates associated with our online-enabled games, we consider the period of time consumers are online as online connectivity is required. on an annual basis, we review consumers' online gameplay of all online-enabled games that have been released 12 to 24 months prior to the evaluation date. for example, if our evaluation date is april 1, 2014, we evaluate all online-enabled games released between april 1, 2012 and march 31, 2013. based on this population of games, for all players that register the game online within the first six months of release of the game to the general public, we compute the weighted-average number of days for each online-enabled game, based on when a player initially registers the game online to when that player last plays the game online. we then compute the weighted-average number of days for all online-enabled games by multiplying the weighted-average number of days for each online-enabled game by its relative percentage of total units sold from these online-enabled games (i.e., a game with more units sold will have a higher weighting to the overall computation than a game with fewer units sold). under a similar computation, we also consider the estimated period of time between the date a game unit is sold to a reseller and the date the reseller sells the game unit to an end consumer (i.e., time in channel). based on these two calculations we then consider the method of distribution. for example, physical software games sold at retail would have a composite offering period equal to the online gameplay plus time in channel as opposed to digitally distributed software games which are delivered immediately via digital download and thus have no concept of channel. additionally, we consider results from prior analyses, known online gameplay trends, as well as disclosed service periods for competitors' games in determining the estimated offering period for future sales.
while we consistently apply this methodology, inherent assumptions used in this methodology include which online-enabled games to sample, whether to use only units that have registered online, whether to weight the number of days for each game, whether to weight the days based on the units sold of each game, determining the period of time between the date of sale to reseller and the date of sale to the consumer and assessing online gameplay trends.
prior to july 1, 2013, for most sales, we estimated the offering period to be six months and recognized revenue over this period in the month after delivery. during the three months ended september 30, 2013, we completed our fiscal 2014 annual evaluation of the estimated offering period and noted that generally, consumers were playing our games online over a longer period of time. based on this, we concluded that for physical software sales made after june 30, 2013, the estimated offering period should be increased to nine months, resulting in revenue being recognized over a longer period of time. this change in estimate resulted in an estimated decrease to net revenue and net income of $474 million and a decrease of $1.50 of diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2014. during the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015, this change in estimate resulted in an estimated increase to net revenue and net income of $474 million and an increase of $1.46 of diluted earnings per share. the estimated offering period for digitally distributed games did not change and is six months. we completed our fiscal 2015 annual evaluation during the second quarter and determined that the estimated offering period for physical software sales and digital sales continues to be nine months and six months, respectively.
other multiple-element arrangements in some of our multiple-element arrangements, we sell tangible products with software and/or software-related offerings. these tangible products are generally either peripherals or ancillary collectors' items, such as figurines and comic books. revenue for these arrangements is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each deliverable using the relative selling prices of each deliverable in the arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy described below. if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the software deliverables as a group and then allocated to each software deliverable in accordance with asc 985-605.
we determine the selling price for a tangible product deliverable based on the following selling price hierarchy: vsoe (i.e., the price we charge when the tangible product is sold separately) if available, third-party evidence ("tpe") of fair value (i.e., the price charged by others for similar tangible products) if vsoe is not available, or our best estimate of selling price ("besp") if neither vsoe nor tpe is available. determining the besp is a subjective process that is based on multiple factors including, but not limited to, recent selling prices and related discounts, market conditions, customer classes, sales channels and other factors. in accordance with asc 605, provided the other three revenue recognition criteria other than delivery have been met, we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer as we have no further obligations.
we must make assumptions and judgments in order to (1) determine whether and when each element is delivered, (2) determine whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element, and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements, as applicable. changes to any of these assumptions and judgments, or changes to the elements in the arrangement, could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.
principal agent considerations in accordance with asc 605-45, revenue recognition: principal agent considerations, we evaluate sales of our interactive software games via third party storefronts, including digital storefronts such as xbox live marketplace, sony psn, apple app store, and google play, in order to determine whether or not we are acting as the principal or as an agent, which we consider in determining if revenue should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the storefront. key indicators that we evaluate in determining gross versus net treatment include but are not limited to the following:
•   the party responsible for delivery/fulfillment of the product or service to the end consumer
•   the party responsible for the billing, collection of fees and refunds to the consumer
•   the storefront and terms of sale that govern the consumer's purchase of the product or service
•   the party that sets the pricing with the consumer and has credit risk based on the evaluation of the above indicators, we have determined that we are generally acting as an agent and are not considered the primary obligor to consumers for our interactive software games distributed through third party digital storefronts. we therefore recognize revenue related to these arrangements on a net basis.
sales returns and allowances and bad debt reserves we reduce revenue primarily for estimated future returns and price protection which may occur with our distributors and retailers ("channel partners"). price protection represents our practice to provide our channel partners with a credit allowance to lower their wholesale price on a particular product in the channel. the amount of the price protection is generally the difference between the old wholesale price and the new reduced wholesale price. in certain countries for our pc and console packaged goods software products, we also have a practice of allowing channel partners to return older software products in the channel in exchange for a credit allowance. as a general practice, we do not give cash refunds.
when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances, we analyze the following: historical credit allowances, current sell-through of our channel partners' inventory of our software products, current trends in retail and the video game industry, changes in customer demand, acceptance of our software products, and other related factors. in addition, we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories, as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection in subsequent periods.
in the future, actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold software products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing software products. while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection allowances would change and would impact the total net revenue, accounts receivable and deferred net revenue that we report.
we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating the following: customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, historical experience, age of current accounts receivable balances, and changes in financial condition or payment terms of our customers. significant management judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period. the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly as a result of a change in any of the evaluation factors mentioned above.
fair value estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item in order to fairly present our financial statements. without an independent market or another representative transaction, determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the accounting.
there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value. these include (1) the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value, (2) the income approach, which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, future cash flows or future earnings) to a single present value amount, and (3) the cost approach, which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset. for many of our fair value estimates, including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets, we use the income approach. using the income approach requires the use of financial models, which require us to make various estimates including, but not limited to (1) the potential future cash flows for the asset or liability being measured, (2) the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows, (3) the time value of money associated with the expected receipt or payment of such cash flows, and (4) the inherent risk associated with the cash flows (risk premium). making these cash flow estimates is inherently difficult and subjective, and if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate, our financial results may be negatively impacted. furthermore, relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact to the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached. for example, a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired.
while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions, the following areas are the most sensitive to these assessments:
business combinations. we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities and contingencies assumed, acquired in-process technology, and contingent consideration issued in a business combination. our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various estimated useful lives. furthermore, the estimated fair value assigned to an acquired asset or liability has a direct impact on the amount we recognize as goodwill, which is an asset that is not amortized. determining the fair value of assets acquired requires an assessment of the highest and best use or the expected price to sell the asset and the related expected future cash flows. determining the fair value of acquired in-process technology also requires an assessment of our expectations related to the use of that technology. determining the fair value of an assumed liability requires an assessment of the expected cost to transfer the liability. determining the fair value of contingent consideration requires an assessment of the probability-weighted expected future cash flows over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled, and applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation. the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration payable are forecasted earnings. significant changes in forecasted earnings would result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. this fair value assessment is also required in periods subsequent to a business combination. such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
assessment of impairment of goodwill, intangibles, and other long-lived assets. current accounting standards require that we assess the recoverability of our finite lived acquisition-related intangible assets and other long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is potentially impaired. in order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred, management must make various assumptions about the estimated fair value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated future cash flows. for some assets, our estimated fair value is dependent upon predicting which of our products will be successful. this success is dependent upon several factors, such as which operating platforms will be successful in the marketplace. also, our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules. judgments and assumptions about future cash flows and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. they can be affected by a variety of factors, including but not limited to, significant negative industry or economic trends, significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the strategy of our overall business and significant under-performance relative to projected future operating results. when we consider such assets to be impaired, the amount of impairment we recognize is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
in assessing impairment on our goodwill, we first analyze qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. the qualitative factors we assess include long-term prospects of our performance, share price trends and market capitalization, and company specific events. if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we do not need to perform the two-step impairment test. if based on that assessment, we believe it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a two-step goodwill impairment test will be performed. the first step measures for impairment by applying fair value-based tests at the reporting unit level. the second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. reporting units are determined by the components of operating segments that constitute a business for which (1) discrete financial information is available, (2) segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component, and (3) whether the component has dissimilar economic characteristics to other components.
as of our last annual assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount and, as such, we did not need to perform the two-step impairment test. we have not identified any indicators of impairment since that assessment.
our business consists of developing, marketing and distributing video game software content and services using both established and emerging intellectual properties and our forecasts for emerging intellectual properties are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information and have an inherently higher risk of inaccuracy. if future forecasts are revised, they may indicate or require future impairment charges. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. actual future results may differ from those estimates.
royalties and licenses our royalty expenses consist of payments to (1) content licensors, (2) independent software developers, and (3) co-publishing and distribution affiliates. license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities, professional sports organizations, movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks, copyrights, personal publicity rights, content and/or other intellectual property. royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games. co-publishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of products.
royalty-based obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid. these royalty-based obligations are generally expensed to cost of revenue generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on the total projected net revenue for contracts with guaranteed minimums. significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract. because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue, it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors, including (1) the total number of titles subject to the contract, (2) the timing of the release of these titles, (3) the number of software units and amount of extra content that we expect to sell, which can be impacted by a number of variables, including product quality, number of platforms we release on, the timing of the title's release and competition, and (4) future pricing. determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products. furthermore, if we
conclude that we are unable to make a reasonably reliable forecast of projected net revenue, we recognize royalty expense at the greater of contract rate or on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. accordingly, if our future revenue projections change, our effective royalty rates would change, which could impact the amount and timing of royalty expense we recognize.
prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and co-publishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product, and therefore, we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product. accordingly, payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred. payments due after completion of the product (primarily royalty-based in nature) are generally expensed as cost of revenue.
our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments, which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor. when performance remains with the licensor, we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred, rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract. royalty liabilities are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next 12 months.
each quarter, we also evaluate the expected future realization of our royalty-based assets, as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product and service sales. any impairments or losses determined before the launch of a product are generally charged to research and development expense. impairments or losses determined post-launch are charged to cost of revenue. we evaluate long-lived royalty-based assets for impairment using undiscounted cash flows when impairment indicators exist. if impairment exists, then the assets are written down to fair value. unrecognized minimum royalty-based commitments are accounted for as executory contracts, and therefore, any losses on these commitments are recognized when the underlying intellectual property is abandoned (i.e., cease use) or the contractual rights to use the intellectual property are terminated.
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carryforwards. we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. in making this determination, we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified. it is generally difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is significant negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years. forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results. therefore, cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment.
in addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income, we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets, namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, the carry back of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law, and the implementation of tax planning strategies. evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments. each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence; this evaluation involves assumptions about future activity. certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets.
in fiscal year 2015, we reported u.s. pre-tax income, compared to pre-tax losses in each of the last seven fiscal years. we have not yet been able to establish a sustained level of profitability in the u.s. or other sufficient significant positive evidence to conclude that our u.s. deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. therefore, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against most of our u.s. deferred tax assets. it is reasonably possible that in fiscal year 2016 we will establish a sustained level of profitability in the u.s. as a result, it is possible that a significant portion of the $539 million valuation allowance recorded against our u.s. deferred tax assets at march 31, 2015 could be reversed by the end of fiscal year 2016.
in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain. as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods. this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate. these estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation, as well as with respect to other matters, such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities. the ultimate
resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations. in addition, changes in our business, including acquisitions, changes in our international corporate structure, changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets, changes in the geographic mix and amount of income, as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities, valuation allowances, applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audit and other matters, and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate.
impact of recently issued accounting standards in april 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-03, interest - imputation of interest (topic 835-30), which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by this asu. the disclosure requirements will be effective for annual periods (and interim periods within those annual periods) beginning after december 15, 2015, and will require retrospective application. early adoption is permitted. we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. the asu will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in u.s. gaap when it becomes effective. the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. the company is evaluating the effect that asu 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. the company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. the new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016. early application is not permitted. we are required to adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018; however, in april 2015, the fasb issued an exposure draft that would provide us with the option to adopt in either the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 or fiscal year 2019. we have not determined which of these two fiscal years we would adopt if the exposure draft is issued as final in its current form.
results of operations our fiscal year is reported on a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the saturday nearest march 31. our results of operations for the fiscal years ended march 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 each contained 52 weeks and ended on march 28, 2015, march 29, 2014, and march 30, 2013, respectively. for simplicity of disclosure, all fiscal periods are referred to as ending on a calendar month-end.
net revenue net revenue consists of sales generated from (1) video games sold as packaged goods or as digital downloads and designed for play on video game consoles (such as the playstation 3 and 4 from sony, and the xbox 360 and one from microsoft) and pcs, (2) video games for mobile phones and tablets, (3) separate software products and content and online game services associated with these products, (4) licensing our game software to third parties, (5) allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products, and (6) advertisements on our online web pages and in our games.
we provide two different measures of our net revenue. one of these measures is presented in accordance with u.s. gaap - net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue. the second measure is a non-gaap financial measure - net revenue before revenue deferral by revenue composition, which is primarily based on method of distribution. we use this second non-gaap financial measure internally to evaluate our operating performance, when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods, and when assessing the performance of our management team.
management places a greater emphasis and focus on assessing our business through a review of the net revenue before revenue deferral by revenue composition than by net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue. these two measures differ as (1) net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue reflects the deferral and recognition of revenue in periods subsequent to the date of sale due to u.s. gaap while net revenue before revenue deferral by revenue composition does not, and (2) both measures contain a different aggregation of sales from one another. for instance, service and other revenue does not include a portion of our full-game digital download and mobile sales that are fully included in our digital revenue. further, service and other revenue includes all of our revenue associated with mmo games while software sales associated with our mmos are included in either digital revenue or packaged goods and other revenue depending on whether the sale was a full-game digital download or a packaged goods sale.
net revenue for fiscal year 2015, net revenue was $4,515 million and increased $940 million, or 26 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2014. this increase was driven by a $1,481 million increase in revenue primarily from the fifa and madden nfl franchises, and titanfall. this increase was partially offset by a $541 million decrease in revenue primarily from the simcity, crysis, dead space, and ncaa football franchises, and star wars: the old republic.
net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue our net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was as follows (in millions):
2015                                2014                        $ change          % change net revenue:
product revenue for fiscal year 2015, product revenue was $2,568 million, primarily driven by fifa 15, fifa 14 and battlefield 4. product revenue increased $434 million, or 20 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2014. this increase was driven by an $837 million increase primarily from the fifa, madden nfl and dragon age franchises. this increase was partially offset by a $403 million decrease primarily from the crysis, dead space, ncaa football, tiger woods pga tour and army of two franchises.
service and other revenue for fiscal year 2015, service and other revenue was $1,947 million, primarily driven by fifa ultimate team, titanfall, and battlefield 4 premium. service and other revenue for fiscal year 2015 increased $506 million, or 35 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2014. this increase was driven by a $660 million increase primarily from titanfall and the fifa and plants vs zombies franchises. this increase was partially offset by a $154 million decrease primarily from simcity franchise, star wars: the old republic, and pogo-branded online games services.
supplemental non-gaap net revenue by revenue composition as we continue to evolve our business and more of our products are delivered to consumers digitally via the internet, we place a greater emphasis and focus on assessing our business through a review of net revenue by revenue composition.
net revenue before revenue deferral, a non-gaap financial measure that excludes the impact of revenue deferral and the recognition of revenue deferral on net revenue related to sales of online-enabled games and content, is provided in this section of md&a, including a discussion of the components of this measure: (1) packaged goods and other and (2) the components that comprise our digital revenue. a reconciliation to the corresponding measure calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap is provided in the discussion below.
"revenue deferral" in this "net revenue" section generally relates to sales of online-enabled games and content for which we do not have vsoe for unspecified updates to be delivered after the initial sale or for which we have a continuing service obligation. fluctuations in the revenue deferral are largely dependent upon the amounts of products that we sell with the online features and services previously discussed, while the recognition of revenue deferral for a period is also dependent upon (1) the amount deferred, (2) the period of time the software-related offerings and service obligations are to be provided, and (3) the timing of the sale.
our sales are generally deferred and recognized over an estimated nine-month period beginning in the month after shipment for physical games sold through retail and an estimated six-month period for digitally delivered games and content, and therefore, the related revenue recognized during the fiscal quarter ended march 31 is primarily due to sales that occurred during the preceding six-month period for digitally delivered games and content, and the preceding nine-month period for physical games sold through retail. consequently, most revenue deferrals incurred in the first quarter of a fiscal year are recognized within the same fiscal year; however, substantially all of the revenue deferrals incurred in the last month of a fiscal year will be recognized in the subsequent fiscal year.
we believe that excluding the impact of revenue deferral and the recognition of revenue deferral related to online-enabled games and content from our operating results is important to facilitate comparisons between periods in understanding our underlying sales performance for the period, and understanding our operations because all related costs of revenues are expensed as incurred instead of deferred and recognized ratably. we use this non-gaap financial measure internally to evaluate our operating performance, when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods, and when assessing the performance of our management team. while we believe that this non-gaap financial measure is useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap. in addition, this non-gaap financial measure may not be the same as non-gaap financial measures presented by other companies.

net revenue before revenue deferral packaged goods and other packaged goods revenue includes sales of software that is distributed physically. this includes (1) sales of our internally-developed and co-published game software distributed physically through traditional channels such as brick and mortar retailers, (2) our software licensing revenue from third parties (for example, makers of personal computers or computer accessories) who include certain of our products for sale with their products ("oem bundles"), and (3) sales through our switzerland distribution business. other revenue includes our non-software licensing revenue.
for fiscal year 2015, packaged goods and other net revenue before revenue deferral was $2,089 million, primarily driven by fifa 15, madden nfl 15, and dragon age: inquisition. packaged goods and other net revenue before revenue deferral for fiscal year 2015 decreased $139 million, or 6 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2014. this decrease was driven by a $650 million decrease in sales primarily from the battlefield, need for speed and ncaa football franchises. this decrease was partially offset by a $511 million increase in sales primarily from the dragon age, fifa, and fifa world cup franchises.
digital digital revenue includes sales of software distributed through direct download via the internet. this includes full-game downloads, extra content, subscriptions, advertising and other, and mobile revenue. digital revenue includes internally-developed and co-published game software distributed through our direct-to-consumer platform origin, distributed wirelessly through mobile carriers, or licensed to our third-party publishing partners who distribute our games digitally. full-game downloads are generally classified as product revenue with the exception of our mmo and full-game downloads related to games that require our hosting support in order to utilize the game or related content (e.g. titanfall and plants vs. zombies: garden warfare), which are classified as service revenue. subscriptions, advertising and other revenue and free-to-download mobile games are each generally classified as service and other revenue.
for fiscal year 2015, digital net revenue before revenue deferral was $2,230 million, an increase of $437 million, or 24%, as compared to fiscal year 2014. this increase is due to (1) a $96 million or 30 percent increase in full-game download sales primarily driven by dragon age: inquisition, fifa 15 and the sims 4, (2) a $165 million or 22 percent increase in extra content and free-to-download sales primarily driven by fifa ultimate team and madden ultimate team, (3) a $104 million or 40 percent increase in subscription sales primarily driven by battlefield 4 premium, and (4) a $72 million or 16 percent increase in mobile revenue primarily driven by madden nfl mobile, simcity buildit, fifa 15 mobile, and fifa online 3.
revenue deferral revenue deferral for fiscal year 2015 increased $186 million, or 6 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2014. this increase was primarily due to a $298 million increase in net revenue before revenue deferral related to our packaged goods and other and digital sales during fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014.
recognition of revenue deferral the recognition of revenue deferral for fiscal year 2015 increased $828 million, or 29 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2014. this increase was primarily due to (1) the increase in our estimated offering period from six to nine months, which was implemented during the second quarter of fiscal year 2014 for packaged goods sold through retail, and (2) an increase in digital and packaged goods sales during the preceding six and nine-month period. the change in estimated offering period resulted in an estimated increase to net revenue and net income of $474 million and an increase of $1.46 of diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015.
cost of revenue cost of revenue for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was as follows (in millions):

cost of product revenue cost of product revenue consists of (1) product costs, (2) certain royalty expenses for celebrities, professional sports and other organizations, and independent software developers, (3) manufacturing royalties, net of volume discounts and other vendor reimbursements, (4) expenses for defective products, (5) write-offs of post-launch prepaid royalty costs and losses on previously unrecognized licensed intellectual property commitments, (6) amortization of certain intangible assets, (7) personnel-related costs, and (8) warehousing and distribution costs. we generally recognize volume discounts when they are earned from the manufacturer (typically in connection with the achievement of unit-based milestones); whereas other vendor reimbursements are generally recognized as the related revenue is recognized.
cost of product revenue decreased by $4 million, or 0.4 percent in fiscal year 2015, as compared to fiscal year 2014. cost of product revenue decreased primarily due to an increase in net revenue before revenue deferral from our digital product sales that generally have lower costs than our packaged goods and other product sales during fiscal year 2015, as compared to the fiscal year 2014, partially offset by a loss of $122 million on a previously unrecognized licensed intellectual property commitment recognized during the three months ended june 30, 2014.
cost of service and other revenue cost of service and other revenue consists primarily of (1) royalty costs, (2) data center, bandwidth and server costs associated with hosting our online games and websites, (3) platform processing fees from operating our website-based games on third party platforms, and (4) credit card fees associated with our service revenue.
cost of service and other revenue increased by $86 million, or 27.3 percent in fiscal year 2015, as compared to fiscal year 2014. the increase was primarily due to an increase in royalty-related costs due to fifa ultimate team, madden ultimate team, and titanfall.
total cost of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015, total cost of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue decreased by 6.0 percent as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31, 2014. excluding the loss of $122 million on previously unrecognized license intellectual property recognized during three months ended june 30, 2014, total cost of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue decreased 8.8 percent as a result of an increase in our digital products and services that generally have a lower cost than our packaged goods and other products.
research and development research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred by our production studios for personnel-related costs, related overhead costs, contracted services, depreciation and any impairment of prepaid royalties for pre-launch products. research and development expenses for our online products include expenses incurred by our studios consisting of direct development and related overhead costs in connection with the development and production of our online games. research and development expenses also include expenses associated with our digital platform, software licenses and maintenance, and management overhead.
research and development expenses for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in millions):

research and development expenses decreased by $31 million, or 3 percent, in fiscal year 2015, as compared to fiscal year 2014. excluding the $20 million positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates due to translation and related cash flow hedging activities, we estimate that research and development would have decreased by $11 million. this $11 million decrease was primarily due to a $15 million decrease in personnel-related costs resulting from a reduction in headcount and a $17 million decrease in contracted services as a result of higher development contracted services in fiscal year 2014 due to titanfall, battlefield 4, and ea sports ufc as compared to the current fiscal year. these decreases were partially offset by a $21 million increase in facility-related costs primarily due to $6 million in operating costs for new office expansions and $5 million in certain facility closures.
marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses consist of personnel-related costs, related overhead costs, advertising, marketing and promotional expenses, net of qualified advertising cost reimbursements from third parties.

marketing and sales expenses decreased by $33 million, or 5 percent, in fiscal year 2015, as compared to fiscal year 2014. the decrease was primarily due to (1) a $9 million decrease in personnel-related costs, (2) a $10 million decrease in facility-related costs, and (3) a $9 million decrease in contracted services due to fewer frontline title releases during fiscal year 2015 than during fiscal year 2014.
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related expenses of executive and administrative staff, corporate functions such as finance, legal, human resources, and information technology ("it"), related overhead costs, fees for professional services such as legal and accounting, and allowances for doubtful accounts.

during fiscal year 2015, acquisition-related contingent consideration credits decreased by $32 million, or 91 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily resulting from changes in the fair market value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration of our popcap acquisition during fiscal year 2014. the popcap earn-out expired on december 31, 2013. no payments were made under this earn-out.
income taxes provision for (benefit from) income taxes for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was as follows (in millions):
our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 was a tax expense of 5.4 percent. the fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35.0 percent primarily due to the utilization of u.s. deferred tax assets, which were subject to a valuation allowance, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation deductions allocated directly to contributed capital, and non-u.s. profits subject to a reduced or zero tax rates. the provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2015 differs from the benefit from income taxes for fiscal year 2014 primarily due to benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and the resolution of examinations by taxing authorities recorded in fiscal year 2014.
our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2014 differs from the statutory rate of 35.0 percent as a result of the utilization of u.s. deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance and tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and the resolution of examinations by taxing authorities.
our effective income tax rates for fiscal year 2016 and future periods will depend on a variety of factors, including changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance, changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions, changes in our international structure, changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets, changes in the geographic mix of income, changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities, applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audit and other matters, and variations in our annual pre-tax income or loss. we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our pre-tax consolidated income or loss. as a result, in absolute dollar terms, our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pre-tax income or loss than at higher levels. in addition, at lower levels of pre-tax income or loss, our effective tax rate will be more volatile.
certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law have not been considered as a source of future taxable income that is available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets.
historically, we have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and, accordingly, no u.s. taxes have been provided thereon. we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states.
net revenue for fiscal year 2014, net revenue was $3,575 million and decreased $222 million, or 6 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2013. this decrease was driven by a $745 million decrease in revenue primarily from the mass effect, madden nfl, medal of honor, the sims, and fifa street franchises. this decrease was partially offset by a $523 million increase in revenue primarily from the battlefield, simcity, crysis franchises, and the simpsons: tapped out.

our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2014 was a tax benefit of 14.3%. the fiscal year 2014 effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35.0 percent as a result of the utilization of u.s. deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance and tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and the resolution of examinations by taxing authorities.
our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2013 differs from the statutory rate of 35.0 percent primarily due to the u.s. losses for which no benefit is recognized and non-deductible stock-based compensation, offset by non-u.s. profits subject to reduced or zero tax rates and the nontaxable change in the estimated fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration.
certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law have not been considered as a source of future taxable income that is available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets.
the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 (the "act") was signed into law on january 2, 2013. the act contains a number of provisions including, most notably, an extension of the research tax credit through december 31, 2013. the act did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 due to the effect of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets.

in may 2014, a special committee of our board of directors, on behalf of the full board of directors, authorized a two-year program to repurchase up to $750 million of our common stock. we repurchased approximately 8 million shares under this program during the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015 for approximately $337 million.
in may 2015, our board of directors authorized a new program to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock. this new stock repurchase program, which expires on may 31, 2017, supersedes and replaces the stock repurchase authorization approved in may 2014. under this program, we may purchase stock in the open market or through privately-negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws, including pursuant to pre-arranged stock trading plans. the timing and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price, capital availability, regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions. we are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares under this program and it may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. we continue to actively repurchase shares.

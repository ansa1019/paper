item 7- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future. forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and our results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements as a result of many known and unknown factors, including but not limited to those discussed in "item 1a - risk factors" of this report. see "cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements" located above "item 1 - business."
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with "item 6 - selected financial data" and "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data" appearing elsewhere in this annual report.
general we are one of the largest worldwide providers of payment solutions for merchants, value-added resellers, enterprise software providers, financial institutions, government agencies, multi-national corporations and independent sales organizations ("isos") located throughout north america, europe and the asia-pacific region and in brazil. we provide payment and digital commerce solutions and operate in two business segments, north america merchant services and international merchant services. we were incorporated in georgia as global payments inc. in september 2000 and spun-off from our former parent company on january 31, 2001. including our time as part of our former parent company, we have been in the payments business since 1967. global payments inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to collectively as "global payments," the "company," "we," "our" or "us," unless the context requires otherwise.
our north america merchant services and international merchant services segments target customers in many vertical industries including financial services, gaming, government, health care, professional services, restaurants, retail, universities, nonprofit organizations and utilities.
our offerings enable merchants to accept check, card, electronic and digital-based payments at the point of sale. our primary business model provides payment products and services directly to merchants as our end customers. we also provide similar products and services to financial institutions and a limited number of isos that, in turn, resell our products and services, in which case the financial institutions and select isos are our end customers. these particular services are marketed in the united states, canada and parts of europe.
the majority of merchant services revenue is generated on services priced as a percentage of transaction value or a specified fee per transaction, depending on card type. we also charge other fees based on specific services that are unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value. revenue from credit cards and signature debit cards is generally based on a percentage of transaction value along with other related fees, while revenue from pin-based debit cards is typically based on a fee per transaction.
our products and services are marketed through a variety of sales channels that include a direct sales force, trade associations, integrated payment technology, agent and enterprise software providers and var referral arrangements, isos, as well as proprietary telesales groups. we seek to leverage the continued shift to electronic payments by expanding market share in our existing markets through our distribution channels or through acquisitions in north america, the asia-pacific region and europe, and investing in and leveraging technology and people, thereby maximizing shareholder value. we also seek to enter new markets through acquisitions in europe and the asia-pacific and latin america regions.
our business does not have pronounced seasonality in which more than 30% of our revenues occur in one fiscal quarter. however, each geographic channel has somewhat higher and lower quarters given the nature of the portfolio. while there is some variation in seasonality across markets, the first and fourth quarters are generally the strongest, and the third quarter tends to be the weakest due to lower volumes processed in the months of january and february.
executive overview in fiscal 2014, revenues increased 7.5% to $2,554.2 million from $2,375.9 million in fiscal 2013, reflecting growth in all of our markets.
consolidated operating income was $405.5 million for fiscal 2014, compared to $357.2 million for fiscal 2013. consolidated operating income includes a processing system intrusion credit of $7.0 million for fiscal 2014 and a charge of $36.8 million for fiscal 2013. net income attributable to global payments increased $29.2 million, or 13.5%, to $245.3 million in fiscal 2014 from $216.1 million in the prior year, resulting in a $0.61 increase in diluted earnings per share to $3.37 in fiscal 2014 from $2.76 in fiscal 2013.
north america merchant services segment revenue increased $103.3 million, or 6.1%, to $1,809.0 million in fiscal 2014 from $1,705.7 million in fiscal 2013. north america merchant services segment operating income increased to $272.3 million in fiscal 2014 from $258.9 million in fiscal 2013, with operating margins of 15.0% and 15.2% for fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. the growth in the north america merchant services segment is primarily due to growth in our u.s. direct channels, including the addition of recently acquired paypros, and growth in canada, which was partially offset by the impact of changes in exchange rates.
international merchant services segment revenue increased $75.0 million, or 11.2%, to $745.2 million in fiscal 2014 from $670.2 million in fiscal 2013. international merchant services operating income also increased to $240.2 million in fiscal 2014 from $211.2 million in fiscal 2013, with operating margins of 32.2% and 31.5% for fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. the growth in the international merchant services segment is due to growth across our european markets and in the asia-pacific region.
on february 28, 2014, we closed a five-year senior unsecured $1,250.0 million term loan and $1,000.0 million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions. the proceeds from the term loan were used to repay the outstanding balance of the previously existing term loan and credit facilities and to partially fund the acquisition of payment processing, inc. ("paypros") on march 4, 2014. we have used and will continue to use the remaining capacity to support strategic growth initiatives, including acquisitions and ongoing share repurchases.
on march 4, 2014, we completed the acquisition of paypros for $420.0 million in cash plus $7.7 million in cash for working capital, subject to adjustment based on a final determination of working capital. we funded the acquisition with a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from our new debt facilities discussed above. paypros, based in california, is a provider of fully-integrated payment solutions for small-to-medium sized merchants in the united states.  paypros delivers its products and services through a network of technology-based enterprise software partners to vertical markets that are complementary to the markets served by accelerated payment technologies ("apt"), which we acquired on october 1, 2012. see note 4 - business and intangible asset acquisitions and joint ventures in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
results of operations revenues we derive our revenues from four primary sources: charges based on volumes and fees for services; charges based on transaction quantity; service fees; and equipment sales and rentals. revenues generated by these areas depend upon a number of factors, such as demand for and price of our services, the technological competitiveness of our product offerings, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry and general economic conditions.
operating expenses cost of service cost of service consists primarily of the following costs: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to operations and technology-related personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement functions; assessments and other fees paid to card networks; transaction processing systems, including third-party services; network telecommunications capability; depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities performing these functions; amortization of intangible assets and provisions for operating losses.
sales, general and administrative expenses sales, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel; non-revenue producing customer support functions and administrative employees and management; commissions paid to isos, independent contractors, and other third parties; advertising costs; other selling expenses; share-based compensation expense and occupancy of leased space directly related to these functions.
processing system intrusion in march 2012, we identified and self-reported unauthorized access into a limited portion of our north america card processing system and potential unauthorized access to servers containing personal information collected from u.s. merchants who applied for processing services. as a result of this event, we incurred approximately $114.2 million of cumulative expenses, net of insurance recoveries, relating to the incident (including a credit of $7.0 million in fiscal 2014 and a charge of $36.8 million and $84.4 million in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively), and certain card networks temporarily removed us from their lists of pci dss compliant service providers. after remediating our processes and systems, we returned to the lists of pci dss compliant service providers in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. the impact on revenue of terminations that we can confirm related to our temporary removal from the lists was immaterial. also, the impact on revenue of merchants, sales partners or other third parties who have failed to renew, terminated negotiations or informed us they are not considering us at all, where we can confirm it is due to our removal from the lists, was immaterial. we currently maintain first- and third-party insurance coverage that may cover certain aspects of cyber risks. however, in the event of a future system intrusion, we cannot provide any assurances that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover our losses.
operating income and operating margin for the purpose of discussing segment operations, we refer to operating income as calculated by subtracting segment direct expenses from segment revenue. overhead and shared expenses, including share-based compensation, are not allocated to segment operations; they are reported in the caption "corporate." similarly, references to operating margin regarding segment operations mean segment operating income divided by segment revenue. we also consider costs associated with the processing system intrusion to be a corporate expense.
the following table shows key selected financial data for the fiscal years ended may 31, 2014 and 2013, this data as a percentage of total revenues, and the changes between fiscal years in dollars and as a percentage of fiscal 2013.

operating margin for segments:
(2) includes a processing system intrusion credit of $7.0 million in fiscal 2014 and a charge of $36.8 million in fiscal 2013.
revenues for fiscal 2014, revenues increased 7.5% to $2,554.2 million compared to the prior year, reflecting growth in all of our markets. our revenues were affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. for the year ended may 31, 2014, currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our revenues by $10.8 million compared to the prior year, calculated by converting our fiscal 2014 actual revenues at fiscal 2013 rates.
north america merchant services segment. for fiscal 2014, revenue from our north america merchant services segment increased 6.1% to $1,809.0 million compared to the prior year. north america revenue growth was driven by our u.s. direct channels, including recently acquired paypros, as well as our iso channels and growth in canada.
we grow our u.s. revenue primarily by adding small and mid-market merchants in diversified vertical markets. for fiscal 2014, our u.s. credit and debit card processed transactions grew 6.6% compared to the prior year, excluding the impact of paypros.
for fiscal 2014, our canadian revenue increased 3.0% to $320.3 million primarily due to credit card transaction growth and assessment-based pricing changes, partially offset by the impact of changes in exchange rates. for fiscal 2014, our total canadian transactions grew 2.5% compared to the prior year, including 4.6% growth in credit card transactions.
in direct merchant acquiring, we provide processing services to merchants and, generally through our relationship with a member sponsor, fund settlement. we market our direct merchant services through a variety of channels, including our iso channel, whereby the iso receives a share of the merchant profitability in the form of a monthly residual payment. revenue for direct merchant services is recognized in the amount of merchant billing net of interchange, and any residual payments to the iso are reflected as a component of selling, general and administrative expense.
in indirect merchant acquiring, the partner, typically a financial institution or an iso, is our customer. we provide processing services to the indirect customer's merchants, but do not provide sponsorship or funds settlement. we bill the indirect customer fees for transactions and various other services, which is recognized as revenue.
international merchant services segment. for fiscal 2014, international merchant services revenue increased 11.2% to $745.2 million compared to the prior year. our europe merchant services revenue for fiscal 2014 increased 12.4% to $587.5 million compared to the prior year driven primarily by transaction growth in all markets as well as growth in our e-commerce services. asia-pacific merchant services revenue for fiscal 2014 increased 6.9% to $157.8 million compared to the prior year due largely to pricing increases and new assessments.
operating expenses cost of service. cost of service increased 10.5% during fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in the variable costs associated with revenue growth and an increase in amortization expense associated with our acquisitions of apt and paypros. as a percentage of revenue, cost of service increased to 37.3% for fiscal year 2014 from 36.3% in the prior year.
sales, general and administrative expenses. sales, general and administrative expenses increased 7.5% during fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in commission payments to isos, incremental costs related to our acquisitions of apt and paypros, acceleration of equity awards and other costs associated with the retirement of our former chairman and chief executive officer and charges related to employee termination benefits. as a percentage of revenues, sales, general and administrative expenses remained unchanged at 47.1% for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013.
processing system intrusion. during fiscal 2014, we recorded a credit of $7.0 million related to insurance recoveries associated with our processing system intrusion, bringing our total insurance recoveries recognized to date to $27.0 million. we do not expect any additional recoveries. during fiscal 2013, we recorded a $36.8 million charge related to the incident. since our identification of the intrusion in march 2012, we have incurred approximately $114.2 million of cumulative expenses, net of insurance recoveries, relating to the incident.
operating income and operating margin for segments north america merchant services segment. operating income in north america merchant services segment increased 5.2% to $272.3 million for fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year. the increase in operating income was primarily due to the increases in transactions and volume in our u.s. direct channels as well as growth in canada. this increase was partially offset by amortization and other incremental costs associated with our acquisitions of apt and paypros and foreign currency translation in canada. the operating margin was 15.0% and 15.2% for the fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively.
international merchant services segment. operating income in international merchant services segment increased 13.7% to $240.2 million for fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year. the increase in operating income was driven primarily by increased transactions and volume in europe and the asia-pacific region as well as pricing increases in the asia-pacific region. the operating margin was 32.2% and 31.5% for the fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively.
corporate. our corporate expenses decreased 5.3% to $106.9 million for fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year primarily due a decrease in one-time costs associated with the processing system intrusion partially offset by higher data security expenses and
share-based compensation expense. corporate operating expenses includes a processing system intrusion credit of $7.0 million for fiscal 2014 and a charge of $36.8 million for fiscal 2013.
operating income during fiscal 2014, our consolidated operating income increased 13.5% to $405.5 million from $357.2 million in the prior year. the increase was primarily due to revenue growth in our north america and international merchant services segments offset by (i) higher variable costs of services associated with revenue growth, (ii) higher amortization and other incremental costs associated with acquisitions, (iii) higher data security expenses and (iv) acceleration of equity awards and other costs associated with the retirement of our former chairman and chief executive officer, and charges related to employee termination benefits. operating income also reflects the adjustments from the processing system intrusion credit of $7.0 million and charge of $36.8 million for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively.
other income/expense, net other expense, net, increased to $28.1 million for fiscal 2014 compared to $22.9 million in the prior year. the increase is primarily due to a $8.2 million increase in interest expense associated with debt and the loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.1 million that we recorded in connection with the refinancing of our term loan and revolving credit facility; offset by a $5.1 million reduction in the amount of dividends paid to hsbc asia related to a redeemable noncontrolling interest that hsbc asia held in global payments asia-pacific. such dividends are reflected as interest expense in our consolidated statements of income in accordance with the provisions of asc 480. please see note 4 - business and intangible asset acquisition and joint ventures - redeemable noncontrolling interest acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rates were 28.5% and 28.6% for the years ended may 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the effective tax rates for the years ended may 31, 2014 and 2013 reflect adjustments to our u.k. deferred tax asset due to corporate tax rate reductions in the united kingdom of 3% and 2%, respectively. our effective tax rates differ from u.s. statutory rates due to domestic and international tax planning initiatives and income generated in lower tax jurisdictions due to international expansion.
the following table shows key selected financial data for the fiscal years ended may 31, 2013 and 2012, this data as a percentage of total revenues, and the changes between fiscal years in dollars and as a percentage of fiscal 2012.

(2) includes processing system intrusion charges of $36.8 million and $84.4 million in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively.
revenues for fiscal 2013, revenues increased 7.8% to $2,375.9 million compared to the prior year. this growth was primarily driven by our u.s. iso channel, growth from our direct sales channels and gaming business, and growth in europe; partially offset by market-based pricing compression in canada.
north america merchant services segment. for fiscal 2013, revenue from our north america merchant services segment increased 8.8% compared to $1,705.7 million. north america revenue growth was driven by our u.s. iso channel, strong growth from our direct sales channels, gaming business and reduced interchange expense due to recently enacted legislation.
in fiscal 2013, we grew our u.s. revenue primarily by adding small and mid-market merchants in diversified vertical markets, largely through our iso channel. for fiscal 2013, our u.s. direct credit and debit card processed transactions grew 11.2% compared to the prior year. increased spreads offset the impact of a lower average ticket price, which decreased by 0.9% in fiscal 2013. this
for fiscal 2013, our canadian revenue decreased 6.4% to $311.0 million while our credit and debit card processed transactions grew 3.2% compared to the prior year. the decrease in revenue was due to ongoing market-based pricing compression.
international merchant services segment. for fiscal 2013, international merchant services revenue increased 5.3% to $670.2 million compared to the prior year. our europe merchant services revenue for fiscal 2013 increased 6.8% to $522.6 million compared to the prior year, driven primarily by strong transaction growth in all markets. asia-pacific merchant services revenue of $147.7 million was flat for fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year resulting from a slight decrease of 0.8% in the number of credit and debit card processed transactions.
operating expenses cost of service. cost of service increased 9.9% during fiscal 2013, compared to the prior year primarily driven by revenue growth. as a percentage of revenue, cost of service increased to 36.3% for fiscal year 2013 from 35.6% in the prior year.
sales, general and administrative expenses. sales, general and administrative expenses increased 9.0% for fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year. in addition, as a percentage of revenues, sales, general and administrative expenses increased to 47.1% for fiscal 2013 from 46.6% in the prior year. these increases were primarily due to an increase in commission payments to isos and costs associated with our start up operations in brazil. these increases were somewhat offset by the elimination of iso commission payments previously made to apt as a result of our acquisition of apt on october 1, 2012.
processing system intrusion. during the fiscal year ended may 31, 2013, we recorded $36.8 million of expense associated with the processing system intrusion described above, bringing the life-to-date total expense to $121.2 million as of may 31, 2013. of this life-to-date expense, $105.5 million represented costs incurred through may 31, 2013 for professional fees and other costs associated with the investigation and remediation, incentive payments to certain business partners and costs associated with credit monitoring and identity protection insurance. an additional $35.7 million represented total fraud losses, fines and other charges that have been imposed upon us by the card networks. we also recorded $20.0 million of insurance recoveries. during fiscal 2013, we reduced our accrual for fraud losses, fines and other charges by $31.8 million. we based our initial estimate of fraud losses, fines and other charges on our understanding of the rules and operating regulations published by the networks and preliminary communications with the networks. we subsequently reached resolution with and made payments to the networks, resulting in charges that were less than our initial estimates. the primary difference between our initial estimates and the final charges relates to lower fraud related costs attributed to this event than previously expected. as of may 31, 2013, we had received $20.0 million in insurance recoveries related to the intrusion.
operating income and operating margin for segments north america merchant services segment. operating income in the north america merchant services segment decreased 8.0% for fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year. the decrease in operating income was primarily due to market-based pricing compression in canada. the operating margin was 15.2% and 17.9% for the fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively. the decrease in operating margin was primarily driven by the iso channel, including the impact of the durbin amendment, canadian spread compression and costs associated with our start up operation in brazil. these increases were somewhat offset by the elimination of iso commission payments previously made to apt as a result of our acquisition of apt on october 1, 2012. the iso channel generally has a dilutive effect on our operating margin compared to our other channels due to the ongoing commission payments to the isos.
effective october 1, 2011, the debit interchange legislation capped the amount of interchange that card issuers may charge on transactions. our interchange expenses decreased as a result of this. we recognize revenue net of interchange expense; therefore, our revenues increased as a result of lower interchange expense with a resulting increase in operating income as well. increased revenues came primarily through our iso channel, where reduced interchange fees led to higher revenues and a dollar-for-dollar increase in iso commission expense, with an associated reduction in our operating margin.
international merchant services segment. operating income in the international merchant services segment increased 7.7% to $211.2 million for fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year. the operating margin was 31.5% and 30.8% for the fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase in operating margin in our international merchant services segment was due to strong results in europe, partially offset by last year's marketing fee true-up in spain, whereby caixabank compensated us for favorable pricing to certain caixabank customers during the initial phase of our marketing alliance agreement.
corporate. our corporate costs decreased 33.6% to $112.9 million for fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year. this decrease was primarily due to lower costs associated with the processing system intrusion and charges related to two contractual disputes in fiscal 2012.
operating income during fiscal 2013, our consolidated operating income increased $49.9 million to $357.2 million from $307.3 million in the prior year. the increase in our consolidated operating income was primarily due to solid financial results in north america and europe and lower costs associated with the processing system intrusion in fiscal 2013 compared to 2012.
other income/expense, net other expense, net, increased to $22.9 million for fiscal 2013 compared to $6.9 million in the prior year period. the increase was due to higher debt balances as well as an $8.4 million distribution to hsbc asia in fiscal 2013. this distribution was characterized as interest expense in accordance with the provisions of asc 480. please see note 4 - business and intangible asset acquisition and joint ventures - redeemable noncontrolling interest acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rates were 28.6% and 27.6% for the years ended may 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the effective tax rates for the years ended may 31, 2013 and 2012 reflect adjustments to our u.k. deferred tax asset due to enacted corporate tax rate reductions in the united kingdom of 2% in each year. our effective tax rates differ from u.s. statutory rates due to domestic and international tax planning initiatives and the increasing amount of income being generated in lower tax jurisdictions due to international expansion.
noncontrolling interests, net of tax noncontrolling interests, net of tax decreased to $22.6 million from $29.4 million for the fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively. this decrease was primarily due to the fact that we stopped attributing income to the gpap redeemable noncontrolling interest subsequent to july 26, 2012, the date of our agreement to purchase hsbc asia's interest.
liquidity and capital resources a significant portion of our liquidity comes from operating cash flows. cash flow from operations is used to make planned capital investments in our business, to pursue acquisitions that meet our corporate objectives, to pay dividends, and to pay down debt and repurchase shares of our common stock at the discretion of our board of directors. accumulated cash balances are invested in high quality and marketable short-term instruments.
our capital plan objectives are to support the company's operational needs and strategic plan for long-term growth while maintaining a low cost of capital. lines of credit are used in certain of our markets to fund settlement and, along with other bank financing, to fund acquisitions. we regularly evaluate our liquidity and capital position relative to cash requirements, and we may elect to raise additional funds in the future, either through the issuance of debt, equity or otherwise.
at may 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $581.9 million. of this amount, we consider $304.3 million to be available cash. our available cash balance includes $174.7 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are considered permanently reinvested for u.s. tax purposes. these cash balances reflect our capital investments in these subsidiaries and the accumulation of cash flows generated by each subsidiary's operations, net of cash flows used to service debt locally and fund
non-u.s. acquisitions. we believe that we are able to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity for our domestic operations and commitments without repatriation of the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries. if we were to repatriate some or all of the cash held by such foreign subsidiaries, we do not believe that the associated income tax liabilities would have a significant impact on our liquidity.
available cash excludes settlement related and merchant reserve cash balances. settlement related cash balances represent funds that we hold on behalf of our member sponsors when the incoming amount from the card networks precedes the member sponsors' funding obligation to the merchant. settlement related cash balances are not restricted; however, these funds are generally paid out in satisfaction of settlement processing obligations the following day. merchant reserve cash balances represent funds collected from our merchants that serve as collateral to minimize contingent liabilities associated with any losses that may occur under the merchant agreement ("merchant reserves"). at may 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents included $124.7 million related to merchant reserves. while this cash is not restricted in its use, we believe that designating this cash to collateralize merchant reserves strengthens our fiduciary standing with our member sponsors and is in accordance with the guidelines set by the card networks.
operating activities provided net cash of $194.1 million during fiscal 2014 compared to net cash of $240.5 million during the prior year. the decrease in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to the change in net settlement processing assets and obligations of $137.4 million, which is generally driven by the timing of month end cut-off, offset by an increase in operating income and favorable changes in prepaid expenses and accrued liabilities resulting from the absence in fiscal 2014 of payments associated with the processing system intrusion.
net cash used in investing activities decreased from $528.6 million in the prior year to $501.7 million in fiscal 2014, primarily due to a reduction in capital expenditures for data center infrastructure and our authorization platform.
for fiscal 2014, financing activities provided net cash of $218.9 million compared to $183.5 million in the prior year. on february 28, 2014, we closed a five-year senior unsecured $1,250.0 million term loan facility, paid off previously existing debt of 902.5 million and paid fees and expenses of 6.0 million. in connection with the debt refinancing, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured $1,000.0 million revolving credit facility under which we borrowed $140.0 million during the remainder of fiscal 2014. in addition, we made net borrowings of $252.7 million on short-term lines of credit used to fund settlement-related activities, and we spent $447.3 million to repurchase shares of our common stock.
in the prior year, we borrowed $700.0 million under a five-year unsecured term loan facility of which we repaid $52.5 million during fiscal 2013. in addition, we made net payments of $27.9 million on short-term lines of credit used to fund settlement-related activities. finally, we invested $242.0 million to purchase hsbc asia's 44% interest in gpap and $175.3 million to repurchase shares of our common stock during fiscal 2013.
we believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our lines of credit described below, together with future cash flows from operations, are sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future. during fiscal 2015, we expect capital expenditures to approximate $95.0 million.
long-term debt and credit facilities as of may 31, 2014 and 2013, outstanding debt consisted of the following:
lines of credit:                                                      (in thousands)
corporate credit facility - long-term        $140,000                  $309,955
short-term lines of credit                    440,128                   187,461
total lines of credit                         580,128                   497,416
maturity requirements on outstanding debt by fiscal years are as follows (in thousands):
on february 28, 2014, we entered into an amended and restated term loan agreement ("term loan") and an amended and restated credit agreement ("corporate credit facility") with a syndicate of financial institutions. the term loan and the corporate credit facility amended and restated the term loan agreement dated september 28, 2012 and the credit agreement dated december 7, 2010, respectively.
the term loan is a five-year senior unsecured $1,250.0 million term loan. we used proceeds from the term loan to partially fund our acquisition of paypros on march 4, 2014 and to repay the outstanding balances on our previously existing revolving credit facility and our previously existing term loan.
the term loan expires february 28, 2019 and bears interest, at our election, at either libor or a base rate, in each case plus a leverage-based margin. as of may 31, 2014, the interest rate on the term loan was 1.62%. commencing in may 2015 and ending in november 2018, the term loan has scheduled quarterly principal payments of 1.25%, increasing up to 2.50%. at maturity, 27.50% of the term loan will have been repaid through scheduled amortization and the remaining principal balance will be due. with notice, the term loan may be voluntarily prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, without penalty. as of may 31, 2014, the outstanding balance of the term loan was $1,250.0 million.
the corporate credit facility is a five-year senior unsecured revolving $1,000.0 million revolving credit facility. the corporate credit facility expires february 28, 2019 and bears interest, at our election, at either libor or a base rate, in each case plus a leverage-based margin. borrowing under the corporate credit facility is available in various currencies. as of may 31, 2014, the outstanding balance of the corporate credit facility was $140.0 million, and the interest rate was 1.6%. the corporate credit facility is available for general corporate purposes.
the corporate credit facility allows us to issue standby letters of credit of up to $100.0 million in the aggregate. outstanding letters of credit under the corporate credit facility reduce the amount of borrowings available to us. at may 31, 2014, we had standby
letters of credit of $8.1 million. the total available incremental borrowings under our corporate credit facility at may 31, 2014 was $851.9 million. the corporate credit facility is included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets because we are not contractually obligated to make repayments in the next twelve months.
upon closing of the term loan and the corporate credit facility, which occurred on february 28, 2014, we repaid the outstanding balance of $612.5 million on our previously existing term loan and the outstanding balance of $290.0 million on our previously existing revolving credit facility together with accrued interest and fees on each. in connection with the debt refinancing, we recorded a loss of $2.1 million, representing the write off of debt issuance costs associated with the previously existing term loan. we reported this loss in interest and other expense in our consolidated statements of income for the fiscal year ended may 31, 2014. we incurred fees and expenses associated with these new arrangements of approximately $6.0 million, which was capitalized as debt issuance costs. debt issuance costs are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet at may 31, 2014 and are being amortized over the term of these new arrangements.
the agreements contain customary affirmative and restrictive covenants, including, among others, financial covenants based on our leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. please see "compliance with covenants" below. each of the agreements includes customary events of default, the occurrence of which, following any applicable cure period, would permit lenders to, among other things, declare the principal, accrued interest and other obligations to be immediately due and payable.
short-term lines of credit we have short-term lines of credit with banks in the united states and canada as well as several countries in europe and asia in which we do business. the short-term lines of credit, which are primarily used to fund settlement, generally have variable short-term interest rates and are subject to annual review. the credit facilities are generally denominated in local currency but may, in some cases, facilitate borrowings in multiple currencies. for certain of our lines of credit, the line of credit balance is reduced by the amount of cash we have on deposit in specific accounts with the lender when determining compliance with the credit limit. accordingly, the line of credit balance may exceed the stated credit limit at any given point in time, when in fact the combined position is less than the credit limit.
as of may 31, 2014 and may 31, 2013, respectively, we had $440.1 million and $187.5 million outstanding under these short-term lines of credit, with additional borrowing capacity as of may 31, 2014 of $818.5 million to fund settlement. during the year ended may 31, 2014, the maximum and average borrowings under our lines of credit were $1,000.5 million and $551.6 million, respectively. the weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings was 1.7% and 2.1% at may 31, 2014 and may 31, 2013, respectively. our maximum borrowed amount was greater than our average and period end borrowings due to the timing of settlement funding.
notes payable united card services, our subsidiary in the russian federation, had notes payable with a total outstanding balance of approximately $3.7 million at may 31, 2014. these notes had fixed annual interest rates of 8.5% with maturity dates ranging from june 2014 through november 2018.
compliance with covenants there are certain financial and non-financial covenants contained in our various credit facilities and term loan. our term loan and corporate credit facility agreements include financial covenants requiring (i) a leverage ratio no greater than 3.50 to 1.00 and (ii) a fixed charge coverage ratio no less than 2.50 to 1.00. we complied with all applicable covenants as of and for the year ended may 31, 2014.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interest, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or other obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk support other than the guarantee products described under "critical accounting estimates" below.
bin/ica agreements we have entered into sponsorship or depository and processing agreements with certain banks. these agreements allow us to use the banks' identification numbers, referred to as bank identification number ("bin") for visa transactions and interbank card association ("ica") number for mastercard transactions, to clear credit card transactions through visa and mastercard. certain of such agreements contain financial covenants, and we were in compliance with all such covenants as of may 31, 2014.
commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of may 31, 2014:
the table above excludes other obligations that we may have, such as employee benefit plan obligations, unrecognized tax benefits, and other current and long-term liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. at this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of these payments; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. we do not have any material purchase commitments as of may 31, 2014.
critical accounting policies in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. some of these accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates. we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. in many instances, however, we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and, in other instances, changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period, with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. we refer to accounting estimates of this type as "critical accounting estimates." the critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements.
accounting estimates necessarily require subjective determinations about future events and conditions. therefore, the following descriptions of critical accounting estimates are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward-looking statements. you should read the following in conjunction with note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the risk factors contained in "item 1a - risk factors" of this annual report.
reserve for operating losses as a part of our direct merchant credit card and debit card processing services and check guarantee services, we experience merchant losses and check guarantee losses, which we collectively refer to as "operating losses." merchant losses occur when we are unable to collect amounts from merchant customers for any charges properly reversed by the issuing bank. check guarantee losses occur when we are unable to collect the full amount of a guaranteed check from the checkwriter. please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further explanation of these operating losses.
we process credit card transactions for direct merchants and recognize revenue based on a percentage of the gross amount charged. our direct merchant customers have the liability for any charges properly reversed by the issuing bank. in the event,
however, that we are not able to collect such amount from the merchants, due to merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other reason, we may be liable for any such reversed charges. we require cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit and other types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability, and we also utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk. we have, however, historically experienced losses due to merchant defaults.
we record reserves for our estimated liability for operating losses. this estimate of losses is comprised of estimated known losses and estimated incurred but not reported losses. estimated known losses arise from specific instances of, for example, merchant bankruptcies, closures or fraud of which we are aware at the balance sheet date, but for which the ultimate amount of associated loss will not be determined until after the balance sheet date. estimated known loss accruals are recorded when it is probable that we have incurred a loss and the loss is reasonably estimable. estimated known losses are calculated at the merchant level based on chargebacks received to date, processed volume, and historical chargeback ratios. the estimate is reduced for any collateral that we hold. accruals for estimated known losses are evaluated periodically and adjusted as appropriate based on actual loss experience. incurred but not reported losses result from transactions that we process before the balance sheet date for which we have not yet received chargeback notification. we estimate incurred but not reported losses by applying historical loss ratios to our direct merchant credit card and signature debit card sales volumes processed, or processed volume. historically, this estimation process has been materially accurate.
for the years ended may 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, our processed volume was $201.2 billion, $192.8 billion, and $180.7 billion, respectively. for these same periods, we recorded provisions for merchant losses of $8.7 million, $9.5 million, and $8.8 million, respectively. as a percentage of processed volume, these charges were 0.0043%, 0.0049%, and 0.0049%, respectively, during the above periods. for these same years, we experienced actual losses of $9.3 million, $9.5 million, and $9.6 million, respectively. we believe that our estimation process has been materially accurate on a historical basis. a 10% increase or decrease in our provision for merchant losses as a percentage of processed volume for the year ended may 31, 2014 would have resulted in a decrease or increase in net income of $0.6 million. further, if our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee volume for our fiscal 2014 had equaled our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee volume of 0.0049% for the same prior year period, our net income would have decreased by $0.9 million. as of may 31, 2014 and 2013, $1.7 million and $2.3 million respectively has been recorded for guarantees associated with merchant card processing and are included in settlement processing obligations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
in our check guarantee service offering, we charge our merchants a percentage of the gross amount of the check and guarantee payment of the check to the merchant in the event the check is not honored by the checkwriter's bank. we have the right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter but have not historically recovered 100% of the guaranteed checks. our check guarantee loss reserve is comprised of estimated losses on returned checks and estimated incurred but not reported losses.  we estimate the loss on returned checks by applying historical collection rates to our claims receivable balance.  we estimate incurred but not reported losses by applying historical loss ratios to the face value of our guaranteed checks.  for each of the years ended may 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, we guaranteed total check face values of $2.6 billion. for those same periods, we recorded provisions for check guarantee losses of $11.9 million, $11.7 million, and $13.4 million, respectively. as a percentage of the total guaranteed check face value, these charges were 0.46%, 0.44%, and 0.51%, respectively. for these same years, we experienced actual losses of $12.1 million, $12.0 million, and $13.8 million, respectively. we believe that our estimation process has been materially accurate on a historical basis. a 10% increase or decrease in our percentage assumption for the year ended may 31, 2014 would have resulted in a decrease or increase in net income of $0.8 million. further, if our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee volume for our fiscal 2014 had equaled our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee volume of 0.44% for the same prior year period, our net income would have increased by $0.2 million. as of may 31, 2014 and 2013, we had a check guarantee reserve of $3.0 million and $3.1 million, respectively, which is included in claims receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
we derive our projected loss rate assumptions primarily based on a rolling six to twelve month analysis of historic loss activity. these assumptions, however, bear the risk of change, which may occur as a result of several qualitative factors. for merchant losses, these factors include the following: a change in the creditworthiness of our merchant customers; a change in the levels of credit card fraud affecting our merchant customers; and a change in the effectiveness of our internal credit, risk management, and collection departments. for check guarantee losses, these factors include a change in the levels of dishonored consumer checks presented to our guarantee service merchant customers and a change in the effectiveness of our internal check guarantee procedures, customer acceptance and retention policies, or collection protocols. application of our percentage assumptions involve uncertainty regarding changes in any of the factors above, especially those that are outside of our control, such as the financial health of the economies in
the united states, canada, the united kingdom, spain, the asia-pacific region and the russian federation at a regional or national level and the related impact on our customers.
goodwill and long-lived asset valuations goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. we test goodwill for impairment annually as of january 1st and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net carrying value. we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative testing for impairment is necessary. the option of whether or not to perform a qualitative assessment is made from year-to-year and can vary by reporting unit.
as of january 1, 2014, we elected to apply the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment guidance in asc 350-20, goodwill, for each of our reporting units. factors we consider in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance of our reporting units, events or changes affecting the composition or carrying value of the net assets of our reporting units, sustained decrease in our share price, and other relevant entity specific events. if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying value, a two-step quantitative test is required. in the first step, the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, is compared to its fair value. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and step two must be performed. step two measures the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit (including unrecognized intangibles) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. the excess of the fair value over the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the goodwill. the excess of the carrying amount over the implied fair value of the goodwill is the impairment loss.
we have six reporting units: north america merchant services, u.k. merchant services, asia-pacific merchant services, central and eastern europe merchant services, russia merchant services and spain merchant services. based on our annual assessment as of january 1, 2014, we determined on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair values of the reporting units were not more likely than not less than their respective carrying values; and therefore, a two-step quantitative test was not required. we believe that the fair values of our reporting units are substantially in excess of their carrying values.
our goodwill impairment testing involves the use of estimates and the exercise of judgment on the part of management. our assessment of the qualitative factors discussed above involves significant judgments about expected future business performance and general market conditions. significant changes in our assessment of such qualitative factors could affect our assessment of the fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.
other intangible assets primarily represent customer-related intangible assets (such as customer lists and merchant contracts), contract-based intangible assets (such as non-compete agreements, referral agreements and processing rights), acquired technology and trademarks associated with acquisitions. customer-related intangible assets, contract-based intangible assets and trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful lives of from 5 to 30 years. the useful lives for customer-related intangible assets are determined based primarily on forecasted cash flows, which include estimates for the revenues, expenses, and customer attrition associated with the assets. the useful lives of contract-based intangible assets are equal to the terms of the agreements. the useful lives of amortizable trademarks are based on our plans to phase out the trademarks in the applicable markets. acquired technology is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life.
amortization for most of our customer-related intangible assets is calculated using an accelerated method. in determining amortization expense under our accelerated method for any given period, we calculate the expected cash flows for that period that were used in determining the acquired value of the asset and divide that amount by the expected total cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. we multiply that percentage by the initial carrying value of the asset to arrive at the amortization expense for that period. if the cash flow patterns that we experience differ significantly from our initial estimates, we will adjust the amortization schedule accordingly. these cash flow patterns are derived using certain assumptions and cost allocations due to a significant amount of asset interdependencies that exist in our business. during fiscal 2014, we did not adjust the amortization schedules.
we believe that our accelerated method better approximates the distribution of cash flows generated by our acquired customer relationships. we use the straight-line method of amortization for our contract-based intangibles and amortizable trademarks.
we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of property and equipment and finite-life intangible assets may not be recoverable. when factors indicate that these long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we assess the potential impairment by determining whether the carrying value of such long-lived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. fair values are determined based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flow analysis as applicable. we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the useful lives of property and equipment and finite-life intangible assets may warrant revision. in our opinion, the carrying values of our long-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-life intangible assets, were not impaired at may 31, 2014 and 2013.
capitalization of internally developed software we develop software that is used in providing processing services to customers. capitalization of internally developed software, primarily associated with operating platforms, occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage, management authorizes the project, management commits to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended. the preliminary project stage consists of the conceptual formulation of alternatives, the evaluation of alternatives, the determination of existence of needed technology and the final selection of alternatives. costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. currently unforeseen circumstances in software development, such as a significant change in the manner in which the software is intended to be used, obsolescence or a significant reduction in revenues due to merchant attrition, could require us to implement alternative plans with respect to a particular effort, which could result in the impairment of previously capitalized software development costs. such impairment would result in a charge to income. total software capitalized at may 31, 2014 was $224.8 million. costs capitalized during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 totaled $39.1 million, $29.2 million, and $31.3 million, respectively. internally developed software has an amortization period of 5 to 10 years. internally developed software assets are placed into service when they are ready for their intended use.
as of may 31, 2014, we have placed into service $96.7 million of hardware and software associated with our authorization platform, $6.1 million of which was placed in service during fiscal 2014. the vision for this platform is to serve as a front-end operating environment for merchant processing and is intended to replace a number of legacy platforms that have higher cost structures. depreciation and amortization associated with these costs is calculated based on transactions expected to be processed over the life of the platform. we believe that this method is more representative of the platform's use than the straight-line method. we are currently processing transactions on this authorization platform in nine markets in our asia-pacific region and for a limited number of u.s. merchants. as these markets represent a small percentage of our overall transactions, depreciation and amortization related to this platform for fiscal 2014 was not significant. depreciation and amortization expense will increase as we complete migrations of other merchants to this authorization platform.
income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires management's judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. we believe our tax return positions are fully supportable; however, we establish liabilities for material tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. issues raised by a tax authority may be finally resolved at an amount different than the related liability. when facts and circumstances change (including a resolution of an issue or statute of limitations expiration), these liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes in the period of change.
judgment is required to determine whether or not some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. to the extent we determine that we will not realize the benefit of some or all of our deferred tax assets, then these deferred tax assets are adjusted through our provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made. at may 31, 2014, our consolidated balance sheet includes net deferred tax assets associated with our united kingdom business of $96.7 million. our assessment of the recoverability of these deferred tax assets is based, in part, on our projections of future business performance and viable tax planning strategies. if future business performance fails to meet projections, we may determine that some or all of these deferred tax assets
will not be realized. in the event of such a determination, we would record a valuation allowance for the amount deemed unrecoverable with a corresponding charge to the provision for income taxes.
new accounting pronouncements from time-to-time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. unless otherwise discussed, our management believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
in may 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update ("asu") 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers(topic 606)." the core principle of the asu is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. the asu requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. early application is not permitted. we are evaluating the impact of this asu on our consolidated financial statements.
in april 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-08, "presentation of financial statements (topic 205) and property, plant, and equipment (topic 360) reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity." the amendments in asu 2014-11change the requirements for reporting discontinued operations in asc 205-20. the amendments change the definition of discontinued operations by limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. the amendments require expanded disclosures for discontinued operations and are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2014. early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals (or classifications as "held for sale") that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issuance.
in july 2013, the fasb issued asu 2013-11, "presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists" ("asu 2013-11"). the amendments in asu 2013-11 require an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss ("nol") carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward except when: (1) a nol carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available as of the reporting date under the governing tax law to settle taxes that would result from the disallowance of the tax position; or (2) the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for this purpose (provided that the tax law permits a choice). if either of these conditions exists, an entity should present an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as a liability and should not net the unrecognized tax benefit with a deferred tax asset. the amendment does not affect the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions under asc 740-5. the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2013. the amendments should be applied prospectively to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date. retrospective application is permitted.
in march 2013, the fasb issued asu 2013-05, "foreign currency matters" ("asu 2013-05"). the amendments in asu 2013-05 resolve the diversity in practice about whether current literature applies to the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. in addition, the amendments in asu 2013-05 resolve the diversity in practice for the treatment of business combinations achieved in stages (sometimes also referred to as step acquisitions) involving a foreign entity. asu 2013-05 is effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2013.

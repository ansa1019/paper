item 7: managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general realty income, the monthly dividend company®, is a publicly traded real estate company with the primary business objective of generating dependable monthly cash dividends from a consistent and predictable level of cash flow from operations.  our monthly dividends are supported by the cash flow from our property portfolio. we have in-house acquisition, portfolio management, asset management, credit research, real estate research, legal, finance and accounting, information technology, and capital markets capabilities. over the past 46 years, realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and managing freestanding commercial properties that generate rental revenue under long-term net lease agreements.
realty income (nyse: o) was founded in 1969, and in 1994 was listed on the nyse.  we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or reit, requiring us to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains).
we seek to increase earnings and distributions to stockholders through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties.
·                  with an occupancy rate of 98.4%, or 4,257 properties leased and 70 properties available for lease;
·                  with over 70.7 million square feet of leasable space; and
·                  with an average leasable space per property of approximately 16,350 square feet, including approximately 11,290 square feet per retail property.
of the 4,327 properties in the portfolio, 4,308, or 99.6%, are single-tenant properties, and the remaining are multi-tenant properties. at december 31, 2014, of the 4,308 single-tenant properties, 4,238 were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant) of approximately 10.2 years.
liquidity and capital resources capital philosophy historically, we have met our long-term capital needs by issuing common stock, preferred stock and long-term unsecured notes and bonds. over the long term, we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure. however, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities. we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties. in addition, we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities. however, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us.
our primary cash obligations, for the current year and subsequent years, are included in the table of obligations, which is presented later in this section. we expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, including property acquisitions and development costs, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders, primarily through cash provided by operating activities, borrowing on our $1.5 billion credit facility and periodically through public securities offerings.
conservative capital structure we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure. therefore, we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. at december 31, 2014, our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds, term loan, mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were $4.93 billion, or approximately 30.6% of our total market capitalization of $16.11 billion.
we define our total market capitalization at december 31, 2014 as the sum of:
·                  shares of our common stock outstanding of 224,881,192, plus total common units of 816,568, multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of $47.71 per share on december 31, 2014, or $10.77 billion;
·                  outstanding borrowings of $223.0 million on our credit facility;
mortgage debt as of december 31, 2014, we had $836.0 million of mortgages payable, all of which were assumed in connection with our property acquisitions.  additionally, at december 31, 2014, we had net premiums totaling $16.6 million on these mortgages.
we expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties have declined to a level that will make it economically feasible to do so.  during 2014, we made $85.2 million of principal payments, including the repayment of six mortgages in full for $77.8 million.
term loan in january 2013, in conjunction with our acquisition of arct, we entered into a $70 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in january 2018.  borrowing under the term loan bears interest at libor, plus 1.20%.  in conjunction with this term loan, we also acquired an interest rate swap which essentially fixes our per annum interest rate on the term loan at 2.15%.
$1.5 billion acquisition credit facility we have a $1.5 billion unsecured acquisition credit facility with an initial term that expires in may 2016 and includes, at our election, a one-year extension option. under this credit facility, our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate, commonly referred to as libor, plus 1.075% with a facility commitment fee of 0.175%, for all-in drawn pricing of 1.25% over libor. the borrowing rate is not subject to an interest rate floor or ceiling. we also have other interest rate options available to us under this credit facility. our credit facility is unsecured and, accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation.
at december 31, 2014, we had a borrowing capacity of $1.28 billion available on our credit facility (subject to customary conditions to borrowing) and an outstanding balance of $223.0 million.  the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, at december 31, 2014, was 1.2% per annum.  we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility.  at december 31, 2014, we remain in compliance with these covenants. we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes. any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk. we regularly review our credit facility and may seek to extend or replace our credit facility, to the extent we deem appropriate.
we generally use our credit facility for the short-term financing of new property acquisitions. thereafter, when capital is available on acceptable terms, we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of long-term or permanent financing, which may include the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. we cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing, or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms.
in september 2014, we issued $250 million of 4.125% senior unsecured notes due october 2026, or the 2026 notes.  the price to the investors for the 2026 notes was 99.499% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 4.178% per annum.  a portion of the total net proceeds of approximately $246.4 million from this offering was used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility, and the remaining proceeds were used for other general corporate purposes and working capital, including additional property acquisitions.
in june 2014, we issued $350 million of 3.875% senior unsecured notes due july 2024, or the 2024 notes.  the price to the investors for the 2024 notes was 99.956% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 3.88% per annum.  the total net proceeds of approximately $346.7 million from this offering were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility.
cash reserves we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders, in the form of monthly cash distributions, a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties.  we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital.  at december 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $3.9 million.
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from operating activities, and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months.  we intend, however, to use permanent or long-term capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility.
acquisitions during 2014
during 2014, we invested $1.4 billion in 506 new properties and properties under development or expansion, with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 7.1%. the 506 new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in 42 states, will contain approximately 9.8 million leasable square feet, and are 100% leased with a weighted average lease term of 12.8 years. the tenants occupying the new properties operate in 32 industries and the property types consist of 85.7% retail, 6.6% industrial and distribution, 6.4% office, and 1.3% manufacturing, based on rental revenue.  none of our real estate investments caused any one tenant to be 10% or more of our total assets at december 31, 2014.
the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual net operating income, which, in the case of a net leased property, is equal to the aggregate base rent under the lease for the first full year of each lease, divided by the total cost of the property.  since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent, we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above.
in the case of a property under development or expansion, the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return.  when the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion, the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as follows: estimated net operating income (determined by the lease) for the first full year of each lease, divided by our projected total investment in the property, including land, construction and capitalized interest costs. of the $1.4 billion we invested during 2014, $81.9 million was invested in 40 properties under development or expansion with an estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 8.4%.  we may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future.
of the 203 properties re-leased during 2014, 173 properties were re-leased to existing tenants, nine were re-leased to new tenants without vacancy, and 21 were re-leased to new tenants after a period of vacancy.  the annual rent on these 203 leases was $33.9 million, as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of $34.2 million.
at december 31, 2014, our average annualized rental revenue was approximately $13.07 per square foot on the 4,257 leased properties in our portfolio.  at december 31, 2014, we classified eight properties with a carrying amount of $14.8 million as held for sale on our balance sheet. the disposal of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results.
investments in existing properties in 2014, we capitalized costs of $6.0 million on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of $821,000 for re-leasing costs and $5.2 million for building and tenant improvements.  in 2013, we capitalized costs of $8.5 million on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of $1.3 million for re-leasing costs and $7.2 million for building and tenant improvements.
as part of our re-leasing costs, we typically pay leasing commissions and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions.  leasing commissions are paid based on the commercial real estate industry standard and any rent concessions provided are minimal.  we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations.
the majority of our building and tenant improvements relate to roof repairs, hvac improvements, and parking lot resurfacing and replacements.  it is not customary for us to offer significant tenant improvements on our properties as tenant incentives.  the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly, depending on the rental market, tenant credit worthiness, and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases.
impact of real estate and credit markets in the commercial real estate market, property prices generally continue to fluctuate. likewise, during certain periods, the u.s. credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which may impact our access to and cost of capital. we continually monitor the commercial real estate and u.s. credit markets carefully and, if required, will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly. see our discussion of risk factors in this annual report.
increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders we have continued our 46-year policy of paying monthly dividends.  in addition, we increased the dividend four times during 2014, and two times during 2015.  as of february 2015, we have paid 69 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 79 times since our listing on the nyse in 1994.
universal shelf registration in february 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec, which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in february 2016. this replaces our prior shelf registration statement.  in accordance with sec rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit. the securities covered by this registration statement include (1) common stock, (2) preferred stock, (3) debt securities, (4) depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock, (5) warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares, and (6) any combination of these securities. we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered. the specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering.
issuance of common stock in april 2014, we issued 13,800,000 shares of common stock, including 1,800,000 shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their option to purchase additional shares.  after underwriting discounts and other offering costs of $22.8 million, the net proceeds of $528.6 million were used to repay borrowings under our acquisition credit facility.
dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan in march 2011, we established a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, or the drspp, to provide our common stockholders, as well as new investors, with a convenient and economical method of purchasing our common stock and reinvesting their distributions.  the drspp also allows our current stockholders to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their distributions.  the drspp authorizes up to 6,000,000 common shares to be issued.  during 2014, we issued 3,527,166 shares and raised approximately $158.5 million under the drspp.
credit agency ratings the borrowing interest rates under our credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. we are currently assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds:  moodys investors service has assigned a rating of baa1 with a stable outlook, standard & poors ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb+ with a stable outlook to our senior notes, and fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb+ with a stable outlook.
based on our current ratings, the current facility interest rate is libor plus 1.075% with a facility commitment fee of 0.175%, for all-in drawn pricing of 1.25% over libor.  the credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between: (i) libor plus 1.85% if our credit rating is lower than bbb-/baa3 and (ii) libor plus 1.00% if our credit rating is a-/a3 or higher.  in addition, our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings, which range from: (i) 0.45% for a rating lower than bbb-/baa3, and (ii) 0.15% for a credit rating of a-/a3 or higher.
we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions.  if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change, our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease.
the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. moreover, a rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt securities, preferred stock or common stock.
notes outstanding our senior unsecured note and bond obligations consist of the following as of december 31, 2014, sorted by maturity date (dollars in millions):
all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates and contain various covenants, which we remain in compliance with at december 31, 2014. additionally, interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually.
the following is a summary of the key financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes, as defined and calculated per the terms of our senior notes and bonds. these calculations, which are not based on u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap, measurements, are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our senior notes and bonds as well as to disclose our current compliance with such covenants, and are not measures of our liquidity or performance.  the actual amounts as of december 31, 2014 are:
limitation on incurrence of total debt          ≤ 60% of adjusted assets    43.8%
limitation on incurrence of secured debt        ≤ 40% of adjusted assets     7.6%
(1) this covenant is calculated on a pro forma basis for the preceding four-quarter period on the assumption that: (i) the incurrence of any debt (as defined in the covenants) incurred by us since the first day of such four-quarter period and the application of the proceeds therefrom (including to refinance other debt since the first day of such four-quarter period), (ii) the repayment or retirement of any of our debt since the first day of such four-quarter period, and (iii) any acquisition or disposition by us of any asset or group since the first day of such four-quarters had in each case occurred on january 1, 2014, and subject to certain additional adjustments.  such pro forma ratio has been prepared on the basis required by that debt service covenant, reflects various estimates and assumptions and is subject to other uncertainties, and therefore does not purport to reflect what our actual debt service coverage ratio would have been had transactions referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence occurred as of january 1, 2014, nor does it purport to reflect our debt service coverage ratio for any future period.  the following is our calculation of debt service coverage at december 31, 2014 (in thousands, for trailing twelve months):
fixed charge coverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as the debt service coverage ratio, except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator.  similar to debt service coverage ratio, we consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a companys ability to make its interest and preferred stock dividend payments.  our calculations of both debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.  the presentation of debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios should not be considered as alternatives to any u.s. gaap operating performance measures.  below is our calculation of fixed charges at december 31, 2014 (in thousands, for trailing twelve months):
table of obligations the following table summarizes the maturity of each of our obligations as of december 31, 2014 (dollars in millions):
leases          leases notes                                                 paid by         paid by year of       credit                  and      term       mortgages                        realty             our maturity       facility(1)        bonds(2)      loan      payable(3)     interest(4)     income(5)      tenants(6)      other(7)        totals
(1)                             the initial term of the credit facility expires in may 2016 and includes, at our option, a one-year extension, which has been assumed to occur in the table above.
(4)   interest on the term loan, notes, bonds, mortgages payable, and credit facility has been calculated based on outstanding balances as of december 31, 2014 through their respective maturity dates.
(7)   other consists of $33.6 million of commitments under construction contracts and $735,000 of contingent payments for tenant improvements and leasing costs.
our credit facility and notes payable obligations are unsecured. accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations.
preferred stock and preferred units outstanding in 2006, we issued 8,800,000 shares of class e preferred stock at a price of $25.00 per share. since december 2011, the shares of class e preferred stock were redeemable at our option, for $25.00 per share. in october 2014, we redeemed all of the 8,800,000 shares of our class e preferred stock for $25.00 per share, plus accrued dividends. we incurred a charge of $6.0 million, representing the class e preferred stock original issuance costs that we paid in 2006.
in february 2012, we issued 14.95 million shares of our class f preferred stock at $25.00 per share. in april 2012, we issued an additional 1.4 million shares of class f preferred stock at $25.2863 per share. beginning february 15, 2017, shares of our class f preferred stock are redeemable at our option for $25.00 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. dividends on the shares of our class f preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears. we are current on our obligations to pay dividends on our class f preferred stock.
as part of our acquisition of arct in january 2013, we issued 6,750 partnership units, with a carrying value of $6.75 million. payments on these preferred units are made monthly in arrears at rate of 2% per annum, or $135,000, and are included in interest expense. in january 2015, we redeemed all 6,750 tau operating partnership preferred units for $1,000 per unit, plus accrued and unpaid dividends.
no unconsolidated investments we have no unconsolidated investments, nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts.
results of operations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap, and are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap, many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies. one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties. depreciation on a majority of our buildings and improvements is computed using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 25 to 35 years for buildings and 4 to 15 years for improvements, which we believe are appropriate estimates of useful life. if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life, it could have a material impact on our results of operations.
management must make significant assumptions in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  when acquiring a property for investment purposes, we typically allocate the fair value of real estate acquired to: (1) land, (2) building and improvements, and (3) identified intangible assets and liabilities, based in each case on their estimated fair values. intangible assets and liabilities consist of above-market or below-market lease value of in-place leases, the value of in-place leases, and tenant relationships, as applicable.  in an acquisition of multiple properties, we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties.  the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and is often based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located.  in addition, any assumed mortgages receivable or payable and any assumed or issued noncontrolling interests are recorded at their estimated fair values. the estimated fair values of our mortgages payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using applicable interest rates that have been adjusted for factors, such as industry type, tenant investment grade, maturity date, and comparable borrowings for similar assets.  the initial allocation of the purchase price is based on managements preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available.  subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period, which typically does not exceed one year.  the use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses.
another significant judgment must be made as to if, and when, impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. a provision is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) plus estimated disposition proceeds (undiscounted) are less than the current book value of the property. key inputs that we estimate in this analysis include projected rental rates, estimated holding periods, capital expenditures, and property sales capitalization rates. if a property is held for sale, it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value, less estimated cost to sell. the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheets. our strategy of primarily holding properties, long-term, directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable, thus requiring the recognition of an impairment. however, if our strategy, or one or more of the above assumptions were to change in the future, an impairment may need to be recognized. if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment, they could have a material impact on our results of operations.
for purposes of determining the same store rent property pool, we include all properties that were owned for the entire year-to-date period, for both the current and prior year except for properties during the current or prior year that; (i) were vacant at any time, (ii) were under development or redevelopment, and (iii) were involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced. each of the exclusions from the same store pool is separately addressed within the applicable sentences above explaining the changes in rental revenue for the period.
of the 4,327 properties in the portfolio at december 31, 2014, 4,308, or 99.6%, are single-tenant properties and the remaining nineteen are multi-tenant properties. of the 4,308 single-tenant properties, 4,238, or 98.4%, were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant) of approximately 10.2 years at december 31, 2014. of our 4,238 leased single-tenant properties, 3,789 or 89.4% were under leases that provide for increases in rents through:
our portfolio of real estate, leased primarily to regional and national tenants under net leases, continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders.  at december 31, 2014, our portfolio of 4,327 properties was 98.4% leased with 70 properties available for lease as compared to 98.2% occupancy, or 70 properties available for lease at december 31, 2013. it has been our experience that approximately 2% to 4% of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time; however, it is possible that the number of properties available for lease could exceed these levels in the future.
tenant reimbursements contractually obligated reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses were $37.1 million in 2014, compared to $24.9 million in 2013 and $14.6 million in 2012.  the increase in tenant reimbursements from 2013 to 2014 is primarily due to our 2013 and 2014 acquisitions.  our tenant reimbursements are equal to our reimbursable property expenses for any given period.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was $374.7 million in 2014, compared to $306.8 million in 2013 and $147.5 million in 2012. the increases in depreciation and amortization in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to the acquisition of properties in 2014 and 2013, which was partially offset by property sales in those same years.  as discussed in the sections entitled funds from operations available to common stockholders (ffo) and adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders (affo), depreciation and amortization is a non-cash item that is added back to net income available to common stockholders for our calculation of ffo and affo.

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by $5.8 million to $51.1 million in 2014, as compared to $56.9 million in 2013. general and administrative expenses were $38.1 million in 2012.  included in general and administrative expenses are acquisition transaction costs (excluding arct merger-related costs) of $453,000 for 2014, $2.1 million for 2013 and $2.4 million for 2012. general and administrative expenses decreased during 2014 primarily due to lower stock compensation costs, including the $3.7 million for accelerated vesting that occurred in july 2013, and lower acquisition transaction costs. in january 2015, we had 125 employees, as compared to 116 employees in january 2014 and 97 employees in january 2013.
property expenses consist of costs associated with unleased properties, non-net leased properties and general portfolio expenses, as well as contractually obligated reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses. expenses related to unleased properties and non-net leased properties include, but are not limited to, property taxes, maintenance, insurance, utilities, property inspections, bad debt expense and legal fees. general portfolio costs include, but are not limited to, insurance, legal, property inspections, and title search fees. at december 31, 2014, 70 properties were available for lease, as compared to 70 at december 31, 2013 and 84 at december 31, 2012.
property expenses were $53.9 million (including $37.1 million reimbursable) in 2014, $38.9 million (including $24.9 million reimbursable) in 2013 and $21.3 million (including $14.6 million reimbursable) in 2012. the increase in property expenses in 2014 is primarily attributable to the increased portfolio size, which contributed to higher maintenance and utilities, property taxes, ground rent expenses, legal costs, and bad debt expense, along with higher contractually obligated reimbursements primarily due to our 2013 and 2014 acquisitions, partially offset by lower insurance costs.
income taxes income taxes were $3.5 million in 2014, as compared to $2.4 million in 2013 and $1.1 million in 2012. these amounts are for city and state income and franchise taxes paid by realty income and its subsidiaries.  the increase for 2014 is primarily related to higher city and state income and franchise taxes paid by realty income and its subsidiaries, primarily related to increased portfolio size.
merger-related costs merger-related costs include, but are not limited to, advisor fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing fees and transfer taxes related to our acquisition of arct.  merger-related costs were $13.0 million in 2013 and $7.9 million in 2012.  on a diluted per common share basis, these expenses represented $0.07 for 2013 and $0.06 for 2012.  no merger-related costs were incurred in 2014.
crest sold one property for $820,000 and one property for $597,000 during 2014 and 2013, respectively.  neither of these sales resulted in a gain. the results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations.  during 2012, crest did not sell any properties.
·                  enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio;
at december 31, 2014, we classified real estate with a carrying amount of $14.8 million as held for sale on our balance sheet. in 2015, we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and anticipate approximately $50 million in yet to be identified property sales for all of 2015.  we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions, if there are attractive opportunities available. however, we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties.
discontinued operations during the first quarter of 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued guidance that changes the definition of discontinued operations by limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have, or will have, a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results.  we early adopted the requirements of this accounting pronouncement in the first quarter of 2014.  as a result, our results of operations for all disposals and properties classified as held for sale that were not previously reported in discontinued operations in our 2013 annual report on form 10-k are presented within income from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of income.
net income available to common stockholders net income available to common stockholders was $227.6 million in 2014, compared to $203.6 million in 2013, an increase of $24.0 million. on a diluted per common share basis, net income was $1.04 in 2014, as compared to $1.06 in 2013, a decrease of $0.02, or 1.9%.  net income available to common stockholders was $114.5 million in 2012. net income available to common stockholders for 2014 includes a non-cash redemption charge of $6.0 million on the shares of class e preferred stock that were redeemed in october 2014, which represents $0.03 on a diluted per common share basis. this charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the class e preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006. net income available to common stockholders for 2013 was impacted by an unusually large gain on property sales, which represents $0.18 on a diluted per common share basis.  additionally, net income available to common stockholders for 2013 includes $13.0 million of merger-related costs for the acquisition of arct, which represents $0.07 on a diluted per common share basis, and $3.7 million for accelerated vesting of restricted shares that occurred in july 2013 from ten-year vesting to five years, which represents $0.02 on a diluted per common share basis.
redemption value over the carrying value of the class e preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006.  ffo in 2013 and 2012 was normalized to exclude $13.0 million and $7.9 million of merger-related costs, which represents $0.07 and $0.06 on a diluted per common share basis for 2013 and 2012, respectively.  ffo for 2013 includes $3.7 million for accelerated vesting of restricted shares that occurred in july 2013 from ten-year vesting to five years, which represents $0.02 on a diluted per common share basis.   all references to ffo for 2013 and 2012 reflect the adjustments for merger-related costs for the acquisition of arct.
depreciation of furniture, fixtures and equipment                                       (482   )            (288   )            (249   )
(2)   the computation of diluted ffo does not assume conversion of securities that are convertible to common shares if the conversion of those securities would increase diluted ffo per share in a given period.
we define ffo, a non-gaap measure, consistent with the national association of real estate investment trusts definition, as net income available to common stockholders, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, plus impairments of depreciable real estate assets, reduced by gains on property sales and extraordinary items.  our ffo for 2013 and 2012 has also been normalized to exclude arct merger-related costs.
we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reits operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back items such as depreciation and impairments for ffo. the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a reit, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative. the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure. in addition, ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility.
capitalized leasing costs and commissions                                                    (821   )          (1,280   )          (1,619   )

(1)                 see reconciling items for ffo presented under funds from operations available to common stockholders (ffo).
(2)                 includes the amortization of costs incurred and capitalized when our notes were issued in march 2003, november 2003, march 2005, september 2005, september 2006, september 2007, june 2010, june 2011, october 2012, july 2013, june 2014 and september 2014.  additionally, this includes the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred and capitalized in connection with our assumption of the mortgages payable and the issuance of our term loan.  the deferred financing costs are being amortized over the lives of the respective mortgages and term loan.  no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included.
(3)                 includes adjustments allocable to both non-controlling interests and capital lease obligations.
(4)                 the computation of diluted affo does not assume conversion of securities that are convertible to common shares if the conversion of those securities would increase diluted affo per share in a given period.
we believe the non-gaap financial measure affo provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies.  in particular, affo provides an additional measure to compare the operating performance of different reits without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to measuring a particular companys on-going operating performance.  therefore, we believe that affo is an appropriate supplemental performance metric, and that the most appropriate gaap performance metric to which affo should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders.
presentation of the information regarding ffo and affo is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits, although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo and affo in the same way, so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful. furthermore, ffo and affo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance. ffo and affo should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities.  in addition, ffo and affo should not be considered as measures of liquidity, of our ability to make cash distributions, or of our ability to pay interest payments.
impact of inflation tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants sales volumes, increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), or fixed increases. we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time. during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in the leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation.

introduction and business overview
we are one of the premier consumer financial services companies in the united states. we provide a range of credit products through programs we have established with a diverse group of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare service providers, which we refer to as our "partners." during 2014, we financed $103.1 billion of purchase volume, and at december 31, 2014, we had $61.3 billion of loan receivables and 64.3 million active accounts. for the year ended december 31, 2014, we had net earnings of $2.1 billion, representing a return on assets of 3.2%.
we offer our credit products primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, synchrony bank. through the bank, we offer a range of deposit products insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation ("fdic"). we are continuing to expand our direct banking operations to increase our deposit base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for our credit activities. we had $35.0 billion in deposits at december 31, 2014.
our initial public offering on august 5, 2014, we closed the initial public offering (the "ipo") of 125 million shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $23.00 per share and on september 3, 2014, we issued an additional 3.5 million shares of our common stock pursuant to an option granted to the underwriters in the ipo (the "underwriters' option"). we received net proceeds from the ipo and the underwriters' option of approximately $2.8 billion. following the closing of the ipo and the underwriters' option, ge owned, and currently owns, approximately 84.6% of our common stock.
debt financings in connection with the ipo, we repaid all of our existing related party debt owed to gecc outstanding on the closing date of the ipo, which totaled $8.0 billion. we also entered into new term loan facilities with both third-party lenders (the "bank term loan") and gecc (the "gecc term loan"). the borrowings under these facilities at december 31, 2014 were $8.2 billion and $655 million, respectively. subsequent to december 31, 2014, we made additional prepayments in the aggregate to these facilities of $2.5 billion and $206 million, respectively. the borrowings under the bank term loan and gecc term loan following these additional prepayments were $5.7 billion and $449 million, respectively.
in august 2014, we also issued a total of $3.6 billion principal amount of unsecured senior notes with various maturities ranging from 2017 through 2024. in addition, in february 2015, we issued a total of $1.0 billion principal amount of unsecured senior notes maturing in 2020. see funding, liquidity and capital resources - funding sources - third-party debt for additional information on these facilities and unsecured senior notes.
agreements with ge and affiliates in connection with the ipo, we entered into a master agreement and a number of other agreements with ge and gecc setting forth various matters governing our relationship with ge and gecc following the completion of the ipo. see note 16. related party transactions to our consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information on these agreements with ge and gecc.
our sales platforms
we conduct our operations through a single business segment. profitability and expenses, including funding costs, loan losses and operating expenses, are managed for the business as a whole. substantially all of our operations are within the united states. we offer our products through three sales platforms (retail card, payment solutions and carecredit). those platforms are organized by the types of products we offer and the partners we work with, and are measured on platform revenues, loan receivables, new accounts and other sales metrics. see "item 1. business - our sales platforms."
(1)   for a definition of platform revenue, which is a non-gaap measure, and its reconciliation to interest and fees on loans, see "results of operations - platform analysis - non-gaap measure" below.
retail card retail card is a leading provider of private label credit cards, and also provides dual cards and small and medium-sized business credit products. our patented dual cards are credit cards that function as private label credit cards when used to purchase goods and services from our partners and as general purpose credit cards when used elsewhere. we offer one or more of these products primarily through 19 national and regional retailers with which we have ongoing program agreements. the average length of our relationship with these retail card partners is 16 years. retail card's platform revenue consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, plus other income, less retailer share arrangements. other income primarily consists of interchange fees earned on dual card transactions (when the card is used outside of our partners' sales channels) and fees paid to us by customers who purchase our debt cancellation products, less loyalty program payments. substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is on standard terms.
payment solutions payment solutions is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases, offering primarily private label credit cards and installment loans. at december 31, 2014, payment solutions offered these products through approximately 63,000 participating partners consisting of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups and industry associations. substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is promotional financing. payment solutions' platform revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, including "merchant discounts," which are fees paid to us by our partners in almost all cases to compensate us for all or part of foregone interest revenue associated with promotional financing.
carecredit carecredit is a leading provider of promotional financing to consumers for elective healthcare procedures or services, such as dental, veterinary, cosmetic, vision and audiology. at december 31, 2014, we had a network of carecredit providers that collectively have approximately 186,000 locations, the vast majority of which are individual or small groups of independent healthcare providers, through which we offer a carecredit branded private label credit card. substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is promotional financing. carecredit's platform revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, including merchant discounts.
our credit products
through our platforms, we offer three principal types of credit products: credit cards, commercial credit products and consumer installment loans. see "item 1. business - our credit products."
the following table sets forth each credit product by type and indicates the percentage of our total loan receivables that are under standard terms only or pursuant to a promotional financing offer at december 31, 2014.

credit cards we offer two principal types of credit cards: private label credit cards and dual cards:
•   private label credit cards. private label credit cards are partner-branded credit cards (e.g., lowe's or amazon) or program-branded credit cards (e.g., carcareone or carecredit) that are used primarily for the purchase of goods and services from the partner or within the program network. in retail card, credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended on standard terms only, and in payment solutions and carecredit, credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended pursuant to a promotional financing offer.
•   dual cards. our patented dual cards are credit cards that function as private label credit cards when used to purchase goods and services from our partners and as general purpose credit cards when used elsewhere. credit extended under our dual cards typically is extended under standard terms only. currently, only retail card offers dual cards. at december 31, 2014, we offered dual cards through 14 of our 19 active retail card programs.
commercial credit products we offer private label cards and co-branded cards for commercial customers that are similar to our consumer offerings. we also offer a commercial pay-in-full accounts receivable product to a wide range of business customers, and are rolling out an improved customer experience for this product with enhanced functionality. we offer commercial credit products primarily through our retail card platform to the commercial customers of our retail card partners.
installment loans in payment solutions, we originate installment loans to consumers (and a limited number of commercial customers) in the united states, primarily in the power product market (motorcycles, atvs and lawn and garden). installment loans are closed-end credit accounts where the customer pays down the outstanding balance in installments. installment loans are assessed periodic finance charges using fixed interest rates.
business trends and conditions
we believe our business and results of operations will be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions, including the following:
•   growth in loan receivables and interest income. we believe continuing improvement in the u.s. economy and employment rates will contribute to an increase in consumer credit spending. in addition, we expect the use of credit cards to continue to increase versus other forms of payment such as cash and checks. we anticipate that these trends, combined with our marketing and partner engagement strategies, will contribute to growth in our loan receivables. in the near-to medium term, we expect our total interest income to continue to grow, driven by the expected growth in average loan receivables. our historical growth rates in loan receivables and interest income have benefited from new partner acquisitions, and therefore, if we do not continue to acquire new partners, replace the retail card programs that are not being extended or otherwise grow our business, our growth rates in loan receivables and interest income in the future will be lower than in recent periods. in addition, we do not expect to make any significant changes to customer pricing or merchant discount pricing in the near term, and therefore we expect yields generated from interest and fees on interest-earning assets will remain relatively stable
•   changing funding mix and increased funding costs. prior to the ipo, the related party debt provided by gecc and its affiliates was one of our key funding sources. following the ipo, and repayment of all then-outstanding related party debt, our primary funding sources are now comprised of cash from operations, deposits (direct and brokered deposits), securitized financings and third-party debt. over time, we expect to raise additional unsecured debt financing and continue to increase our level of direct deposits, while using a portion of this funding to repay, in advance of the separation, all or a substantial portion of the remaining transitional funding from the gecc term loan, increase liquidity levels and support growth in our business. as a result of the growth in our third-party borrowings, our funding costs in the aggregate have increased following the ipo. at december 31, 2014, our third-party borrowings increased by approximately $11.8 billion compared to december 31, 2013. we expect the following factors to continue to impact our funding costs:
•   continued growth in our direct deposits as a source of stable and low cost funding;
•   the changing mix in our funding sources, as our historical related party debt was replaced during 2014 by higher cost funding provided by third-party credit facilities, unsecured debt financing and transitional funding from the gecc term loan; and
•   a rising interest rate environment
•   extended duration of program agreements. we have extended many of our 40 largest program agreements, and as a result, we expect to continue to benefit from these programs on a long-term basis as indicated by the following expiration schedule, which indicates for each period the number of programs scheduled to expire and the proportion of platform revenue that these programs comprised for the year ended december 31, 2014.
(1)   percentages stated as a proportion of total platform revenue for the year ended december 31, 2014.
(2)   in february 2015, we extended our program agreement with amazon, a retail card partner. the contractual expiration date following the extension of this program agreement is reflected in the above chart.
a total of 30 of our 40 largest program agreements now have an expiration date in 2017 or beyond. these 30 program agreements represented in the aggregate 67.2% of our total platform revenue for the year ended december 31, 2014 and 73.3% of our total loan receivables, including loan receivables held for sale, at december 31, 2014. in addition, we do not expect our program agreement with one of our 40 largest programs to extend beyond its current expiration date of october 2016. this program agreement represented 3.2% of our total platform revenue and 1.6% of our retailer share arrangements, in each case for the year ended december 31, 2014, and 2.5% of our total loan receivables, including loan receivables held for sale, at december 31, 2014.
•   increases in retailer share arrangement payments and other expense under extended program agreements. we believe that as a result of both the overall growth of our programs generally as well as amendments we have made to the terms of certain program agreements that we extended during 2014, the payments we make to our partners under these extended retailer share arrangements, in the aggregate, are likely to increase both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our net earnings. these increases will be offset in part by decreases in retailer share arrangement payments made to those partners whose programs are not being extended. overall, we expect our payments to our partners under our retailer share arrangements to grow generally in line with the growth of our retail card loan receivables.
in addition, under the terms of certain program agreements we have recently extended, we have agreed to dedicate increased marketing expense and other investments to promote these programs. we expect to benefit from these increased payments and other expense, as they will create additional incentives for our partners to support their programs and, in the case of increased marketing expense and other investments, directly promote these programs, all of which we expect will have a positive impact on purchase volume and result in higher loan receivables and increased interest and fees on loans. we also expect to benefit from the extended duration of our amended program agreements.
•   stable asset quality and enhancements to allowance for loan loss methodology. our credit performance continued to improve through 2014. our net charge-off rates decreased to 4.51% for the year ended december 31, 2014 from 4.68% for the year ended december 31, 2013, and our over-30 day delinquency rate decreased to 4.14% at december 31, 2014 from 4.35% at december 31, 2013, which are lower year-end levels than we experienced immediately prior to the financial crisis in 2007. in the near term, we expect the u.s. employment rate to continue to stabilize, and we do not anticipate making significant changes to our underwriting standards. accordingly, we expect our charge-off rates to remain relatively stable in the near term.
during 2012 and 2013, we enhanced our methodology for determining our allowance for loan losses, and as a result, we recognized incremental provisions of $343 million and $642 million in 2012 and 2013, respectively. we continue to review and evaluate our methodology and models, and we will implement further enhancements or changes to them, as needed.
•   increases in other expense to operate as a fully independent company. we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increases in other expense in order to operate as a fully independent public company. the components include increases in our advertising and marketing expense, corporate governance, risk management, capital planning, treasury, information technology, compliance, regulatory, internal audit and other control operations and infrastructure that is necessary to enable us to operate as a fully standalone company. we expect this incremental increase in our annual run rate of other expense to be fully incurred in 2015 after giving effect to anticipated savings from the reductions in corporate allocations by ge and transitional service payments to ge following the separation.
apart from the increase related to separation, we expect our expenses to continue to grow largely in line with business growth.
•   impact of regulatory developments. for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, we incurred $26 million and $133 million, respectively, in expenses related to litigation and regulatory matters. the expenses incurred in 2013, primarily related to an increase to our reserve for the matters settled with the cfpb and the doj in late 2013 and 2014. see "item 1. business-regulation-consumer financial services regulation."
•   increased capital and liquidity levels. we expect to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity resources to support our daily operations, our business growth, our credit ratings as well as regulatory and compliance requirements in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments. in connection with our application to the federal reserve board described above and the separation, we expect to continue to increase our capital and liquidity levels by, among other things, retaining net earnings and not paying a dividend or returning capital through stock repurchases until our application to the federal reserve board is approved. thereafter, our board of directors intends to consider a policy for paying dividends and may consider stock repurchases, in each case consistent with maintaining capital ratios well in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. at december 31, 2014, the company had an estimated fully phased-in basel iii tier 1 common ratio of 14.5%. we also expect that our liquidity portfolio will continue to grow in line with growth in our assets.
seasonality
in our retail card and payment solutions platforms, we experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from august through a peak in late december, with reductions in loan receivables occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down.
the seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations, delinquency metrics and the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods. these fluctuations are generally most evident between the fourth quarter and the first quarter of the following year.
in addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above, we also experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates. our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status. because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods, we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in charge-offs, as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end. consistent with this historical experience, we generally experience a higher allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period, as compared to the end of a calendar year. in addition, despite improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts, we may experience an increase in our allowance for loan losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end, reflecting these same seasonal trends.

highlights for year ended december 31, 2014
below are highlights of our performance for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, as applicable, except as otherwise noted.
•   net earnings increased 6.6% to $2,109 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, driven by higher net interest income and a reduction in our provision for loan losses, partially offset by increases in retailer share arrangements and other expenses.
•   net interest income increased 7.1% to $11,320 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily due to higher average loan receivables.
•   retailer share arrangements increased 8.5% to $2,575 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily as a result of improved performance, and the growth of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements, as well as from changes to the terms of the retailer share arrangements for those partners with whom we extended program agreements in late 2013 and in 2014.
•   loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables decreased with the over-30 day delinquency rate decreasing to 4.14% at december 31, 2014 from 4.35% at december 31, 2013, driven by continued improvement in the u.s. economy and employment rates. net charge-off rates decreased to 4.51% for the year ended december 31, 2014, from 4.68% for the year ended december 31, 2013.
•   provision for loan losses decreased by $155 million, or 5.0%, to $2,917 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. this decrease was driven primarily as a result of an incremental provision of $642 million recorded during 2013 relating to the enhancements to our allowance for loan loss methodology, which was not repeated in 2014. this decrease was partially offset by increased provisions in 2014 primarily driven by portfolio growth. our allowance coverage ratio (allowance for loan losses as a percent of end of period loan receivables) increased to 5.28% at december 31, 2014, as compared to 5.05% at december 31, 2013, reflecting a transition to a stable credit outlook at december 31, 2014 from an improving outlook at december 31, 2013.
•   other expense increased to $2,927 million from $2,484 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, driven by business growth, increased marketing investments and incremental costs associated with building our standalone infrastructure.
•   we completed the initial public offering of a total of 128.5 million shares of our common stock and our new debt financings which increased our indebtedness with third parties and reduced our funding from gecc. the net proceeds from these transactions increased our liquidity portfolio by $7.3 billion. our liquidity portfolio, including undrawn credit facilities, was $19.0 billion at december 31, 2014.
•   we have invested in our direct banking activities to grow our deposit base. total deposits have increased 35.9% to $35.0 billion at december 31, 2014, compared to december 31, 2013, driven primarily by growth in our direct deposits of 79.1% to $19.7 billion at december 31, 2014.
•   during the year ended december 31, 2014, we extended five program agreements in retail card (american eagle, gap inc., lowe's, qvc and sam's club), and in february 2015, we extended our program agreement with amazon. these programs represented, in the aggregate $22.2 billion in loan receivables at december 31, 2014. in addition, we extended our program agreement with paypal until october 2016 and do not expect it to extend beyond that date. based on notices received to date, existing program agreements with three retail card partners representing $0.5 billion in loan receivables, including loan receivables held for sale, at december 31, 2014, are not expected to be renewed.
•   during the year ended december 31, 2014, we entered into an agreement with bp, for a retail card program we expect to commence in mid-2015, and which we expect will become one of our 20 largest program agreements.
•   in our payment solutions sales platform, we increased the number of participating partners in our network by over 2,000 partners, compared to the number of partners at december 31, 2013. in our carecredit network, we increased the number of provider locations by over 9,000 locations, compared to the number of locations at december 31, 2013.
highlights for year ended december 31, 2013
below are highlights of our performance in 2013. these highlights generally are based on a comparison between our 2013 and 2012 results, except as otherwise noted.
•   net earnings decreased 6.6% to $1,979 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 driven primarily by an increase in our provision for loan losses as a result of enhancements to our allowance for loan loss methodology.
•   retailer share arrangements increased 19.6% to $2,373 million in 2013, primarily as a result of the growth and improved performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements, as well as by changes to the terms of the retailer share arrangements for those partners with whom we extended programs agreements in 2013.
•   loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables decreased with the over 30-day delinquency rate decreasing to 4.35% at december 31, 2013 from 4.58% at december 31, 2012. reduced delinquency rates were driven by improvements in the quality of our loan receivables and continued improvement in the u.s. economy and employment rates. net charge-off rates decreased to 4.68% in 2013 from 4.93% in 2012.
•   provision for loan losses increased by $507 million, or 19.8%, to $3,072 million in 2013 as a result of enhancements to our allowance for loan loss methodology, offset in part by improved portfolio performance. our allowance coverage ratio increased to 5.05% in 2013 from 4.35% in 2012.
•   other expense increased to $2,484 million in 2013 from $2,123 million in 2012. the increase to other expense was driven primarily by a $133 million increase in our consumer regulatory expenses (primarily related to an increase in our reserves for the matters settled with the cfpb and the doj in late 2013 and 2014), $78 million increase in employee costs, $61 million increase in marketing expense, $35 million increase in professional fees and $24 million increase in ge allocations and assessments. these increases (excluding the consumer regulatory expenses) were predominantly driven by the growth in purchase volume, transactions and receivables of our business.
•   we acquired metlife's direct-to-consumer retail banking platform. primarily as a result of the metlife acquisition, we increased our deposit funding from 40% at december 31, 2012 to 51% of our total funding at december 31, 2013 (an increase of $6,915 million) while decreasing funding from securitized financings from 37% to 31% and related party debt from 23% to 18%.
•   in 2013, we launched new programs with 16 partners (two in retail card (ebates and phillips 66) and 14 in payment solutions) and added 17,000 new providers to our carecredit network. we extended four program agreements in retail card (belk, brooks brothers, jcpenney and walmart) and 55 program agreements in payment solutions, representing $16.7 billion in loan receivables at december 31, 2013, and did not extend agreements with 34 retailers in payment solutions, representing $0.1 billion in loan receivables at december 31, 2013.

interest income interest income is comprised of interest and fees on loans, which includes merchant discounts provided by partners in almost all cases to compensate us for all or part of the promotional financing provided to their customers, and interest on cash and equivalents and investment securities. we include in interest and fees on loans any past due interest and fees deemed to be collectible. direct loan origination costs on credit card loans are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a one-year period and recorded in interest and fees on loans. for non-credit card receivables, direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan and recorded in interest and fees on loans.
we analyze interest income as a function of two principal components: average interest-earning assets and yield on average interest-earning assets. key drivers of average interest-earning assets include:
•   purchase volumes, which are influenced by a number of factors including macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence generally, our partners' sales and our ability to increase our share of those sales;
•   payment rates, reflecting the extent to which customers maintain a credit balance;
•   the size of our liquidity portfolio; and
•   portfolio acquisitions when we enter into new partner relationships.
key drivers of yield on average interest-earning assets include:
•   changes to our mix of loans (e.g., the number of loans bearing promotional rates as compared to standard rates);
•   credit performance and accrual status of our loans; and
•   yield earned on our liquidity portfolio.
interest income increased by $929 million, or 8.2%, for the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase was driven primarily by growth in our loan receivables.
•   average interest-earning assets. interest-earning assets are comprised primarily of loan receivables. average loan receivables, including loans held for sale, increased by $4,694 million, or 9.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase in average loan receivables was driven primarily by higher purchase volume resulting from an increase in average active credit card accounts to 60.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 from 56.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013.
•   yield on average interest-earning assets. the yield on interest-earning assets decreased to 18.60% for the year ended december 31, 2014 from 20.10% for the year ended december 31, 2013, driven primarily by an increase in our average interest-earning cash and equivalents which earn a lower yield than our loan receivables. the yield on our average loan receivables decreased slightly to 21.39% for the year ended december 31, 2014 from 21.55% for the year ended december 31, 2013, reflecting the impact of higher payment rates from our customers.
interest income increased by $1,004 million, or 9.7%, for the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was driven primarily by the increase in average interest-earning assets, which contributed $1,135 million to interest income for the year ended december 31, 2013, partially offset by the decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets from 21.22% to 20.10%, which reduced interest income by $131 million. while yield on interest-earning loan receivables was relatively flat, the significant increase in the amount of cash and equivalents in our liquidity portfolio negatively impacted overall yield on interest-earning assets.
•   average interest-earning assets. interest-earning assets are comprised primarily of loan receivables. average loan receivables increased by $4,858 million, or 10.2%, for the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase in average loan receivables was driven primarily by increased purchase volumes, as average annual purchase volume per account increased to $1,668 for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $1,620 for the year ended december 31, 2012, and the average active credit card accounts increased to 56.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from 53.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. our average account balance increased to $932 for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $897 for the year ended december 31, 2012, reflecting the increase in purchase volumes and lower payment rates. the increase in average loan receivables also reflects the addition of the assets related to the acquisition of the phillips 66 portfolio, which was completed in the second quarter of 2013.
•   yield on average interest-earning assets. the yield on interest-earning assets decreased to 20.10% for the year ended december 31, 2013 from 21.22% for the year ended december 31, 2012, driven primarily by yield on average interest-earning loan receivables and the size of our liquidity portfolio (which increased to $2,103 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 from $1,037 million for the year ended december 31, 2012). the lower interest yield on interest-earning loan receivables for the year ended december 31, 2013 was largely attributable to a decrease in late fees as a percentage of average interest-earning loan receivables.
interest expense interest expense is incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities, which consisted of interest-bearing deposit accounts, borrowings of consolidated securitization entities, related party debt provided by gecc, the bank term loan and senior unsecured notes.
•   the amounts outstanding of our borrowings, deposits and other funding sources;
•   the interest rate environment and its effect on interest rates paid on our funding sources; and
•   the changing mix in our funding sources among deposits, gecc financing and securitization borrowings and other third-party debt.
interest expense increased by $180 million, or 24.3%, for the year ended december 31, 2014, driven primarily by increases in average interest-bearing liabilities of $7,104 million, or 14.9%. the increase in average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended december 31, 2014 were driven primarily by increases of $7,705 million in our average interest-bearing deposit accounts, as well as from the new third-party debt incurred in connection with the ipo, partially offset by a reduction in average borrowings under our securitization programs and our related party debt. our cost of funds increased to 1.69% for the year ended december 31, 2014 from 1.56% for the year ended december 31, 2013.
interest expense decreased slightly by $3 million, or 0.4%, for the year ended december 31, 2013, driven by a lower average cost of funds (1.56% for the year ended december 31, 2013 versus 1.76% for the year ended december 31, 2012). this decrease was substantially offset by an increase in average interest-bearing liabilities, to $47,614 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, from $42,343 million for the year ended december 31, 2012.
net interest income net interest income represents the difference between interest income and interest expense. we expect net interest income as a percentage of interest-earning assets to be influenced by changes in the interest rate environment, changes in our mix of products, the level of loans bearing promotional rates as compared to our standard rates, credit performance of our loans and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-bearing liabilities.
net interest income increased by $749 million, or 7.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2014, driven by growth in loan receivables, partially offset by higher interest expense and a decrease in our yield on interest-earning assets due to a higher average interest-earning cash and equivalents balance.
net interest income increased by $1,007 million, or 10.5%, for the year ended december 31, 2013, driven primarily by an increase in average interest-earning receivables.
retailer share arrangements most of our retail card program agreements and certain other program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partner if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractually defined threshold. these arrangements are designed to align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products. although the share arrangements vary by partner, these arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program, based typically on agreed upon program revenues (including interest income and certain other income) less agreed upon program expenses (including interest expense, provision for loan losses, retailer payments and operating expenses), and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold. the threshold and economic performance of a program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on, among other things, agreed upon measures of program expenses rather than our actual expenses, and therefore increases in our actual expenses (such as funding costs or operating expenses) may not necessarily result in reduced payments under our retailer share arrangements. these arrangements are typically designed to permit us to achieve an economic return before we are required to make payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold. our payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements have increased in recent years (both in absolute terms and as a proportion of interest income), partially as a result of the growth of our receivables related to programs with retailer share arrangements and improvements in the credit performance of these receivables. in addition, we have made changes to the terms of certain program agreements that have been re-negotiated in the past few years that have contributed to the increase in payments to partners pursuant to retailer share arrangements.
we believe that our retailer share arrangements have been effective in helping us to grow our business by aligning our partners' interests with ours. we also believe that changes to the terms of certain program agreements that have contributed to the increase in our retailer share arrangement payments will help us to grow our business by providing an additional incentive to the relevant partners to promote our credit products going forward. payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements would generally decrease, and mitigate the impact on our profitability, in the event of declines in the performance of the programs or the occurrence of other unfavorable developments that impact the calculation of payments to our partners pursuant to our retailer share arrangements.
retailer share arrangements increased by $202 million, or 8.5%, for the year ended december 31, 2014, driven by the growth and improved performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements, including the effect of a lower provision for loan losses. the increase was also driven by changes to the terms of the retailer share arrangements for those partners with whom we extended program agreements in the second half of 2013 and in 2014.
retailer share arrangements increased by $389 million, or 19.6%, for the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was driven by the growth and improved performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements, as well as by changes to the terms of the retailer share arrangements for those partners with whom we extended program agreements in 2013.
provision for loan losses provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at each period end date. provision for loan losses in each period is a function of net charge-offs (gross charge-offs net of recoveries) and the required level of the allowance for loan losses. during 2012 we began a process to enhance our allowance for loan losses methodology by revising our estimates to determine the incurred loss period for each type of loss (i.e., aged, fraud, deceased, settlement, other non-aged and bankruptcy) by partner. this enhancement resulted in a more granular portfolio segmentation analysis, by loss type, included a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the portfolio's allowance for loan losses, which compared the allowance for losses to projected net charge-offs over the next 12 months, in a manner consistent with regulatory guidance, and was designed to provide a better estimate of the date of a probable loss event and length of time required for a probable loss event to result in a charge-off. we continue to review and evaluate our methodology, models and the underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments we use, and we will implement further enhancements or changes to them, as needed.
provision for loan losses decreased by $155 million, or 5.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2014.  this decrease was driven primarily as a result of an incremental provision of $642 million recorded in 2013 relating to the enhancements to our allowance for loan loss methodology, which was not repeated in the current period.  this decrease was partially offset by increased provisions in 2014 primarily related to portfolio growth.  our allowance coverage ratio (allowance for loan losses as a percent of period-end loan receivables) increased to 5.28% at december 31, 2014, as compared to 5.05% at december 31, 2013, reflecting a transition to a stable credit outlook at december 31, 2014 from an improving outlook at december 31, 2013.
provision for loan losses increased by $507 million, or 19.8%, for the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was driven primarily by the enhancements to our allowance for loan loss methodology referred to above and loan receivables growth, which was offset in part by lower provisions as a result of improvements to our delinquency and charge-off rates.
interchange revenue                          $389              $324              $287
interchange revenue we earn interchange fees on dual card transactions outside of our partners' locations, based on a flat fee plus a percent of the purchase amount. we also process general purpose card transactions for some payment solutions and carecredit partners as their acquiring bank, for which we obtain an interchange fee. growth in interchange revenue has been, and is expected to continue to be, driven primarily by growth in our dual card product.
interchange revenue increased by $65 million, or 20.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2014, and by $37 million, or 12.9%, for the year ended december 31, 2013, due to increases in dual card purchase volume outside of our retail partners' sales channels.
debt cancellation fees debt cancellation fees relate to payment protection products purchased by our credit card customers. customers who choose to purchase these products are charged a monthly fee based on their account balance. in return, we will cancel all or a portion of a customer's credit card balance in the event of certain qualifying life events. in october 2012, we ceased debt cancellation product sales via phone calls to our customer service department and began to only offer the product online and, on a limited basis, by direct mail, which has led to a decrease in new enrollments for this product and is expected to result in a lower level of income generated by this product in the future as the balances of existing accounts enrolled in this program decrease over time.
debt cancellation fees decreased by $49 million, or 15.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2014, driven by fewer customers being enrolled in the product.
debt cancellation fees increased by $15 million, or 4.9%, for the year ended december 31, 2013, driven primarily by higher average account balances of customers that had purchased our debt cancellation product.
loyalty programs we operate a number of loyalty programs in our retail card platform that are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer, while reinforcing the value of the card and strengthening cardholder loyalty. these programs typically provide cardholders with rewards in the form of merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a pre-set spending level on their private label or dual card. other programs provide cash back or reward points, which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards. growth in loyalty program payments has been, and is expected to continue to be, driven by growth in purchase volume related to existing loyalty programs and the rollout of new loyalty programs.
loyalty programs cost increased by $68 million, or 31.9%, for the year ended december 31, 2014, arising from the launch of new rewards programs with our partners and growth in existing loyalty programs purchase volume.
loyalty programs cost increased by $14 million, or 7.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily due to increased purchase volume.
other other includes a variety of items including ancillary fees and investment gains/losses.
other increased by $37 million, or 56.9%, for the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily due to a $46 million gain recorded in connection with portfolio sales in the fourth quarter of 2014.
other decreased by $22 million, or 25.3%, for the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily due to lower ancillary fees.
employee costs                                 $866                $698                $620

information processing                          212                 193                 165
employee costs employee costs primarily consist of employee compensation and benefit costs.
employee costs increased by $168 million, or 24.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2014, and by $78 million, or 12.6%, for the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily related to additional compensation expenses for new employees related to the building of our standalone infrastructure and to support business growth and salary increases for existing employees.
professional fees professional fees consist primarily of outsourced provider fees (e.g., collection agencies and call centers), legal, accounting and consulting fees, and recruiting expenses.
professional fees increased by $121 million, or 24.9%, for the year ended december 31, 2014. these expense increases were due to higher professional and other consulting fees related to the ipo, our planned separation from ge, growth of the retail deposit platform and other business growth (e.g., increased active accounts and increased purchase volumes).
professional fees increased by $35 million, or 7.8%, for the year ended december 31, 2013. these expense increases were driven primarily by our business growth.
marketing and business development marketing and business development costs consist primarily of our contractual and discretionary marketing spend, as well as amortization expense associated with retail partner contract acquisitions and extensions.
marketing and business development costs increased by $191 million, or 71.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2014, due to increased marketing expenses for our programs, investments in our brand, including the launch of our new advertising campaign, and increased amortization expense associated with program acquisitions and extensions.
marketing and business development costs increased by $61 million, or 29.3%, for the year ended december 31, 2013, due to increased contractual marketing expenses under our program agreements resulting from growth in the business.
information processing information processing costs primarily consist of fees related to outsourced information processing providers, credit card associations and software licensing agreements.
information processing costs increased by $19 million, or 9.8%, for the year ended december 31, 2014, due to higher transaction volume and increased software licensing and maintenance expense.
information processing costs increased by $28 million, or 17.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2013, due to higher transaction volume and associated outsourcing fees.
other other primarily consists of corporate overhead allocations, postage, fraud expense, litigation and regulatory matters expense and various other smaller cost items such as facilities leases and maintenance, leased equipment and telephone charges. as discussed under "-services and funding provided by ge," prior to the ipo, ge provided certain services to us, which we allocated to corporate overhead unless the costs associated with such services were directly billed and included in the appropriate cost categories (e.g., employee benefit costs are included in employee costs above). postage is driven primarily by the number of our active accounts and the percentage of customers that utilize our electronic billing option. fraud is driven primarily by the number of our dual card active accounts.
the "other" component decreased for the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily due to lower corporate overhead allocations and assessments from gecc and a decrease in litigation and regulatory expense. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in expense driven by business growth. following the ipo, we no longer receive corporate overhead allocations and assessments from gecc. all services provided by gecc to us following the ipo are directly billed to us in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreement, and are included in the appropriate cost categories. see note 16. related party transactions to our consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information on our transactions with ge and gecc.
the "other" component increased for the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily due to an increase in litigation and regulatory matters expense of $133 million. our litigation and regulatory matters expense increased in 2013 as we settled a carecredit investigation pursuant to which we will pay up to $34.1 million, as well as increased reserves for other regulatory matters.
provision for income taxes we are included in the consolidated u.s. federal and state income tax returns of ge, where applicable, but also file certain separate state and foreign income tax returns. the tax provision is presented on a separate company basis as if we were a separate filer. the effects of tax adjustments and settlements from taxing authorities are presented in our consolidated and combined financial statements in the period to which they relate as if we were a separate filer. our current obligations for taxes are settled with our parent on an estimated basis and adjusted in later periods as appropriate and are reflected in our consolidated and combined financial statements in the periods in which those settlements occur. we recognize the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws. see "critical accounting estimates-income taxes" for a discussion of the significant judgments and estimates related to income taxes.
our effective tax rate increased to 37.7% from 37.0% for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2014 differs from the effective tax rate in the previous year primarily due to changes in state reserves, certain non-deductible expenses in the current year and an item related to an internal corporate reorganization in the year ended december 31, 2014. in each period, the effective tax rate differs from the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0%, primarily due to state income taxes.
platform analysis as discussed above under "-our sales platforms," we offer our products through three sales platforms (retail card, payment solutions and carecredit), which management measures based on their revenue-generating activities. the following is a discussion of the platform revenue for each of our platforms.
non-gaap measure in order to assess and internally report the revenue performance of our three sales platforms, we use a measure we refer to as "platform revenue." platform revenue is the sum of three line items in our consolidated and combined statements of earnings prepared in accordance with gaap: "interest and fees on loans," plus "other income," less "retailer share arrangements." platform revenue itself is not a measure presented in accordance with gaap. we deduct retailer share arrangements but do not deduct other line item expenses, such as interest expense, provision for loan losses and other expense, because those items are managed for the business as a whole. we believe that platform revenue is a useful measure to investors because it represents management's view of the net revenue contribution of each of our platforms. this measure should not be considered a substitute for interest and fees on loans or other measures of performance we have reported in accordance with gaap. the reconciliation of platform revenue to interest and fees on loans for each platform is set forth in the table included in the discussion of each of our three platforms below. the following table sets forth the reconciliation of total platform revenue to total interest and fees on loans for the periods indicated.
platform revenue                            $10,126              $9,422              $8,800

retail card platform revenue increased by $512 million, or 8.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily the result of an increase in interest and fees on loans driven by an increase in average loan receivables, partially offset by increases in retailer share arrangement payments. the increases in these payments were driven by the factors discussed under the heading "retailer share arrangements" above.
retail card platform revenue increased by $417 million, or 7.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was primarily the result of an increase in interest and fees on loans driven by an increase in average loan receivables, offset in part by an increase in retailer share arrangement payments as a result of program growth and improved performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements, as well as changes to the terms of the retailer share arrangements for those partners with whom we extended programs agreements in 2013.
payment solutions the following table sets forth supplemental information relating to our payment solutions platform for the periods indicated.

carecredit platform revenue increased by $125 million, or 8.3%, for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily the result of an increase in interest and fees on loans driven primarily by an increase in average loan receivables.
carecredit platform revenue increased by $145 million, or 10.6%, for the year ended december 31, 2013. this increase was primarily the result of an increase in interest and fees on loans driven by an increase in average loan receivables.
services provided by ge following the ipo, ge owns approximately 84.6% of our common stock and continues to provide a variety of services to us, which are governed by the tsa and various other agreements with ge and gecc that we entered into in connection with the ipo. the services provided include, among other things, employee benefits and benefit administration, information technology, telecommunication services and leases for vehicles, equipment and facilities. under the tsa, all of the costs billed to us by ge subsequent to the ipo are at ge's cost in accordance with historic billing methodologies. we expect the majority of the services provided by ge will be replaced within two years from the closing date of the ipo.
for periods prior to the ipo, we were an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ge and gecc, and in addition to the services discussed above, we also received a corporate overhead allocation and assessment from ge and gecc for corporate activities that either directly or indirectly benefited our business.
funding provided by gecc following the ipo, the funding provided to us by gecc is the gecc term loan, of which $655 million was outstanding at december 31, 2014. prior to the ipo, gecc was a key source of funding for our business.
subsequent to december 31, 2014, we prepaid an aggregate of $206 million of the gecc term loan, including through the use of proceeds from additional third-party borrowings. following these prepayments, the indebtedness outstanding under the gecc term loan was $449 million.
see note 16. related party transactions to our consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information on our transactions with ge and gecc, and see funding, liquidity and capital resources - funding sources - related party debt for additional information on the funding provided by gecc to us and the related interest expense.
investment securities
the following discussion provides supplemental information regarding our investment securities portfolio. all of our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale at december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, and are primarily short-term obligations of the u.s. treasury or held to comply with the community reinvestment act. investment securities classified as available-for-sale are reported in our consolidated and combined statements of financial position at fair value. our portfolio of investment securities consisted primarily of short-term obligations of the u.s. treasury, state and municipal bonds and residential mortgage-backed securities.
the following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair value of our investment securities at the dates indicated:

(1)   amounts stated represent estimated fair value.
(2)   weighted average yield is calculated based on the amortized cost of each security. in calculating yield, no adjustment has been made with respect to any tax exempt obligations.
at december 31, 2014, we did not hold investments in any single issuer with an aggregate book value that exceeded 10% of equity.
the following discussion provides supplemental information regarding our loan receivables portfolio.
loan receivables are our largest category of assets and represent our primary source of revenues. the following table sets forth the composition of our loan receivables portfolio by product type at the dates indicated.

(1)   credit card loans have minimum payment requirements but no stated maturity and therefore are included in the due within one year category. however, many of our credit card holders will revolve their balances, which may extend their repayment period beyond one year for balances at december 31, 2014.

impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings our loss mitigation strategy is intended to minimize economic loss and at times can result in rate reductions, principal forgiveness, extensions or other actions, which may cause the related loan to be classified as a troubled debt restructuring ("tdr") and also be impaired. we use short-term (3 to 12 months) or long-term (12 to 60 months) modification programs for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as a loss mitigation strategy to improve long-term collectability of the loans that are classified as tdrs. for our credit card customers, the short-term program primarily consists of a reduced minimum payment and an interest rate reduction, both lasting for a period no longer than 12 months. the long-term program involves changing the structure of the loan to a fixed payment loan with a maturity no longer than 60 months and reducing the interest rate on the loan. the long-term program does not normally provide for the forgiveness of unpaid principal, but may allow for the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments. we also make loan modifications for some customers who request financial assistance through external sources, such as a consumer credit counseling agency program. the loans that are modified typically receive a reduced interest rate but continue to be subject to the original minimum payment terms and do not normally include waiver of unpaid principal, interest or fees. the determination of whether these changes to the terms and conditions meet the tdr criteria includes our consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.
loans classified as tdrs are recorded at their present value with impairment measured as the difference between the loan balance and the discounted present value of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the original effective interest rate of the loan. our allowance for loan losses on tdrs is generally measured based on the difference between the recorded loan receivable and the present value of the expected future cash flows.
interest income from loans accounted for as tdrs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. we accrue interest on credit card balances until the accounts are charged-off in the period the accounts become 180 days past due. the following table presents the amount of loan receivables that are not accruing interest, loans that are 90 days or more past-due and still accruing interest, and earning tdrs for the periods presented.
(1)   at december 31, 2014 and 2013, balances exclude $54 million and $70 million, respectively, of tdrs which are included in loans contractually 90 days past-due and still accruing interest balance. see note 5. loan receivables and allowance for loan losses to our consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information on the financial effects of tdrs for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

delinquencies loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables decreased with the over-30 day delinquency rate decreasing to 4.14% at december 31, 2014, as compared to 4.35% at december 31, 2013. the 21 basis point decrease compared to the same period in prior year was primarily driven by continued improvement in the u.s. economy and employment rates.
net charge-offs net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. we exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and third-party fraud losses from charge-offs. charged-off and recovered finance charges and fees are included in interest and fees on loans while third-party fraud losses are included in other expense. charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses. costs incurred to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expense and included in other expense in our consolidated and combined statements of earnings.
the table below sets forth the ratio of net charge-offs to average loan receivables, including held for sale, for the periods indicated.

allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses totaled $3,236 million at december 31, 2014 compared with $2,892 million at december 31, 2013, representing our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio. the increase in allowance for loan losses was primarily driven by an increase in our expected losses driven by growth in loan receivables.

funding, liquidity and capital resources
we maintain a strong focus on liquidity and capital. our funding, liquidity and capital policies are designed to ensure that our business has the liquidity and capital resources to support our daily operations, our business growth, our credit ratings and our regulatory and policy requirements, in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments.
funding sources prior to the ipo, we utilized related party debt provided by gecc and its affiliates as a primary funding source. in connection with the ipo, we repaid the related party debt outstanding at the date of the ipo and entered into new long-term debt arrangements with both third parties and gecc. following the ipo, our primary funding sources include cash from operations, deposits (direct and brokered deposits), third-party debt and securitized financings.
the following table summarizes information concerning our funding sources during the periods indicated:

deposits we obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers ("direct deposits") or through third-party brokerage firms that offer our deposits to their customers ("brokered deposits"). at december 31, 2014, we had $19.7 billion in direct deposits (which includes deposits from banks and financial institutions) and $15.3 billion in deposits originated through brokerage firms (including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger that channels brokerage account deposits to us). a key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to significantly expand our direct deposits base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding.
our direct deposits include a range of fdic-insured deposit products, including certificates of deposit, iras, money market accounts and savings accounts, which we offer under our optimizer+plus brand.
brokered deposits are primarily from retail customers of large brokerage firms. we have relationships with eight brokers that offer our deposits through their networks. our brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit that bear interest at a fixed rate and at december 31, 2014, had a weighted average remaining life of 3.4 years. these deposits generally are not subject to early withdrawal.
our ability to attract deposits is sensitive to, among other things, the interest rates we pay, and therefore, we bear funding and interest rate risk if we fail, or are required to pay higher rates, to attract new deposits or retain existing deposits. to mitigate these risks, we pursue a funding strategy that seeks to match our assets and liabilities by interest rate and expected maturity characteristics, and we seek to maintain access to multiple other funding sources, including securitized financings (including our undrawn committed capacity) and unsecured debt.
over the next several years, we are seeking to increase our direct deposits through investing in our direct deposit programs and capabilities. the growth of direct deposits will be supported by a significant investment in marketing and brand awareness.

securitized financings we have been engaged in the securitization of our credit card receivables since 1997. we access the asset-backed securitization market using the synchrony credit card master note trust ("mnt") (formerly the ge capital credit card master note trust) through which we issue asset-backed securities through both public transactions and private transactions funded by financial institutions and commercial paper conduits. in addition, we issue asset-backed securities in private transactions through the synchrony sales finance master trust ("sft") (formerly the ge sales finance master trust) and the synchrony receivables trust ("srt") (formerly the ge money master trust).
at december 31, 2014, we had $7.1 billion of outstanding private asset-backed securities and $7.9 billion of outstanding public asset-backed securities, in each case held by unrelated third parties.
the following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors' interests in securitized financings at december 31, 2014.
($ in millions)                                                                      less thanone year           one yearthroughthreeyears            fouryearsthroughfiveyears   after fiveyears                     total scheduled maturities of long-term borrowings-owed to securitization investors:

we retain exposure to the performance of trust assets through: (i) in the case of mnt, sft and srt, subordinated retained interests in the receivables transferred to the trust in excess of the principal amount of the notes for a given series to provide credit enhancement for a particular series, as well as a pari passu seller's interest in each trust and (ii) subordinated classes of mnt notes that we own.
all of our securitized financings include early repayment triggers, referred to as early amortization events, including events related to material breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, inability or failure of the bank to transfer loans to the trusts as required under the securitization documents, failure to make required payments or deposits pursuant to the securitization documents, and certain insolvency-related events with respect to the related securitization depositor, gecc (solely with respect to mnt) or the bank. in addition, an early amortization event will occur with respect to a series if the excess spread as it relates to a particular series falls below zero. following an early amortization event, principal collections on the loans in our trusts are applied to repay principal of the asset-backed securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund the origination activities of our business. the occurrence of an early amortization event also would limit or terminate our ability to issue future series out of the trust in which the early amortization event occurred. no early amortization event has occurred with respect to any of the securitized financings in mnt, sft or srt.
the following table summarizes for each of our trusts the three-month rolling average excess spread at december 31, 2014.
(1)   represents the excess spread (generally calculated as interest income collected from the applicable pool of loan receivables less applicable net charge-offs, interest expense and servicing costs, divided by the aggregate principal amount of loan receivables in the applicable pool) for each trust (or, in the case of mnt, represents a range of the excess spreads relating to the particular series issued within the trust), in each case calculated in accordance with the applicable trust or series documentation, for the three securitization monthly periods ending prior to december 31, 2014.
third-party debt bank term loan on august 5, 2014, we borrowed the full amount under the bank term loan with third-party lenders that provided $8.0 billion principal amount of unsecured term loans maturing in 2019. in august 2014, we prepaid $505 million of the bank term loan, using a portion of the net proceeds from our issuance of senior unsecured notes. in october 2014, we amended the bank term loan to, among other things, increase the amount of indebtedness that the company may incur by $750 million, and this amount was borrowed in full.
at december 31, 2014, the total indebtedness outstanding under the bank term loan was $8.2 billion and the weighted average interest rate was 2.06%. subsequent to december 31, 2014, we prepaid an additional $2.5 billion in the aggregate of the bank term loan, which included the use of a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes in february 2015. the total indebtedness outstanding under the bank term loan following these additional prepayments was $5.7 billion.
other than certain non-pro rata prepayments permitted to be made to gecc term loan in reliance on guidance received by synchrony, the bank or gecc from applicable bank regulatory authorities to satisfy laws, regulatory capital or liquidity requirements (including for the avoidance of doubt any regulatory requirement or condition necessary to effect the split-off or the ge slhc deregistration), voluntary prepayments of the loans outstanding under the bank term loan shall be made on a pro rata basis with the gecc term loan based on the principal amounts outstanding, respectively, at the time of such prepayment.
there are no required amortization payments or prepayments of the bank term loan, except that we are generally required to prepay the bank term loan and the gecc term loan, on a pro rata basis, with any cash proceeds received by synchrony, net of all incurred fees and expenses, from any debt securities issued by synchrony in future in excess of the following amounts, which we are entitled to retain: (i) the sum of $500 million plus 20% of any such net debt proceeds in excess of $500 million in each of 2015 and 2016; and (ii) the sum of $750 million plus 20% of any net debt proceeds in excess of $750 million in each of 2017, 2018 and 2019.
senior unsecured notes on august 11, 2014, we issued a total of $3.6 billion of senior unsecured notes with various maturities ranging from 2017 through 2024. we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of unsecured senior notes to prepay $505 million of the bank term loan. at december 31, 2014, the amount outstanding of our senior unsecured notes debt was $3.6 billion and the weighted average interest rate on the unsecured notes was 3.43%.
related party debt prior to our ipo, gecc provided the majority of our debt funding. we repaid all of our then-existing related party debt owed to gecc outstanding on the closing date of the ipo, totaling $8.0 billion, and on the closing date of the ipo, we borrowed the full amount under the gecc term loan, which provided $1.5 billion principal amount of unsecured term loan maturing in 2019. during 2014, we used the $750 million of additional borrowings under the bank term loan and a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes to make prepayments in the aggregate of $845 million of the gecc term loan, and the balance of related party debt outstanding at december 31, 2014 was $655 million.
subsequent to december 31, 2014, we made additional prepayments in the aggregate of $206 million, which included the use of a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes in february 2015. following these prepayments, the total indebtedness outstanding under the gecc term loan was $449 million. we expect that, in connection with our application to the federal reserve board and the separation, we will continue to prepay part or substantially all of the remaining outstanding related party debt owed to gecc under the gecc term loan.
other than certain non-pro rata prepayments permitted to be made to the gecc term loan in reliance on certain regulatory guidance received by synchrony, the bank or gecc as described above under "-bank term loan", all voluntary prepayments of the gecc term loan shall be made on a pro rata basis with the bank term loan. there are no required amortization/prepayments of the gecc term loan, except that we will be required to prepay the gecc term loan and the bank term loan with certain proceeds of future debt offerings as described above under "-bank term loan"
the aggregate interest and fees incurred with respect to funding provided by gecc to us was $113 million, $157 million and $155 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
short-term borrowings except as described above, there were no material short-term borrowings for the periods presented.
undrawn securitized financings at december 31, 2014, we had an aggregate of $6.1 billion of undrawn committed capacity on our securitized financings, subject to customary borrowing conditions, from private lenders under two of our existing securitization programs.
other at december 31, 2014, we had more than $25.0 billion of unencumbered assets in the bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the federal reserve board for credit at the discount window.
off-balance sheet items-guarantees we do not have any significant off-balance sheet items, including guarantees of third-party obligations. guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make a guaranteed payment or perform an obligation to a third-party based on certain trigger events. at december 31, 2014, we had not recorded any contingent liabilities in our consolidated and combined statements of financial position related to any guarantees.
covenants each of the bank term loan and the gecc term loan include: (a) affirmative covenants, which, among other things, require the bank to remain a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours and (b) negative covenants which, among other things, restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability (subject to various exceptions) to incur liens, incur indebtedness, engage in transactions with affiliates, amend or prepay the other term loan facility (except under the limited circumstances and in the manner specified in the term loan facilities), amend the master agreement and enter into certain restrictive agreements. the negative covenants also restrict our ability (subject to certain exceptions) to undergo various fundamental changes (including mergers, liquidations, sale-leaseback transactions and transfers of all or substantially all of our assets).
each of the bank term loan and the gecc term loan also contain financial covenants (to be tested on a quarterly basis) that require (i) the company and, until the company is subject to or elects to report under basel iii, the bank, to maintain a minimum tier 1 common ratio of not less than 10% (calculated in accordance with basel i or basel iii, as applicable), (ii) the company to maintain minimum liquidity of not less than $4.0 billion and (iii) the bank to maintain minimum liquidity of not less than $2.0 billion. each of the bank term loan and the gecc term loan include customary events of default, including the occurrence of a change of control (which will not be triggered by our separation from ge) and the occurrence of certain material adverse regulatory events.
the indenture pursuant to which our senior unsecured notes were issued in august 2014 includes various covenants, including covenants that restrict (subject to certain exceptions) the company's ability to dispose of, or incur liens on, any of the voting stock of the bank or otherwise permit the bank to be merged, consolidated, leased or sold in a manner that results in the bank being less than 80% controlled by us.
if we do not satisfy any of the covenants discussed above, the maturity of amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become payable. we were in compliance with all of these covenants at december 31, 2014.
our real estate leases also include various covenants, but typically do not include financial covenants. if we do not satisfy the covenants in the real estate leases, the leases may be terminated and we may be liable for damage claims. at december 31, 2014, we were not in default under any of our credit facilities and had not received any notices of default under any of our real estate leases.
credit ratings our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings of the company, the bank and the ratings of our asset-backed securities.
our senior unsecured debt issued in august 2014, was rated bbb- (stable outlook) by fitch and bbb- (stable outlook) by s&p. in addition, certain of the asset-backed securities issued by mnt are rated by fitch, s&p and/or moody's. a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. downgrades in these credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets.
liquidity
we seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations under normal and stress conditions.
we maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business, which is the responsibility of our asset and liability management committee, a subcommittee of our enterprise risk management committee. we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. we perform regular liquidity stress testing and contingency planning as part of our liquidity management process. we evaluate a range of stress scenarios including company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs.
we maintain a liquidity portfolio, which at december 31, 2014 had $12.9 billion of liquid assets, primarily consisting of cash and equivalents and short-term obligations of the u.s. treasury, less cash in transit which is not considered to be liquid, compared to a $2.1 billion liquidity portfolio at december 31, 2013. the increase in liquid assets was primarily due to the proceeds from the ipo and related debt financings, and also the retention of excess cash and equivalents from operations within our company.
as additional sources of liquidity, at december 31, 2014, we had an aggregate of $6.1 billion of undrawn committed capacity, subject to customary borrowing conditions, from private lenders under two of our existing securitization programs, and we had more than $25.0 billion of unencumbered assets in the bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the federal reserve board for credit at the discount window.
our liquidity portfolio consists of cash and equivalents primarily in the form of deposits with the federal reserve bank and short-term obligations of the u.s. treasury. as a general matter, investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid, giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash. the level and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions.
we will rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the bank for liquidity; however, bank regulations, contractual restrictions and other factors limit the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the bank may pay to us. for a discussion of regulatory restrictions on the bank's ability to pay dividends, see "item 1a. risk factors-risks relating to regulation-we and the bank are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock" and "regulation-savings association regulation-dividends and stock repurchases".
capital
our primary sources of capital have been earnings generated by our businesses and existing equity capital. the proceeds from the ipo have increased our equity capital significantly. we seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the risks of our businesses, meet regulatory requirements, adhere to rating agency targets and support future business growth. the level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments. within these constraints, we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that will provide attractive returns to our stockholders.
in connection with our separation from ge, and the related application to the federal reserve board which we will be required to make, we expect to continue to increase our capital levels by, among other things, retaining net earnings and by not paying a dividend or returning capital through stock repurchases until our application to the federal reserve board is approved. as part of our capital plan, thereafter, our board of directors intends to consider our policy for paying dividends and may consider stock repurchases. we are targeting tier 1 common ratios well in excess of regulatory "well-capitalized" levels. we measure capital ratios under the basel i framework and believe we are well positioned to manage our capital ratios as we transition to basel iii requirements in 2015.
the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors, including the financial condition, earnings, capital and liquidity requirements of us and the bank, regulatory restrictions (including any restrictions that may be imposed in connection with our separation from ge), corporate law and contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. in addition, banking laws and regulations and our banking regulators may limit our ability to pay dividends and make repurchases of our stock. for a discussion of regulatory restrictions on our and the bank's ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock, see "risk factors-risks relating to regulation-we and the bank are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock". there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends or repurchase any stock in the future.
regulatory capital requirements - synchrony financial as a savings and loan holding company, we historically have not been required to maintain any specific amount of minimum capital. beginning as early as 2015, however, we expect that we will be subject to capital requirements under the applicable u.s. basel iii capital rules. for more information, see "regulation-savings and loan holding company regulation".
the following table sets forth at december 31, 2014, the composition of our capital ratios for the company under basel i.

(1)   tier 1 leverage ratio represents total tier 1 capital as a percentage of total leveraged assets.
non-gaap measures as a new savings and loan holding company, the company historically has not been required by regulators to disclose capital ratios, and therefore, these capital ratios are non-gaap measures. we believe these capital ratios are useful measures to investors because they are widely used by analysts and regulators to assess the capital position of financial services companies, although our basel i tier 1 common ratio is not a basel i defined regulatory capital ratio, and our basel i and basel iii tier 1 common ratios may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. our basel i tier 1 common ratio is the ratio of tier 1 common equity (as calculated below) to total risk-weighted assets as calculated in accordance with the u.s. basel i capital rules. our basel iii tier 1 common ratio is the ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets, each as calculated in accordance with the u.s. basel iii capital rules (on a fully phased-in basis). our basel iii tier 1 common ratio is a preliminary estimate reflecting management's interpretation of the final basel iii capital rules adopted in july 2013 by the federal reserve board, which have not been fully implemented, and our estimate and interpretations are subject to, among other things, ongoing regulatory review and implementation guidance. the following tables set forth a reconciliation of each component of our capital ratios set forth above to the comparable gaap component at december 31, 2014.

failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. see "risk factors-risks relating to regulation-failure by synchrony, the bank and, until the ge slhc deregistration, gecc to meet applicable capital adequacy rules could have a material adverse effect on us".
in the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that require future cash payments. our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations at december 31, 2014 are summarized

(1)   savings accounts (including money market accounts), brokered network deposits sweeps, and non-interest-bearing deposits are assumed for purposes of this table to be due in 2015 because they may be withdrawn at any time without payment of any penalty.
(2)   deposits do not include interest payments because the amount and timing of these payments cannot be reasonably estimated as certain deposits have early withdrawal rights and also the option to roll interest payments into the balance. the average interest rate on our interest-bearing deposits for the year ended december 31, 2014 was 1.6%. see note 8. deposits to our consolidated and combined financial statements.
(3)   the amounts shown exclude interest as the majority of our securitized financing require payments of interest based on floating rates. the average interest rate for the year ended december 31, 2014 was 1.4%. see note 9. borrowings to our consolidated and combined financial statements.
(4)   these amounts shown exclude interest as payments of interest on these borrowings are based on floating rate. the average interest rates for the year ended december 31, 2014 were 2.4% and 2.1% for bank term loan and related party debt, respectively. see note 9. borrowings to our consolidated and combined financial statements.
(6)   the table above does not include estimated payments of liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions. the inherent complexity and uncertainty around the timing and amount of future outflows for uncertain tax positions do not permit a reasonably reliable estimate of payments, if any, to be made in connection with these liabilities. as of december 31, 2014, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $102 million, excluding related interest and penalties. see note 15. income taxes to the consolidated and combined financial statements.
critical accounting estimates
in preparing our consolidated and combined financial statements, we have identified certain accounting estimates and assumptions that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. the critical accounting estimates we have identified relate to allowance for loan losses, asset impairment, income taxes and fair value measurements. many of these estimates include determining fair value. all of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. if these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that these judgments and estimates could change, which may result in incremental losses on loan receivables, future impairments of investment securities, goodwill and intangible assets, and the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increases in our tax liabilities, among other effects. see note 2. basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated and combined financial statements, which discusses the significant accounting policies related to these estimates.
allowance for loan losses losses on loan receivables are recognized when they are incurred, which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio. the method for calculating the best estimate of probable losses takes into account our historical experience adjusted for current conditions with each product and customer type and our judgment concerning the probable effects of relevant observable data, trends and market factors.
we evaluate each portfolio quarterly. for credit card receivables, our estimation process includes analysis of historical data and there is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced by the models to determine the allowance. our risk process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations, and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or on a portfolio basis, as appropriate. more specifically, we use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency. the migration analysis considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in the loan receivables. we use other analyses to estimate losses incurred on non-delinquent accounts. the considerations in these analyses include past performance, risk management techniques applied to various accounts, historical behavior of different account vintages, current economic conditions, recent trends in delinquencies, bankruptcy filings, account collection management, policy changes, account seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates, forecasting uncertainties and a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for losses, which compares this allowance for losses to projected net charge-offs over the next 12 months, in a manner consistent with regulatory guidance. we do not evaluate credit card loans for impairment on an individual basis, but instead estimate its allowance for credit card loan losses on a portfolio basis. further, experience is not available for new portfolios; therefore, while we are developing that experience, we set loss allowances based on our experience with the most closely analogous products in our portfolio. changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for losses. it is possible that we will experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates.
asset impairment investments we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria. for debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the security, and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists, such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, including whether the issuer is in compliance with the terms and covenants of the security. quantitative criteria include determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows. for equity securities, our criteria include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position.
goodwill and intangible assets we do not amortize goodwill, but test it at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. a reporting unit is defined under gaap as the operating segment, or one level below that operating segment (the component level) if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. our operating segment consists of a single reporting unit, based on the level at which management regularly reviews and measures the business operating results.
goodwill impairment risk is first assessed under fasb accounting standards update ("asu") 2011-08, intangibles-goodwill and other (topic 350): testing goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors for our reporting unit. if potential goodwill impairment risk exists that indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we apply a two-step quantitative test. the first step compares the reporting unit's estimated fair value with its carrying value. if the carrying value of our reporting unit's net assets exceeds its fair value, the second step is applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill. if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the goodwill is considered impaired and reduced to its implied fair value. the qualitative assessment for each period presented in the consolidated and combined financial statements was performed without hindsight, assuming only factors and market conditions existing as of those dates, and resulted in no potential goodwill impairment risk for our reporting unit. consequently, goodwill was not deemed to be impaired for any of the periods presented.
definite-lived intangible assets principally consist of customer-related assets, including contract acquisitions and purchased credit card relationships. these assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. the evaluation compares the cash inflows expected to be generated from each intangible asset to its carrying value. if cash flows attributable to the intangible asset are less than the carrying value, the asset is considered impaired and written down to its estimated fair value. no impairments of definite-lived intangible assets have been recognized in the periods presented in the consolidated and combined financial statements.
income taxes we are subject to income tax in the united states (federal, state and local) as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate. our provision for income tax expense is based on our income, the statutory tax rates and other provisions of the tax laws applicable to us in each of these various jurisdictions. these laws are complex, and their application to our facts is at times open to interpretation. the process of determining our consolidated income tax expense includes significant judgments and estimates, including judgments regarding the interpretation of those laws. our provision for income taxes and our deferred tax assets and liabilities incorporate those judgments and estimates, and reflect management's best estimate of current and future income taxes to be paid. we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.
deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities, as well as the impact of tax loss carryforwards or carrybacks, and are measured using the enacted income tax laws and rates that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. deferred tax assets are specific to the jurisdiction in which they arise, and are recognized subject to management's judgment that realization of those assets is "more likely than not." in making decisions regarding our ability to realize tax assets, we evaluate all positive and negative evidence, including projected future taxable income, taxable income in carryback periods, expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and the implementation of available tax planning strategies. these decisions rely heavily on estimates. we use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight.
fasb interpretation no. 48, "accounting for uncertainty in income taxes" ("fin 48") (now part of asc 740, income taxes), establishes the framework by which we determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to be maintained for uncertain income tax positions. applying this framework, we recognize the financial statement impact of uncertain income tax positions when we conclude that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of a position, that the position will be sustained upon examination. in certain situations, we establish a liability that represents the difference between a tax position taken (or expected to be taken) on an income tax return and the amount of taxes recognized in our financial statements. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and provision for income taxes, respectively.
fair value measurements assets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period include investments in debt and equity securities. assets that are not measured at fair value every reporting period, but that are subject to fair value measurements in certain circumstances primarily include loans that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale, impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, and cost method investments that are written down to fair value when they are impaired.
assets that are written down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs. a fair value measurement is determined as the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions, weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued.
in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update ("asu") 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. the asu will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in u.s. gaap when it becomes effective. the new standard is effective on january 1, 2017. early application is not permitted. the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective (cumulative effect) transition method. we are evaluating the effect that asu 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. we have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.

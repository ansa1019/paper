the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in this report. all comparisons in the discussion are to the corresponding prior year unless otherwise stated. all amounts presented are in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), except as noted. all amounts are presented in millions of dollars, except for share data, unless otherwise indicated.
items such as income from continuing operations attributable to air products, net income attributable to air products, and diluted earnings per share attributable to air products are simply referred to as income from continuing operations, net income, and diluted earnings per share throughout this managements discussion and analysis, unless otherwise stated.
the discussion of results that follows includes comparisons to non-gaap financial measures. for 2014, the non-gaap measures exclude: business reorganization and cost reduction charges recorded in the fourth quarter, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, pension settlement losses, and impacts resulting from a tax election benefit and the chilean tax rate change. for 2013, the non-gaap measures exclude the business restructuring and cost reduction plan charges and advisory costs. for 2012, the non-gaap measures exclude the business restructuring and cost reduction plan charges, the customer bankruptcy charge, the gain on the previously held equity interest in dupont air products nanomaterials llc (da nanomaterials), the spanish tax settlement, and the spanish tax ruling. the presentation of non-gaap measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures that our management uses internally to evaluate our performance. the reconciliation of reported gaap results to non-gaap measures is presented on pages 3032. descriptions of the excluded items appear on pages 2325.
business overview air products and chemicals, inc. and its subsidiaries serve energy, electronics, chemicals, metals, and manufacturing customers globally with a unique portfolio of products, services, and solutions that include atmospheric, process and specialty gases; performance materials; equipment; and technology. geographically diverse, with operations in over 50 countries, in 2014 we had sales of $10.4 billion, assets of $17.8 billion, and a worldwide workforce of approximately 21,200 employees.
we organized our operations into four reportable business segments: merchant gases, tonnage gases, electronics and performance materials, and equipment and energy through 30 september 2014. the financial statements and analysis that follow discuss our results based on those operations. on 18 september 2014, we announced a major company reorganization effective as of 1 october 2014. refer to note 25, business segment and geographic information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments and segment reorganization beginning fiscal year 2015.
2014 in summary in 2014, we delivered sales and earnings growth driven by a strong second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. overall, sales increased by 3% including volume growth of 2% led by our merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments. volume growth was leveraged along with recent cost reduction actions to improve operating income by 6% and operating margin by 50 basis points (bp). tonnage gases results decreased versus the prior year as we completed the exit of our polyurethane intermediates business (pui) and experienced higher maintenance costs and customer outages.
we recorded a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $310.1 in our merchant gases latin america business driven by lower economic growth and profitability in our indura business and the impact of recent tax reform legislation in chile. we also recorded charges of $5.5 for pension settlements and $12.7 for severance costs related to cost reduction actions.
   sales of $10,439.0 increased 3%, or $258.6. volume growth in the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments and higher energy contractual cost pass-through to customers were partially offset by the exit from our pui business.
   operating income of $1,328.2 increased $3.8. on a non-gaap basis, operating income of $1,656.5 increased 6%, or $90.4, with higher volumes partially offset by higher energy and distribution costs and higher operating costs, including maintenance costs in the tonnage gases segment.
   we increased focus on cash flow and introduced adjusted ebitda, a non-gaap metric, in the fourth quarter. adjusted ebitda of $2,764.8 increased by $123.9, or 5%.
for a discussion of the challenges, risks, and opportunities on which management is focused, refer to our 2015 outlook discussions provided on page 21 in the managements discussion and analysis that follows.
tax election benefit                                                                      (.24    )                              (.24     )
equity affiliates income                                                                                                         (.05     )
2015 outlook for 2015, we are focused on actions that we can control to improve cash flow and drive earnings growth. we reorganized the company into new business segments effective as of 1 october 2014. our new organization should enable us to reduce costs and more effectively manage and utilize our existing assets. we also expect pricing actions to deliver improvement in our results. effectively executing on this strategy will be critical to improved results as we expect global economic growth to be modest in the year ahead.
the above guidance should be read in conjunction with the section entitled forward-looking statements.
equity affiliates income                                151.4                      167.8                           153.8
non-gaap basis adjusted ebitda                                        2,764.8                    2,640.9                         2,528.3
underlying business volume (including pui exit impact)                                                      2      %                       (1   )%
acquisitions                                                                                  %                        5    %
sales of $10,439.0 increased 3%, or $258.6. underlying business increased 2%, as higher volumes in the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments were partially offset by lower volumes in our tonnage gases segment, including the exit from our pui business which reduced sales by 1%. higher energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers increased sales by 1%. currency was flat as the impacts from a stronger euro were offset by a weaker chilean peso.
sales of $10,180.4 increased 6%, or $568.7. underlying business decreased 1%, primarily due to lower volumes resulting from our previous decision to exit the pui business and lower electronics demand, partially offset by higher volumes in the tonnage gases, performance materials, and equipment businesses. the acquisitions of indura s.a. and da nanomaterials increased sales by 5%. higher energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers increased sales by 2%.
on a gaap basis, operating income of $1,324.4 increased 3%, or $42.0. operating income in 2013 included a charge of $231.6 for a business restructuring and cost reduction plan and $10.1 for advisory costs. operating income in 2012 included a charge of $327.4 for business restructuring and cost reduction plans, a $9.8 charge for a customer bankruptcy, and the gain on the previously held equity interest in da nanomaterials of $85.9. on a non-gaap basis, operating income of $1,566.1 increased 2%, or $32.4. the increase was primarily due to acquisitions of $54, higher volumes of $24, and favorable currency translation and foreign exchange impacts of $2, partially offset by $40 from unfavorable higher energy and distribution costs net of pricing, and higher operating costs of $20,
adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as income from continuing operations excluding certain disclosed items, which the company does not believe to be indicative of ongoing business trends, before interest expense, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. we believe adjusted ebitda provides a useful operational metric for the measurement of our cash flow.
adjusted ebitda of $2,764.8 increased $123.9, or 5%, primarily due to the increase in volumes in the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments.
adjusted ebitda of $2,640.9 increased $112.6, or 4%, primarily due to acquisitions and higher volumes, partially offset by higher energy, distribution, and operating costs.
equity affiliates income
income from equity affiliates of $151.4 decreased $16.4, due to higher costs from maintenance outages and an unfavorable arbitration award, unfavorable currency impacts, and weaker oilfield services volume in mexico.
income from equity affiliates of $167.8 increased $14.0, primarily due to better performance in our mexican equity affiliate.
selling and administrative expense of $1,059.3 decreased $7.0, or 1%, as productivity, including the benefits of recent cost reduction actions, and favorable currency effects more than offset other cost increases. selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales decreased to 10.1% from 10.5%.
selling and administrative expense of $1,066.3 increased $119.5, or 13%, primarily due to the acquisition of indura s.a. selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales increased to 10.5% from 9.9%, also due to indura s.a.
research and development expense of $133.7 increased 6%, or $7.3, including the acquisition of da nanomaterials. research and development expense as a percent of sales was 1.3% in 2013 and 2012.
2014 charge on 18 september 2014, we announced plans to reorganize the company, including realignment of our businesses into new reporting segments and organizational changes, effective as of 1 october 2014. as a result of this initiative, we will incur ongoing severance and other charges. during the fourth quarter of 2014, an expense of $12.7 ($8.2 after-tax, or $.04 per share) was incurred relating to the elimination of approximately 50 positions. in 2015 and beyond, we expect the actions taken to date will provide approximately $10 in annual savings. additional charges will be recorded in future periods as the company commits to specific actions. these actions could materially impact future operating profit for the period in which the charges are recorded.
2013 plan during the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded an expense of $231.6 ($157.9 after-tax, or $.74 per share) reflecting actions to better align our cost structure with current market conditions. these charges included $100.4 for asset actions and $58.5 for the final settlement of a long-term take-or-pay silane contract primarily impacting the electronics business due to continued weakness in the pv and light-emitting diode (led) markets. in addition, $71.9 was recorded for severance, benefits, and other contractual obligations associated with the elimination of approximately 700 positions and executive changes. these reductions primarily impact our merchant gases businesses and corporate functions. the actions were in response to weaker than expected business conditions in europe and asia, reorganization of our operations and functional areas, and previously announced senior executive changes. the remaining planned actions associated with severance were completed in the first quarter of 2015 and provided approximately $45 in savings in 2014. beyond 2014, we expect these actions to provide approximately $75 in annual savings.
during the second quarter of 2012, we recorded an expense of $86.8 ($60.6 after-tax, or $.28 per share) for actions to remove stranded costs resulting from our decision to exit the homecare business, the reorganization of the merchant business, and actions taken to right size our european cost structure in light of the challenging economic outlook. the planned actions are complete and provided approximately $60 in annual savings in 2013.
during the fourth quarter of 2012, we took actions in the pui business to improve costs, resulting in a net expense of $54.6 ($34.8 after-tax, or $.16 per share), and ultimately exit the business. we completed our exit from the business in the first quarter of 2014.
during the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed an assessment of our position in the pv market, resulting in $186.0 of expense ($127.0 after-tax, or $.59 per share) primarily related to the electronics and performance materials business segment. included in the charge was an accrual of $93.5 for an offer that we made to terminate a long-term take-or-pay supply contract to purchase silane. as noted above, a final settlement was reached with the supplier in the fourth quarter of 2013.
refer to note 4, business restructuring and cost reduction actions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on these actions.
pension settlement loss our u.s. supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers, six months after the retirement date. pension settlements are recognized when cash payments exceed the sum of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year. the participants vested benefit is considered fully settled upon cash payment of the lump sum. we recognized $5.5 ($3.6 after-tax, or $.02 per share) and $12.4 ($7.8 after-tax, or $.04 per share) of settlement charges in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge in july 2012, we acquired a controlling interest in the outstanding shares of indura s.a., a latin american industrial gases company. in connection with this acquisition, we recorded $626.2 of goodwill, which was incorporated into the latin american reporting unit of our merchant gases segment. during the fourth quarter of 2014, we concluded that the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily acquired trade names) associated with this reporting unit were impaired. the indura business continues to be profitable; however, recent economic conditions in latin america, including the impact of tax legislation in chile, have been less favorable due to increasing inflation, a decline in chilean manufacturing growth, and weaker export demand for many commodities. as a result, we concluded in the fourth quarter that this business will not grow at the rate we anticipated, and we lowered our growth projections. we recorded a noncash impairment charge of $310.1 ($275.1 attributable to air products, after-tax or $1.27 per share) for the latin america reporting unit. refer to the critical accounting policies and estimates section below and note 9, goodwill, and note 10, intangible assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
2013 business combinations we completed three acquisitions in 2013. the acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations, and their results of operations were consolidated within their respective segments after the acquisition dates. the aggregate purchase price, net of cash acquired, for these acquisitions was $233.
in july 2012, we acquired a 64.8% controlling equity interest in the outstanding shares of indura s.a. following the acquisition date, 100% of the indura s.a. results are consolidated in our financial statements within the merchant gases business segment. the portion of the business that is not owned by the company is recorded as noncontrolling interests. we paid cash consideration in chilean pesos (clp) of 345.5 billion ($690) and assumed debt of clp113.8 billion ($227) for these interests. as of 30 september 2014, we hold a 67.3% interest.
da nanomaterials llc on 2 april 2012, we closed on the acquisition agreement with e.i. dupont de nemours and co., inc. to acquire their 50% interest in our joint venture, da nanomaterials. beginning in the third quarter of 2012, the results of da nanomaterials were consolidated within our electronics and performance materials business segment.
prior to the acquisition date, we accounted for our 50% interest in da nanomaterials as an equity-method investment. the year ended 30 september 2012 included a gain of $85.9 ($54.6 after-tax, or $.25 per share) as a result of revaluing our previously held equity interest to fair market value as of the acquisition date.
refer to note 5, business combinations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on these transactions.
customer bankruptcy as a result of events which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2012, we recognized a charge of $9.8 ($6.1 after-tax, or $.03 per share) primarily related to the write-off of on-site assets due to a customer bankruptcy and mill shutdown. the customer, which primarily received products from the tonnage gases segment, filed for bankruptcy in may 2012 and announced the mill shutdown in august 2012.
advisory costs during the fourth quarter of 2013, we incurred legal and other advisory fees of $10.1 ($6.4 after-tax, or $.03 per share) in connection with our response to the rapid acquisition of a large position in shares of our common stock by pershing square capital management llc and its affiliates (pershing square). these fees, which are reflected on the consolidated income statements as advisory costs, include costs incurred before and after pershing squares disclosure of its holdings and cover advisory services related to the adoption of the shareholders rights plan, preparation for a potential proxy solicitation campaign, and entering into an agreement with pershing square.
other income (expense), net items recorded to other income (expense), net arise from transactions and events not directly related to our principal income earning activities. the detail of other income (expense), net is presented in note 23, supplemental information, to the consolidated financial statements.
other income (expense), net of $52.8 decreased $17.4, primarily due to higher gains from the sale of a number of small assets and investments, higher government grants, and a favorable commercial contract settlement in the prior year. otherwise, no individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year.
other income (expense), net of $70.2 increased $23.1, primarily due to higher gains from the sale of a number of small assets and investments and a favorable commercial contract settlement, partially offset by lower government grants. otherwise, no individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year.
less: capitalized interest              33.0              25.8              30.2
interest incurred decreased $9.5. the decrease was primarily due to a lower average interest rate on the debt portfolio which reduced interest by $13, partially offset by a higher average debt balance which increased interest by $6. the change in capitalized interest was driven by a higher carrying value in construction in progress.
interest incurred increased $13.7. the increase was driven primarily by a higher average debt balance for $41, partially offset by a lower average interest rate on the debt portfolio of $24. the change in capitalized interest was driven by a decrease in project spending and a lower average interest rate.
on a gaap basis, the effective tax rate was 27.0% and 22.8% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the effective tax rate was higher in the current year primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of $305.2, which was not deductible for tax purposes, and the chilean tax reform enacted in september 2014 which increased income tax expense by $20.6. these impacts were partially offset by an income tax benefit of $51.6 associated with losses from transactions and a tax election in a non-u.s. subsidiary. the prior year rate included income tax benefits of $73.7 related to the business restructuring and cost reduction plans and $3.7 for the advisory costs. refer to note 4, business restructuring and cost reduction actions; note 9, goodwill; note 22, income taxes; and note 23, supplemental information, to the consolidated financial statements for details on these transactions. on a non-gaap basis, the effective tax rate was 24.0% and 24.2% in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
on a gaap basis, the effective tax rate was 22.8% and 21.9% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. the effective rate in 2013 includes income tax benefits of $73.7 related to the business restructuring and cost reduction plans and $3.7 for the advisory costs. the effective rate in 2012 includes income tax benefits of $105.0 related to the business restructuring and cost reduction plans, $58.3 related to the second quarter spanish tax ruling, and $3.7 related to the customer bankruptcy charge, offset by income tax expense of $43.8 related to the first quarter spanish tax settlement and $31.3 related to the gain on the previously held equity interest in da nanomaterials. refer to note 4, business restructuring and cost reduction actions; note 5, business combinations; note 22, income taxes; and note 23, supplemental information, to the consolidated financial statements for details on these transactions. on a non-gaap basis, the effective tax rate was 24.2% in both 2013 and 2012.
in 2012, we sold the majority of our homecare business to the linde group for sale proceeds of 590 million ($777) and recognized a gain of $207.4 ($150.3 after-tax, or $.70 per share). in addition, an impairment charge of $33.5 ($29.5 after-tax, or $.14 per share) was recorded to write down the remaining business, which was primarily in the united kingdom and ireland, to its estimated net realizable value. in 2013, we recorded an additional charge of $18.7 ($13.6 after-tax, or $.06 per share) to update our estimate of the net realizable value. in 2014, a gain of $3.9 was recognized for the sale of the remaining homecare business and settlement of contingencies on the sale to the linde group.
refer to note 3, discontinued operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on this business.

in the u.s. and canada, sales increased 7%, with volumes up 3% and price up 4%. volumes increased as higher liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon volumes were partially offset by lower helium volumes due to supply limitations. volumes also increased as a result of our epco carbondioxide products, inc. acquisition. pricing was higher due to improved pricing in liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen, and helium.
in europe, sales increased 4%, with favorable currency impacts of 4%, primarily from the euro and the pound sterling. volumes were flat as higher volumes in liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon were offset by lower helium volumes and lower cylinder volumes as construction remains weak.
in asia, sales increased 4% due to higher volumes of 5%, partially offset by lower pricing of 1%. volumes increased with higher liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon volumes across the region, partially offset by lower helium volumes. pricing decreased as higher helium pricing was more than offset by lower pricing in liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon, particularly in china, driven in part by a higher mix of wholesale customers.
merchant gases equity affiliates income of $140.1 decreased $4.9, primarily from unfavorable currency impacts in mexico, south africa, and india and lower oilfield services volume in mexico.
underlying sales increased 1% due to higher pricing of 1%. the acquisition of indura s.a. had a favorable impact on sales of 11%.
in the u.s. and canada, sales increased 5%, with volumes up 2% and price up 3%. volumes increased primarily due to higher liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen, partially offset by helium supply limitations. in europe, sales decreased 3%, with volumes down 3% primarily due to overall economic weakness in the region. in asia, sales increased 3% due to higher volumes of 2% and favorable currency of 2%, partially offset by lower pricing of 1%. volumes increased primarily due to higher liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen volumes.
operating income increased 6%, primarily due to higher acquisitions of $48 and lower operating costs of $13, partially offset by lower price recovery of power and fuel costs of $25 and lower volumes of $10. the lower operating costs included the impact from the prior year cost reduction plan in europe, partially offset by higher pension costs.
operating income in 2013 also included $10 for gains from sales of assets and investments. operating margin decreased 100 bp, primarily due to the impact of the indura s.a. acquisition and higher power and fuel costs.
merchant gases equity affiliates income of $145.0 increased $7.9, primarily as a result of improved performance in our mexican equity affiliate.
volumes decreased 7%, as strong demand in the united states gulf coast hydrogen system was more than offset by lower volumes in latin america and the exit from our pui business. the lower pui volumes decreased sales by 4%. as of the end of the first quarter of 2014, our exit from the pui business was complete. higher energy contractual cost pass-through to customers increased sales by 3%. currency favorably impacted sales by 1%.
volumes decreased 1%, as the impact from implementation of our previous decision to exit the pui business was partially offset by the impact of new plants. higher energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers increased sales by 6%. currency favorably impacted sales by 1%.
acquisitions                                                                                               %                        2   %
sales decreased 3%, as lower volumes of 4% and lower pricing of 1% were partially offset by acquisitions of 2%. electronics sales decreased 8%, as weaker materials volumes and equipment sales were partially offset by the acquisition of da nanomaterials. performance materials sales increased 2%, as higher volumes of 4% were partially offset by lower pricing of 2%. the increase in volumes was primarily due to strength in the automobile and u.s. housing markets partially offset by weaker volumes to certain construction markets and marine coatings. the lower pricing was primarily due to unfavorable mix impacts.
operating income of $321.3 decreased 25%, or $104.3, and operating margin of 14.3% decreased 400 bp, as 2012 included a gain on the previously held equity interest in da nanomaterials of $85.9. on a non-gaap basis, operating income of $321.3 decreased 5%, or $18.4, primarily from unfavorable price and mix impacts of $15, lower volumes of $9, and higher operating costs of $4 partially offset by higher acquisitions of $6 and favorable currency of $4. operating margin decreased 30 bp, primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable price mix.
sales of $450.4 were relatively flat as higher liquefied natural gas (lng) project activity was offset by lower air separation (asu) project activity. operating income of $88.2 increased from the higher lng project activity.
the sales backlog for the equipment business at 30 september 2014 was $520, compared to $402 at 30 september 2013. the increase was primarily due to new lng orders as global project development activity remains high. it is expected that approximately $320 of the backlog will be completed during 2015.
sales of $451.1 increased primarily from higher lng project activity. operating income of $65.5 increased from the higher lng project activity.
other other operating income (loss) primarily includes other expense and income that cannot be directly associated with the business segments, including foreign exchange gains and losses. also included are lifo inventory valuation adjustments, as the business segments use fifo, and the lifo pool valuation adjustments are not allocated to the business segments. other also included stranded costs resulting from discontinued operations, as these costs were not reallocated to the businesses in 2012.
reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures the discussion of our annual results includes comparisons to non-gaap financial measures, including adjusted ebitda. the presentation of non-gaap measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures which our management uses internally to evaluate our operating performance and cash flow.
definitions of non-gaap measures may not be comparable to similar definitions used by other companies and are not a substitute for similar gaap measures. in 2013, we had pension settlement losses of $12.4 ($7.8 after-tax, or $.04 per share). in 2012, our income tax provision was unfavorably impacted by $14.1 ($.07 per share) due to changes in the chilean tax rate. these impacts were included in non-gaap operating performance measures in their respective years.

liquidity and capital resources we maintained a strong financial position throughout 2014. we continue to have consistent access to commercial paper markets, and cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.
as of 30 september 2014, we had $330.3 of foreign cash and cash items compared to a total amount of cash and cash items of $336.6. if the foreign cash and cash items are needed for operations in the u.s. or we otherwise elect to repatriate the funds, we may be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes on a significant portion of these amounts. however, since we have significant current investment plans outside the u.s., it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items outside the u.s. current financing alternatives do not require the repatriation of foreign funds.
our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities of continuing operations, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table:
operating activities                  $2,186.4                $1,553.1               $1,765.1
investing activities                  (1,638.0   )            (1,697.0   )           (2,435.2   )
financing activities                    (504.3   )               115.4                  (78.4   )
operating activities for the year ended 2014, cash provided by operating activities was $2,186.4. income from continuing operations of $987.1 reflected the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $310.1. income from continuing operations is adjusted for other noncash items that include depreciation and amortization, undistributed earnings of equity affiliates, share-based compensation expense, and noncurrent capital lease receivables. other adjustments included a source of cash of $143.2 for pension and other postretirement expense, partially offset by a use of cash of $78.2 for pension contributions. the working capital accounts were a use of cash of $246.5. inventory was a use of cash of $23.5 primarily due to the timing of helium purchases from the u.s. bureau of land management. the reduction of payables and accrued liabilities of $234.8 includes $148.5 for payments associated with projects accounted for as capital leases and $52.5 of payments related to the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan.
for the year ended 2013, cash provided by operating activities was $1,553.1. income from continuing operations of $1,004.2 reflected the write-down of long-lived assets associated with business restructuring of $100.4. the other adjustments included a use of cash of $300.8 for pension contributions, partially offset by $178.2 of pension and other postretirement expense. the working capital accounts were a use of cash of $207.8. the reduction of accrued liabilities of $130.3 includes $185.8 for payments made in relation to the 2012 business restructuring and cost reduction plans, including the settlement of a long-term take-or-pay silane contract. these payments were partially offset by a $69.7 net increase to accrued liabilities for the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan.
for the year ended 2012, cash provided by operating activities was $1,765.1. income from continuing operations of $999.2 reflected the noncash gain on the previously held equity interest in da nanomaterials of $85.9, the write-down of long-lived assets associated with restructuring and a customer bankruptcy of $80.2, and a noncash tax benefit of $58.3 recognized as a result of the second quarter spanish tax ruling. the working capital accounts were a source of cash of $100.1. the provision for the business restructuring and cost reduction plans resulted in an increase to accrued liabilities of $223.9, partially offset by a use of cash of $32.9 for payments made in relation to these plans.
investing activities for the year ended 30 september 2014, cash used for investing activities was $1,638.0, primarily capital expenditures for plant and equipment. for the year ended 30 september 2013, cash used for investing activities was $1,697.0, primarily capital expenditures for plant and equipment and acquisitions. for the year ended 30 september 2012, cash used for investing activities was $2,435.2, primarily capital expenditures for plant and equipment, acquisitions, and investments in unconsolidated affiliates. refer to the capital expenditures section below for additional detail.
capital expenditures capital expenditures are detailed in the following table:
additions to plant and equipment                                    $1,684.2                $1,524.2                $1,521.0

capital expenditures on a gaap basis                                $1,682.2                $1,747.8                $2,559.8
capital lease expenditures (a)                                         202.4                   234.9                   212.2
capital expenditures on a non-gaap basis                            $1,885.1                $1,996.7                $2,778.3
(a)                                                we utilize a non-gaap measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities, if the arrangement qualifies as a capital lease. additionally, the payment for subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and will be reflected as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. the presentation of this non-gaap measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure that our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures.
capital expenditures on a gaap basis in 2014 totaled $1,682.2, compared to $1,747.8 in 2013. the decrease of $65.6 was primarily due to the acquisitions in 2013. additions to plant and equipment are largely in support of the merchant gases and tonnage gases businesses. additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements. spending in 2014 and 2013 included plant and equipment constructed to provide oxygen for coal gasification in china, hydrogen to the global market, and renewable energy in the u.k.
in 2013, we completed three acquisitions with an aggregate cash use, net of cash acquired, of $224.9. in the fourth quarter, we acquired an air separation unit and integrated gases liquefier in guiyang, china. during the third quarter, we acquired epco, the largest independent u.s. producer of liquid carbon dioxide (co2), and wcg.
in 2012, we acquired a controlling stake in indura s.a. for $690 and e.i. dupont de nemours and co., inc.s 50% interest in our joint venture, da nanomaterials for $147. we also purchased a 25% equity interest in abdullah hashim industrial gases & equipment co. ltd. (ahg), an unconsolidated affiliate, for $155.
refer to note 5, business combinations, and note 7, summarized financial information of equity affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the acquisitions and the investments.
capital expenditures on a non-gaap basis in 2014 totaled $1,885.1 compared to $1,996.7 in 2013. capital lease expenditures of $202.4 decreased by $32.5, reflecting lower project spending.
2015 outlook excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2015 on a gaap basis are expected to be between $1,650 and $1,800, and on a non-gaap basis are expected to be between $1,700 and $1,900. the non-gaap capital expenditures include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases, which are expected to be between $50 and $100. a majority of the total capital expenditures is expected to be for new plants. it is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with cash from continuing operations. in addition, we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and investments in equity affiliates.
financing activities for the year ended 2014, cash used by financing activities was $504.3 primarily attributable to cash used to pay dividends of $627.7, which was partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $141.6. our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net source of cash (issuance) of $1.1 and included $148.7 of net commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances, debt proceeds from the issuance of a
for the year ended 2013, cash provided by financing activities was $115.4. our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net source of cash (issuance) of $927.4 and included $437.7 of net commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances and the issuances of a 300 million ($397) 2.0% eurobond on 7 august 2013, and a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 2.75% note on 4 february 2013, which were partially offset by the repayment of a $300.0 senior fixed-rate 4.15% note on 1 february 2013. proceeds from stock option exercises provided cash of $226.4. the primary uses of cash were to purchase 5.7 million shares of treasury stock for $461.6 and to pay dividends of $565.6.
for the year ended 2012, cash used for financing activities was $78.4. our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net source of cash (issuance) of $419.6 and included the issuances of a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 3.0% note on 3 november 2011 and a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 1.2% note on 13 september 2012, which were partially offset by the repayment of a 4.25% eurobond of $400.3 on 10 april 2012. proceeds from stock option exercises provided an additional $124.3 source of funds. dividends paid to shareholders were a use of cash of $514.9.
discontinued operations for the year ended 2014, cash used by discontinued operations was $146.6 and primarily included a payment made to the linde group for contingent proceeds we were obligated to return from the sale of our homecare business. for the year ended 2013, cash provided by discontinued operations was $13.1. for the year ended 2012, the sale of our european homecare business to the linde group generated proceeds of $776.6 and included the contingent proceeds that we returned in 2014. refer to note 3, discontinued operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
financing and capital structure capital needs in 2014 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations. at the end of 2014, total debt outstanding was $6,118.5 compared to $6,273.6 at the end of 2013, and cash and cash items were $336.6 compared to $450.4 at the end of 2013. total debt at 30 september 2014 and 2013, expressed as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt plus total equity plus redeemable noncontrolling interest), was 43.9% and 45.3%, respectively.
proceeds from long-term debt were $461.0. this included the issuance of a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 3.35% note on 31 july 2014 that matures on 31 july 2024, which was issued for general corporate purposes. refer to note 14, debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
during fiscal 2013, we entered into a five-year $2,500.0 revolving credit agreement maturing 30 april 2018 with a syndicate of banks (the 2013 credit agreement), under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the company and certain of its subsidiaries. effective 30 june 2014, the 2013 credit agreement was amended to increase the facility to $2,595.0. the 2013 credit agreement provides a source of liquidity for the company and supports its commercial paper program. this credit facility includes a financial covenant for a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization (total debt plus total equity plus redeemable noncontrolling interest) no greater than 70%. no borrowings were outstanding under the 2013 credit agreement as of 30 september 2014.
effective 11 june 2012, we entered into an offshore chinese renminbi (rmb) syndicated credit facility of rmb1,000.0 million ($160.9) that was to mature in june 2015. on 20 march 2014, we repaid the outstanding balance of rmb250.0 million ($40.2) and terminated the credit facility. additional commitments totaling $189.7 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $180.6 was borrowed and outstanding at 30 september 2014.
as of 30 september 2014, we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements.
as of 30 september 2014, we classified our 3.875% eurobond of 300 million ($378.9) maturing in march 2015 as long-term debt because we have the ability to refinance the debt under the 2013 credit agreement. our current intent is to refinance this debt via the u.s. or european public or private placement markets.
2015 outlook cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. we project a modest need to access the long-term debt markets in 2015, primarily to refinance maturing long-term debt. we expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants. also, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper and other short-term debt markets.
contractual obligations we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts, such as debt agreements, lease agreements, unconditional purchase obligations, and other long-term obligations. the following table summarizes our obligations as of 30 september 2014:
payments due by period total      2015                2016              2017              2018              2019                     thereafter long-term debt obligations debt maturities                           $4,890                $444              $411              $425              $449              $423                 $2,738
capital leases                                 4                   1                 1                 1                                                        1
unconditional purchase obligations         1,548                 929               154                81                65                63                    256
long-term debt obligations the long-term debt obligations include the maturity payments of long-term debt, including current portion, and the related contractual interest obligations. refer to note 14, debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long-term debt.
contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the long-term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. we had $1,168 of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 september 2014, excluding fixed-rate debt that has been swapped to variable-rate debt. the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 september 2014. variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by u.s. short-term tax-exempt interest rates.
leases refer to note 11, leases, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases.
pension obligations the amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities. refer to note 15, retirement benefits, to the consolidated financial statements. these payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment.
the total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets, continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions.
unconditional purchase obligations approximately $650 of our long-term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous hyco (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. the price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas. however, long-term take-or-pay sales contracts to hyco customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. due to the matching of most long-term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts, we do not believe these
purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. refer to note 16, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our unconditional purchase obligations.
the unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations, which are primarily pass-through contracts with our customers. in addition, purchase commitments to spend approximately $700 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2015.
we also purchase materials, energy, capital equipment, supplies, and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations. the majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy, which are obtained under requirements-type contracts at market prices.
income tax liabilities noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 september 2014 were $995.5. tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 september 2014 were $108.7. these tax liabilities were excluded from the contractual obligations table, as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year given that payments will vary according to changes in tax laws, tax rates, and our operating results. in addition, there are uncertainties in timing of the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions with respective taxing authorities. refer to note 22, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
put options we have an outstanding put option agreement with the largest minority shareholder of our indura s.a. subsidiary. the put option gives the shareholder the ability to require us to purchase up to a 30.5% equity interest during the two-year period beginning on 1 july 2015 based on pricing terms in the agreement. refer to note 16, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. we anticipate that this option will be exercised sometime during the two-year period; however given the uncertainty in timing of exercise; we have excluded the payment from the contractual obligations table. as of 30 september 2014, the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest is $287.2.
pension benefits we sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees. the principal defined benefit pension plansthe u.s. salaried pension plan and the u.k. pension planwere closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans. over the long run, the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions.
for 2014, the fair market value of pension plan assets for our defined benefit plans as of the measurement date increased to $4,114.6 from $3,800.8 in 2013. the projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was $4,738.6 and $4,394.0 in 2014 and 2013, respectively. refer to note 15, retirement benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits.
the decrease in pension expense, excluding special items, was primarily attributable to the 60 bp increase in weighted average discount rate, resulting in lower amortization of actuarial losses. the decrease was partially offset by unfavorable impacts associated with changes in mortality assumptions. special items of $5.8 primarily included $5.5 for pension settlement losses and $.3 for special termination benefits, a portion of which relates to the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan.
the increase in pension expense, excluding special items, was primarily attributable to the 100 bp decrease in weighted average discount rate, resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses. the increase was partially offset
by a higher than expected return on plan assets and contributions in 2013. special items of $19.8 primarily included $12.4 for pension settlement losses and $6.9 for special termination benefits relating to the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan.
2015 outlook pension expense is estimated to be approximately $110 to $115, excluding special items, in 2015, a decrease of $15 to $20 from 2014, resulting primarily from favorable asset experience, partially offset by a decrease in discount rates. pension settlement losses of $25 to $35 are expected, dependent on the timing of retirements. in 2015, we expect pension expense to include approximately $123 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to $114 in 2014. net actuarial losses of $104 were recognized in 2014, resulting primarily from an approximately 60 bp decrease in the weighted average discount rate, partially offset by actual asset returns above expected returns. actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets, different from expected returns, would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2015.
pension funding pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are primarily non-qualified plans. with respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses.
in addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. with the assistance of third party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. during 2014 and 2013, our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $78.2 and $300.8, respectively. contributions for 2013 included voluntary contributions for u.s. plans of $220.0.
for 2015, cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $130 to $150. the increase from prior year is driven primarily by benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are dependent upon the timing of retirements and actions to reorganize the business. actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. refer to the contractual obligations discussion on page 36 for a projection of future contributions.
environmental matters we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations. compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. in the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act (cercla: the federal superfund law); resource conservation and recovery act (rcra); and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note 1, major accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note 16, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.
the amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled $35.1, $37.1, and $44.7 in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet internal company standards. future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts. refer to note 16, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
although precise amounts are difficult to determine, we estimate that we spent $5 and $4 in 2014 and 2013, respectively, on capital projects to control pollution. capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately $5 in both 2015 and 2016.
we accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $86 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $99 as of 30 september 2014. the consolidated balance sheets at 30 september 2014 and 2013 included an accrual of $86.2 and $86.7, respectively. the accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the pace, florida; piedmont, south carolina; paulsboro, new jersey; and pasadena, texas, locations is included in these amounts. refer to note 16, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities.
actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year.
some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases (ghg). these include existing and expanding coverage under the european union emissions trading scheme and californias cap and trade scheme; mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in alberta, canada; and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions in ontario, canada, and south korea. in addition, the u.s. environmental protection agency is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. at the u.s. state level, californias cap and trade program rules have been officially adopted, and our compliance obligation as a hydrogen producer began 1 january 2013. we have been able to mitigate some of the costs through our contractual terms.
increased public awareness and concern may result in more international, u.s. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg. although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production, and fluorinated gases production. we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through our contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we operate prevents accurate prediction of the long-term impact on us. any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions from our facilities could impact our growth by increasing our operating costs or reducing demand for certain of our products.
regulation of ghg may also produce new opportunities for us. we continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency, and lower emissions. we are also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere, enable cleaner transportation fuels, and facilitate alternate fuel source development. in addition, the potential demand for clean coal and our carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen, one of our main products, and our proprietary technology for delivering low-cost oxygen.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in note 16, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. we are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. our off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
related party transactions our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business. we did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arms length with clearly independent parties.
inflation we operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates. the ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations. it is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis.
critical accounting policies and estimates note 1, major accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies. judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas. however, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires managements significant judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee.
depreciable lives of plant and equipment net plant and equipment at 30 september 2014 totaled $9,532.1, and depreciation expense totaled $914.8 during 2014. plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life.
economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location.
the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. for example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. in these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis.
we have numerous long-term customer supply contracts, particularly in the gases on-site business within the tonnage gases segment. these contracts principally have initial contract terms of 15 to 20 years. there are also long-term customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the electronics and performance materials segment. these contracts principally have initial terms of 10 to 15 years. additionally, we have several customer supply contracts within the equipment and energy segment with contract terms that are primarily five to 10 years. the depreciable lives of assets within this segment can be extended to 20 years for certain redeployable assets. depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term contracts are matched to the contract lives. extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. as contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the physical life of the asset.
the depreciable lives of production facilities within the merchant gases segment are principally 15 years. customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term. the depreciable lives of production facilities within the electronics and performance materials segment, where there is not an associated long-term supply agreement, range from 10 to 15 years. these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors actions, etc. management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change.
a change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments for which there is not an associated long-term customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below:
impairment of assets plant and equipment plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets.
if such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. if an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset groups fair value and its carrying value. an estimate of the asset groups fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows. assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
the assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent managements best estimates at the time of the impairment review. factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing
we tested the recoverability of latin america long-lived assets and concluded that they were recoverable from expected future undiscounted cash flows.
goodwill the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity. goodwill was $1,237.3 as of 30 september 2014. disclosures related to goodwill are included in note 9, goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements.
we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. the tests are done at the reporting unit level, which is defined as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. as of 30 september 2014, we had four business segments and thirteen reporting units. reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment. the majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments.
as part of the goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit, or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a two-step quantitative test is required. we chose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing, as further described below.
the first step of the quantitative test requires that we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying value, including assigned goodwill. to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we initially use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of estimated future cash flows. our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple. the income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capital-intensive nature, the long-term contractual nature of our business, and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units. the principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates, operating profit margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. projected revenue growth rates and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and long-term financial planning process. the discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate, reflects expected long-term growth rates. if our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment, we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment. when the market approach is utilized, fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects. when both the income and market approach are utilized, we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting. management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates.
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. in the second step, the reporting units fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in an analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. if the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss.
we conducted our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter. other than our latin america reporting unit within the merchant gases segment, we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore there were no indications of impairment. the latin america reporting unit is composed predominately of our indura business, with assets and goodwill associated with operations in chile and other latin american countries. recently, economic conditions in latin america, including
the impact of tax legislation in chile, have been less favorable due to increasing inflation, a decline in chilean manufacturing growth, and weaker export demand for many commodities. as a result, we lowered growth projections for our latin america reporting unit and determined that the associated goodwill was impaired. in the fourth quarter, we recorded a noncash impairment charge of $305.2. refer to note 9, goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
other than latin america, the excess of fair value over carrying value for our reporting units ranged from approximately 35% to approximately 175%. in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculation on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of these reporting units. in this scenario, the fair value of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying value by a range of approximately 20% to 150%.
due to the reorganization of our business effective as of 1 october 2014, we conducted an additional impairment test on our existing reporting units as of 30 september 2014. the fair value of all of our reporting units except latin america substantially exceeded their carrying value at 30 september 2014. the fair value of the latin america reporting unit at 30 september was estimated based on a similar outlook and assumptions as those used for the 1 july 2014 testing, and the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value due primarily to depreciation and amortization and the impact of the chilean tax rate change. as of 30 september 2014, the carrying value of latin america goodwill was $232.7. if economic conditions in the latin america operating environment deteriorate further or the business fails to perform as expected, an additional review of goodwill recoverability may be warranted.
future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to: decline in market share, pricing pressures, inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures, increases to our cost of capital, and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses. negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in additional impairment charges.
intangible assets intangible assets with determinable lives at 30 september 2014 totaled $541.2 and consisted primarily of customer relationships, purchased patents and technology, and land use rights. these intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. see the impairment discussion above under plant and equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined.
indefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 september 2014 totaled $74.6 and consisted of trade names and trademarks. indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. if the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. to determine fair value, we utilize the royalty savings method, a form of the income approach. this method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset.
in the fourth quarter of 2014, we conducted our annual impairment test and determined that our indefinite-lived intangible assets were impaired. refer to note 10, intangible assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
equity investments investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $1,257.9 at 30 september 2014. the majority of our investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in note 7, summarized financial information of equity affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.
based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee. changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge.
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate. at 30 september 2014, accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to $78.0 and $806.1, respectively. tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 september 2014 were $108.7, excluding interest and penalties. income tax expense for the year ended 30 september 2014 was $366.0. disclosures related to income taxes are included in note 22, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements.
actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. we believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments.
deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. however, when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense.
pension and other postretirement benefits the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans.
actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern.
several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. we determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. note 15, retirement benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the domestic and international plans. the actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. we believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. however, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. our mortality assumptions are currently aligned with the irs mortality assumption used to determine funding valuations. in october 2014, the society of actuaries published new mortality tables. while the irs is not expected to adopt the new tables until 2017, we have begun to evaluate the potential impact of these tables on future periods.
one of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate. this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments are matched against the returns of high-quality corporate bonds over the same time period to determine an overall effective discount rate. the rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. this rate will change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. a 50 bp increase/decrease in the discount rate decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $21 per year.
the expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated long-term returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets. in determining asset class returns, we take into account historical long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. a 50 bp increase/decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $17 per year.
we use a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans. investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return based on plan assets. the expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets, which is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a five-year period from the year in which they occur, which reduces year-to-year volatility. the market-related value for fixed income investments is the actual fair value. expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets.
loss contingencies in the normal course of business we encounter contingencies, i.e., situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us. we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. when only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in note 1, major accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and particulars are provided in note 16, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. as additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. for example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, or our proportionate share is increased. similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded.

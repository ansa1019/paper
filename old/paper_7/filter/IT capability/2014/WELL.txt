item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of health care reit, inc. for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this annual report on form 10-k. other important factors are identified in "item 1 - business" and "item 1a - risk factors" above.
executive summary company overview health care reit, inc. is a real estate investment trust ("reit") that has been at the forefront of seniors housing and health care real estate since the company was founded in 1970.  we are an s&p 500 company headquartered in toledo, ohio. our portfolio spans the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real estate, including seniors housing communities, long-term/post-acute care facilities, medical office buildings, inpatient and outpatient medical centers and life science facilities. our capital programs, when combined with comprehensive planning, development and property management services, make us a single-source solution for acquiring, planning, developing, managing, repositioning and monetizing real estate assets.
medical facilities                       4,078,358                     17.8%                      241
(1) excludes our share of investments in unconsolidated entities. entities in which we have a joint venture with a minority partner are shown at 100% of the joint venture amount.
business strategy our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. we seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in net operating income and portfolio growth. to meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location.
substantially all of our revenues are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees and services, and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable. these items represent our primary sources of liquidity to fund distributions and depend upon the continued ability of our obligors to make contractual rent and interest payments to us and the profitability of our operating properties. to the extent that our customers/partners experience operating difficulties and become unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. to mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. our proactive and comprehensive asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections, and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. our internal property management division actively manages and monitors the medical office building portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of, among other things, tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs, and market conditions. in monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze property-specific data. additionally, we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends.  we evaluate the operating environment in each property's market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility.  when we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. through these efforts, we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.
in addition to our asset management and research efforts, we also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk. operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit. in addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, rental income and resident fees represented 42% and 57% respectively, of total revenues (including discontinued operations).  substantially all of our operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations payments due for the period. our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments.
our primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts, resident fees and services, borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility, public issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses and general and administrative expenses.  depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash.
we also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments.  new investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment dispositions. our investments generate cash from net operating income and principal payments on loans receivable. permanent financing for future investments, which generally replaces funds drawn under our primary unsecured credit facility, has historically been provided through a combination of the issuance of public debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt.
depending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. it is also possible that investment dispositions may occur in the future. to the extent that investment dispositions exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. we expect to reinvest the proceeds from any investment dispositions in new investments. to the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our primary unsecured credit facility. at december 31, 2014, we had $473,726,000 of cash and cash equivalents, $79,697,000 of restricted cash and $2,428,723,000 of available borrowing capacity under our primary unsecured credit facility.
capital market outlook the capital markets remain supportive of our investment strategy. for the year ended december 31, 2014, we raised $3.2 billion in aggregate gross proceeds through the issuance of common stock and unsecured debt. the capital raised, in combination with available cash and borrowing capacity under our primary unsecured credit facility, supported $3.7 billion in gross new investments for the year. we expect attractive investment opportunities to remain available in the future as we continue to leverage the benefits of our relationship investment strategy.
capital.  in may 2014, we completed the public issuance of 16,100,000 shares of common stock for approximate gross proceeds of $1,003,835,000.  in september 2014, we completed the public issuance of 17,825,000 shares of common stock for approximate gross proceeds of $1,136,344,000.  also, for the year ended december 31, 2014, we raised $257,055,000 through our dividend reinvestment program.  in july 2014, we closed on a new primary unsecured credit facility that includes a $2,500,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility, a $500,000,000 unsecured term credit facility and a $250,000,000 canadian-denominated unsecured term credit facility. among other things, the primary unsecured credit facility provides us with additional borrowing capacity and extends the agreement to october 31, 2018.  it can be extended for an additional year at our option. in november 2014, we issued £500,000,000 of 4.5% 20-year senior unsecured notes, generating approximately $773,992,000 of net proceeds.

key performance indicators, trends and uncertainties we utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business. these indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance, credit strength and concentration risk.  management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results, in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes.
operating performance. we believe that net income attributable to common stockholders ("nics") is the most appropriate earnings measure. other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations ("ffo"), net operating income from continuing operations ("noi") and same store cash noi ("sscnoi"); however, these supplemental measures are not defined by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap"). please refer to the section entitled "non-gaap financial measures" for further discussion and reconciliations of ffo, noi and sscnoi. these earnings measures and their relative per share amounts are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies. the following table reflects the recent historical trends of our operating performance measures for the periods presented (in thousands):
credit strength. we measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. the leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term debt. the coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges (interest, secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends). we expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain compliance with our debt covenants. the coverage ratios are based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("adjusted ebitda") which is discussed in further detail, and reconciled to net income, below in "non-gaap financial measures." leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, investment recommendations and rating of companies. the following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures for the periods presented:

we evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with current expectations to determine if historical trends are indicative of future results. our expected results may not be achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. factors that may cause actual results to differ from expected results are described in more detail in "item 1 - business - cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements" and "item 1a - risk factors" and other sections of this annual report on form 10-k. management regularly monitors economic and other factors to develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize our competitive position. our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and company-specific trends. please refer to "item 1 - business," "item 1a - risk factors" and "item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion of these risk factors.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate governance maintaining investor confidence and trust is important in today's business environment. our board of directors and management are strongly committed to policies and procedures that reflect the highest level of ethical business practices. our corporate governance guidelines provide the framework for our business operations and emphasize our commitment to increase stockholder value while meeting all applicable legal requirements. these guidelines meet the listing standards adopted by the new york stock exchange and are available on the internet at www.hcreit.com/investor-relations/governance.  the information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10-k, and our web address is included as an inactive textual reference only.

on may 4, 2012, we filed an open-ended automatic or "universal" shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission covering an indeterminate amount of future offerings of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants and units. as of january 31, 2015, we had an effective registration statement on file in connection with our enhanced dividend reinvestment plan under which we may issue up to 10,000,000 shares of common stock. as of january 31, 2015, 3,016,824  shares of common stock remained available for issuance under this registration statement. we have entered into separate equity distribution agreements with each of ubs securities llc, rbs securities inc., keybanc capital markets inc. and credit agricole securities (usa) inc. relating to the offer and sale from time to time of up to $630,015,000 aggregate amount of our common stock ("equity shelf program"). as of january 31, 2015, we had $457,112,000 of remaining capacity under the equity shelf program. depending upon market conditions, we anticipate issuing securities under our registration statements to invest in additional properties and to repay borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility.

during the past three years, inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate. additionally, our earnings are primarily long-term investments with predictable rates of return. these investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity, senior unsecured notes, secured debt and borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility. during inflationary periods, which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates, our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs. presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and long-term interest rates do not increase significantly, we believe that inflation will not impact the availability of equity and debt financing for us.
we evaluate our business and make resource allocations on our three business segments: seniors housing triple-net, seniors housing operating and medical facilities. the primary performance measures for our properties are noi and sscnoi, which are discussed below.  please see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

the increase in rental income is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of new properties, the transition of 38 properties from our seniors housing operating segment and the conversion of newly constructed seniors housing triple-net properties from which we receive rent. certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant's properties.  these escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period.  if gross operating revenues at our facilities and/or the consumer price index do not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase.  sales of real property would offset revenue increases and, to the extent that they exceed new acquisitions, could result in decreased revenues.  our leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income.  for the three months ended december 31, 2014, we had no lease renewals but we had 12 leases with rental rate increasers ranging from 0.14% to 0.33% in our seniors housing triple-net portfolio.  the increase in interest income is attributable to investments in new loans and draws on existing loans in the current year (see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information).
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we completed four seniors housing triple-net construction projects representing $71,569,000 or $185,896 per bed/unit plus expansion projects totaling $18,053,000. the following is a summary of seniors housing triple-net construction projects pending as of december 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands):

total interest expense represents secured debt interest expense and interest expense on capital lease obligations offset by interest allocated to discontinued operations. the change in secured debt interest expense is due to the net effect and timing of assumptions, segment transitions, extinguishments and principal amortizations. the following is a summary of our seniors housing triple-net secured debt principal activity (dollars in thousands):

depreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of new property acquisitions and the conversions of newly constructed properties. to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly.
transaction costs represent costs incurred with property acquisitions (including due diligence costs, fees for legal and valuation services, and termination of pre-existing relationships computed based on the fair value of the assets acquired), lease termination fees and other similar costs.
the increase in other expenses is primarily related to the reversal of the indemnification asset recorded in connection with the genesis acquisition.  an income tax benefit was recorded in the same amount to reverse the unrecognized tax benefits related to the transaction.  please refer to note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december 31,
during the year ended december 31, 2012, we wrote off one loan related to an entrance fee community.  during the year ended december 31, 2013, we wrote off one loan related to an active adult community.  during the year ended december 31, 2014, we did not record a provision for loan loss or have any loan write-offs.  the provision for loan losses is related to our critical accounting estimate for the allowance for loan losses and is discussed in "critical accounting policies" and note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.
a portion of our seniors housing triple-net properties were formed through partnerships. income or loss from unconsolidated entities represents our share of net income or losses from partnerships where we are the noncontrolling partner. net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners' share of net income relating to those partnerships where we are the controlling partner.

fluctuations in revenues and property operating expenses are primarily a result of acquisitions subsequent to january 1, 2012, partially offset by the transition of 38 properties to seniors housing triple-net on september 1, 2013. interest income for the years ended december 31, 2012 and 2013 relates to the sunrise loan funded during the three months ended december 31, 2012 and acquired in january 2013 (please refer to note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information). the fluctuations in depreciation and amortization are due to the net impact of acquisitions and variations in amortization of short-lived intangible assets. to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, these amounts will change accordingly. losses from unconsolidated entities are primarily attributable to depreciation and amortization of short-lived intangible assets related to our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures with chartwell in 2012, sunrise in 2013 and senior resource group in 2014.

the fluctuations in gains/losses on debt extinguishments is primarily attributable the volume of extinguishments and terms of the related secured debt. derivative gains relate primarily to foreign currency forward exchange contracts entered into in conjunction with international investments made during the respective years.  please refer to note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
transaction costs represent costs incurred with property acquisitions (including due diligence costs, fees for legal and valuation services, and termination of pre-existing relationships computed based on the fair value of the assets acquired), lease termination fees and other similar costs. the change in transaction costs from year to year is primarily a function of investment volume. the majority of our seniors housing operating properties are formed through partnership interests. net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners' share of net income or loss related to those partnerships where we are the controlling partner.

the increase in rental income is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of new properties and the conversion of newly constructed medical facility properties from which we receive rent. certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index.  these escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period.  if the consumer price index does not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase.  sales of real property would offset revenue increases and, to the extent that they exceed new acquisitions, could result in decreased revenues.  our leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income.  for the three months ended december 31, 2014, our consolidated medical office building portfolio signed 72,159 square feet of new leases and 251,399 square feet of renewals.  the weighted-average term of these leases was six years, with a rate of $26.25 per square foot and tenant improvement and lease commission costs of $21.23 per square foot.  substantially all of these leases during the referenced quarter contain an annual fixed or contingent escalation rent structure ranging from the change in cpi to 4%.

the increases in property operating expenses and depreciation and amortization are primarily attributable to acquisitions and construction conversions of new medical facilities for which we incur certain property operating expenses offset by discontinued operations.
transaction costs represent costs incurred with property acquisitions (including due diligence costs, fees for legal and valuation services, and termination of pre-existing relationships computed based on the fair value of the assets acquired), lease termination fees and other similar costs.  the fluctuations in transaction costs are primarily due to acquisition volume fluctuations in the relevant years.
income from unconsolidated entities represents our share of net income or losses related to our joint venture investment with forest city enterprises and certain unconsolidated property investments related to our strategic joint venture relationship with a national medical office building company. the decrease is primarily attributable to lower occupancy in the current year.

the change in interest expense on senior unsecured notes is due to the net effect of issuances and extinguishments, excluding our sterling-denominated senior unsecured notes, both of which are in our seniors housing operating segment.  please refer to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.  we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used for the construction of properties owned directly by us. the amount capitalized is based upon the balances outstanding during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of financing. our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized.  the change in capitalized interest is due to both changes in construction fundings and in our weighted-average cost of financing.  please see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our interest rate swap agreements and their impact on interest expense.  loan expense represents the amortization of deferred loan costs incurred in connection with the issuance and amendments of debt. loan expense changes are due to amortization of charges for costs incurred in connection with senior unsecured note issuances.  the change in interest expense on our primary unsecured credit facility is due primarily to the net effect and timing of draws, paydowns and variable interest rate changes.  please refer to note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our primary unsecured credit facility.

other non-gaap financial measures we believe that net income, as defined by u.s. gaap, is the most appropriate earnings measurement. however, we consider ffo to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with u.s. gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. however, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. in response, the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for reits that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. ffo, as defined by nareit, means net income attributable to common stockholders, computed in accordance with u.s. gaap, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairment of depreciable assets, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests.
net operating income from continuing operations ("noi") is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties. we define noi as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses.  property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing tenants for our seniors housing operating and medical facility properties.  these expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance.  general and administrative expenses represent costs unrelated to property operations or transaction costs.  these expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits, professional services, office expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets.  same store cash noi ("sscnoi") is used to evaluate the cash-based operating performance of our properties under a consistent population which eliminates changes in the composition of our portfolio.  as used herein, same store is generally defined as those revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the full three year reporting period.  any properties acquired, developed, transitioned or classified in discontinued operations during that period are excluded from the same store amounts.  we believe noi and sscnoi provide investors relevant and useful information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. we use noi and sscnoi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties.
ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. we believe that ebitda, along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities, is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. we primarily utilize ebitda to measure our interest coverage ratio, which represents ebitda divided by total interest, and our fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents ebitda divided by fixed charges. fixed charges include total interest, secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends.
a covenant in our primary unsecured credit facility contains a financial ratio based on a definition of ebitda that is specific to that agreement. failure to satisfy these covenants could result in an event of default that could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. due to the materiality of these debt agreements and the financial covenants, we have disclosed adjusted ebitda, which represents ebitda as defined above and adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, provision for loan losses and gain/loss on extinguishment of debt. we use adjusted ebitda to measure our adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents adjusted ebitda divided by fixed charges on a trailing twelve months basis. fixed charges include total interest (excluding capitalized interest and non-cash interest expenses), secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends. our covenant requires an adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.50 times.
other than adjusted ebitda, our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions. additionally, these measures are utilized by the board of directors to evaluate management. adjusted ebitda is used solely to determine our compliance with a financial covenant in our primary unsecured credit
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations facility and is not being presented for use by investors for any other purpose. none of our supplemental measures represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with u.s. gaap and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. finally, the supplemental measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies.
the table below reflects the reconciliation of ffo to net income attributable to common stockholders, the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure, for the periods presented. the provisions for depreciation and amortization include provisions for depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations. noncontrolling interest and unconsolidated entity amounts represent adjustments to reflect our share of depreciation and amortization.  amounts are in thousands except for per share data.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions.  management considers accounting estimates or assumptions critical if:
·         the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and
·         the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them.  management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future.  however, since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, they bear the risk of change.  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.  please refer to note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us. there were no material changes to these policies in 2014.
the following table presents information about our critical accounting policies, as well as the material assumptions used to develop each estimate:

allowances or placement on non-accrual status may be required. a loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement. consistent with this definition, all loans on non-accrual are deemed impaired. to the extent circumstances improve and the risk of collectability is diminished, we will return these loans to full accrual status.

in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires that revenue be recognized after   we evaluate collectability based on assumptions and other considerations four basic criteria are met. these four criteria include persuasive evidence    including, but not limited to, the certainty of payment, payment history, the of an arrangement, the rendering of service, fixed and determinable income      financial strength of the investment's underlying operations as measured by and reasonably assured collectability. if the collectability of revenue is      cash flows and payment coverages, the value of the underlying collateral and determined incorrectly, the amount and timing of our reported revenue could     guaranties and current economic conditions.
be significantly affected. interest income on loans is recognized as earned     if our evaluation based upon the principal amount outstanding subject to an evaluation of         indicates that collectability is not reasonably assured, we may place an collectability risk. substantially all of our operating leases contain fixed    investment on non-accrual or reserve against all or a portion of current and/or contingent escalating rent structures. leases with fixed annual rental   income as an offset to revenue.
escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. we recognize resident fees and services, other than move-in fees, monthly as services are provided. lease agreements with residents generally have a term of one year and are cancelable by the resident with 30 days' notice.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a)
in this report, "occidental" means occidental petroleum corporation (opc), or opc and one or more entities in which it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries). occidental's principal businesses consist of three segments. the oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (ngls) and natural gas. the chemical segment (oxychem) mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls. the midstream, marketing and other segment (midstream and marketing) gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, ngls, natural gas, carbon dioxide (co2) and power. it also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity, and trades oil, ngls, gas and power. additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.
strategy general through its operations, occidental aims to maximize total returns to stockholders using the following strategies:
ø   increase oil and gas segment production through development programs focused on large, long-lived conventional and unconventional oil and gas assets with long-term growth potential, and acquisitions;
ø   allocate and deploy capital with a focus on achieving returns well in excess of its cost of capital;
in conducting its business, occidental accepts commodity, engineering and limited exploration risks. capital is employed to operate all assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner. occidental seeks to limit its financial and political risks.
the fourth quarter of 2014 saw a sharp decline in oil and ngls prices. price volatility is inherent in the oil and gas business, and in order to manage this risk, occidental maintains a low debt to capitalization ratio and retains sufficient cash on hand. occidental will focus on lowering its costs which over time management believes will correlate to increasing and decreasing oil prices.
with respect to the strategic initiatives announced last year, occidental has:
ø   completed the separation of its california assets, leading to the creation of california resources corporation (california resources), an independent, publicly traded company;
ø   sold its interests in the hugoton field, resulting in proceeds of $1.3 billion;
ø   sold a portion of its interest in plains gp holdings (plains pipeline) for proceeds of $1.7 billion while continuing to hold an approximate 13 percent interest; and
ø   sold its interest in the bridgetex pipeline, resulting in proceeds of $1.1 billion while maintaining access to united states gulf markets through this pipeline.
as a result of these strategic initiatives, occidental ended the year with $7.8 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, which exceeds its long-term debt of $6.8 billion.
the following describes the application of occidental's overall strategy to each of its operating segments:
ø   focusing a sizable portion of occidental's drilling activities on unconventional opportunities, primarily in the permian basin; and
ø   maintaining a disciplined approach towards domestic acquisitions and divestitures and the execution of international contracts, with an emphasis on creating value and further enhancing occidental's existing positions.
over the past several years, occidental built a large portfolio of growth-oriented assets in the united states. in 2014, occidental spent a much larger portion of its investment capital on the development of this portfolio. acquisitions in 2014 were approximately $1.6 billion, and comprised mainly of permian basin properties. this acquisition activity reflects occidental's strategy to capitalize on the opportunities presented by its existing portfolio of assets and strong balance sheet.
management believes occidental's oil and gas segment growth will occur primarily through exploitation and development opportunities in the permian basin and focused international projects in the middle east.
chemical the primary objective of oxychem is to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve above-cost-of-capital returns. the chemical segment's strategy is to be a low-cost producer in order to maximize its cash flow generation. oxychem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with chlorine, which is co-produced with caustic soda, and markets both to third parties. in addition, chlorine, together with ethylene, is converted through a series of intermediate products into pvc. oxychem's focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale. capital is employed to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets. acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor-alkali and pvc businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities. in early 2014, oxychem completed construction and began operating a 182,500 ton-per-year membrane chlor-alkali plant in tennessee and, through a 50/50 joint venture with mexichem s.a.b. de c.v., broke ground on a 1.2 billion pound-per-year ethylene cracker at the oxychem ingleside facility. the joint venture provides an opportunity to capitalize on the advantage that u.s. shale gas development has presented to u.s. chemical producers by providing low-cost ethane as a raw material
and is expected to begin operating in 2017. in the third quarter, oxychem completed construction and began operating a 162,000 tons per year hydrochloric acid synthesis unit at its existing niagara falls, n.y. facility.
midstream and marketing the midstream and marketing segment strives to maximize realized value by optimizing use of its assets, including its transportation and storage capacity, and by providing access to multiple markets. in order to generate returns, the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to other occidental segments as well as third parties. the segment invests in and operates gas plants, co-generation facilities, pipeline systems and storage facilities. the segment also seeks to minimize the costs of gas, power and other commodities used in occidental's businesses, while limiting credit risk exposure. capital is employed to sustain or, where appropriate, increase operational and transportation capacity and to improve the competitiveness of occidental's assets. during 2014, occidental sold its interest in bridgetex pipeline while retaining access to united states gulf markets through the pipeline, resulting in a $633 million pre-tax gain. the bridgetex pipeline transports crude oil between the permian region and the united states gulf coast refinery markets and began service in the second half of 2014. simultaneously with the sale of occidental's interest in the bridgetex pipeline, occidental completed the sale of a portion of its investment in plains pipeline, resulting in a $1.4 billion pre-tax gain.
key performance indicators general occidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success in its key performance metrics that drive total stockholder return. in addition to production growth and capital allocation and deployment discussed above, occidental believes the following are its most significant metrics:
ø   return on equity (roe) and return on capital employed (roce);
ø   segment specific measures such as per-unit profit, production cost, cash flow, finding and development costs and reserves replacement percentages; and
debt structure in 2014, occidental decreased its debt balance by $101 million. the debt-to-capitalization (debt and equity) ratio was 16 percent and 14 percent as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
prices and differentials can vary significantly, even on a short-term basis, making it impossible to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty.
operations domestic interests occidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases, subsurface mineral rights it owns or a combination of both surface land and subsurface mineral rights it owns. occidental's domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to ten years, which is extended through the end of production once it commences. of the total 4.5 million net acres in which occidental has interests, approximately 87 percent is leased, 12 percent is owned subsurface mineral rights and 1 percent is owned land with mineral rights.
occidental has interests that are operated under pscs or similar contracts in bahrain, iraq, libya, oman, qatar and yemen. under such contracts, occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain production costs and an additional share for profit. in addition, certain contracts in colombia are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a psc. these contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on occidental's economic interest as defined in the contracts. occidental's share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline. overall, occidental's net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher.

2.   midcontinent and other interests permian basin occidental's permian basin production is diversified across a large number of producing areas. the basin extends throughout southwest texas and southeast new mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the united states, accounting for approximately 16 percent of the total united states oil production. occidental is the largest operator and the largest producer of oil in the permian basin with an approximate 13 percent net share of the total oil production in the basin. occidental also produces and processes natural gas and ngls in the basin.
occidental manages its permian basin operations through two business units: permian resources, which includes growth-oriented unconventional opportunities and permian eor (enhanced oil recovery), which utilizes enhanced oil recovery techniques such as; co2 floods and waterfloods. during 2014, capital efficiency efforts reduced drilling costs per well by 8 percent for the permian basin operations. in addition, management began transitioning to a horizontal drilling program to take advantage of shale and other unconventional opportunities. in the permian basin, occidental spent over $2.6 billion of capital in 2014 with 73 percent spent on permian resources assets. in 2015, permian basin capital spending is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion. approximately 78 percent of the total capital to be spent in the permian basin is planned for permian resources assets to focus on growing oil production.
occidental's permian resources operations are among its fastest-growing assets and held approximately 2.5 million net acres at the end of 2014, including acreage with prospective resource potential. the development program, largely began in 2010, continued to increase in 2014, accounting for 280 wells drilled. in 2014, permian resources drilled 167 horizontal wells and expects to drill the same number of horizontal wells in 2015. permian resources has a sizeable inventory of wells to develop with economic returns in a low price environment. continued completion optimization, the application of enhanced manufacturing principles, combined with expected commercial savings is expected to increase the well inventory even further. production from this business unit comes from approximately 13,000 gross wells, of which 61 percent are operated by other producers. on a net basis,
permian eor operates a combination of co2 floods and waterfloods which have similar development characteristics and ongoing monitoring and maintenance requirements. due to a unique combination of characteristics, the permian basin has been a leader in the implementation of co2 enhanced oil recovery projects. the permian basin's concentration of large conventional reservoirs, favorable co2 flooding performance and the proximity to naturally occurring co2 supply has resulted in decades of steady growth in enhanced oil production. with over 30 active floods and 40 years of experience, permian eor is the industry leader in permian basin co2 flooding.
numerous projects have demonstrated that co2 injection can increase the recovery from permian basin reservoirs by more than 25 percent. significant opportunity remains to expand occidental's existing projects into new portions of reservoirs. occidental operates reservoirs that thus far have only been water flooded, leaving opportunity for significant additional recovery with new co2 injection. hence, even small improvements in recovery efficiency can add significant reserves. technology improvements, such as the recent trend towards vertical expansion of the co2 flooded interval into residual oil zone targets continue to yield more recovery from existing projects. over the last few years, occidental has had an ongoing program of deepening wells, with 109 wells deepened in 2014 and 81 wells planned in 2015. occidental utilizes work-over rigs to drill the extra depth into additional co2 floodable sections of the reservoir. these are low cost projects which can add reserves even in a low price environment. permian eor has a large inventory of future co2 projects which could be developed over the next 20 years or accelerated, depending on market conditions.
the current strategy for permian eor is to invest sufficient capital to maintain current production thereby providing cash flow after capital to support growth in permian resources. by exploiting natural synergies between permian eor and permian resources, occidental is able to deliver unique advantages, efficiencies and expertise across its permian basin operations. occidental's share of production in the permian basin was approximately 222,000 boe per day in 2014 with 75,000 boe per day coming from permian resources and 147,000 boe per day from permian eor.
midcontinent and other in april 2014, occidental sold its hugoton field operations in kansas, oklahoma, and colorado for $1.3 billion and recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of $531 million.
other developments during the fourth quarter of 2014, commodity prices declined significantly causing occidental to assess the carrying value of its domestic producing assets and assess development plans for its non-producing assets. in the fourth quarter of 2014, occidental recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $2.7 billion in the williston basin, $904 million related to its gas and ngls assets and $589 million for other domestic acreage. in the second quarter of 2014, occidental also recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $471 million for certain non-producing domestic acreage that management decided not to pursue. any further sustained declines in commodity prices may result in additional impairments in the future.
6.   united arab emirates
7.   yemen bahrain in 2009, occidental and other consortium members began operating the bahrain field under a 20-year development and production sharing agreement (dpsa). occidental has a 48-percent working interest in the joint venture. since handover of operations, the consortium has increased gross gas production capacity 50 percent from an initial level of 1.5 billion cubic feet per day to over 2.3 billion cubic feet per day and increased gross oil production from 26,000 barrels per day to more than 44,000 barrels per day. occidental's share of production from bahrain during 2014 was approximately 236 million cubic feet (mmcf) of gas per day and 4,000 barrels of oil per day.
occidental has been pursuing opportunities to adjust terms of the dpsa to more accurately reflect current operating and economic challenges under the contract. however, occidental has not yet been successful in obtaining these concessions. due to deteriorating market conditions, occidental has recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $801 million for its investments in bahrain.
iraq in 2010, occidental and other consortium members signed a 20-year contract with the south oil company of iraq to develop the zubair field. in 2013, the terms were improved reflecting a reduction in the targeted production level to 850,000 boe per day and a five-year extension to 2035. occidental's interest in this contract entitles occidental to receive oil for cost recovery and a remuneration fee. delays in implementation of development plans have limited the amount of production from iraq. occidental does not know when development activities will reach desired levels. occidental's share of production from iraq was approximately 13,000 boe per day in 2014.
libya occidental participates with the libyan national oil company in the sirte basin producing operations. these agreements continue through 2032. in 2014, occidental suspended exploration activities due to civil unrest in the country. production disruptions continued throughout 2014 due to oil field and export terminal strikes and closures. occidental does not know when operations will return to normal levels. the 2014 production volumes were insignificant.
oman in oman, occidental is the operator of block 9 and block 27, with a 65-percent working interest in each block; block 53, with a 45-percent working interest; and block 62, with a 48-percent working interest.
the term for block 9 continues through december 2015, with a 10-year extension right for certain areas, subject to government approval. the term for block 27 expires in 2035.
a 30-year psc for the mukhaizna field (block 53) was signed with the government of oman in 2005, pursuant to which occidental assumed operation of the field. by the end of 2014, occidental had drilled more than 2,400 new wells and continued implementation of a major steamflood project. in 2014, the average gross daily production was 122,000 boe per day, which was over 15 times higher than the production rate in september 2005 when occidental assumed operations.
in 2008, occidental was awarded a 20-year contract for block 62, subject to declaration of commerciality, where it is pursuing development and exploration opportunities targeting gas and condensate resources. in 2014, occidental signed a five year extension for the initial phase for the discovered non associated gas area (natural gas not in contact with crude oil in a reservoir) for block 62.
qatar in qatar, occidental is the operator at idd el shargi north dome (isnd) and idd el shargi south dome (issd), with a 100-percent working interest in each, and al rayyan (block 12), with a 92.5-percent working interest. the terms for isnd, issd and block 12 expire in 2019, 2022 and 2017, respectively.
occidental's dolphin investment comprises two separate economic interests through which occidental owns: (i) a 24.5-percent undivided interest in the upstream operations under a dpsa with the government of qatar to develop and produce natural gas and ngls in qatar's north field through mid-2032, with a provision to request a five-year extension; and (ii) a 24.5-percent interest in the stock of dolphin energy limited (dolphin energy), which operates a pipeline and is discussed further in "midstream and marketing segment - pipeline transportation."
united arab emirates in 2011, occidental acquired a 40-percent participating interest in the al hosn gas project, joining with the abu dhabi national oil company (adnoc) in a 30-year joint venture agreement. once fully operational, the project is anticipated to produce over 450 mmcf per day of natural gas and 75,000 barrels per day of ngls and condensate, of which occidental's net share would be over 180 mmcf per day and 30,000 barrels per day, respectively. initial start up of production from this project commenced in january 2015 and is proceeding as planned.
additionally, the al hosn gas project includes gas processing facilities which are discussed further in "midstream and marketing segment - gas processing plants and co2 fields and facilities".
occidental conducts a majority of its middle east business development activities through its office in abu dhabi, which also provides various support functions for occidental's middle east/north africa oil and gas operations.
yemen in yemen, occidental owns interests in block 10 east shabwa field, which extends through december 2015 with a 40.4-percent interest that includes an 11.8-percent interest held in an unconsolidated entity, and block s-1 an nagyah field, which is an occidental-operated block with a 75-percent working interest that extends into 2023.
given the political instability and civil unrest in yemen, production levels may be unpredictable for the remainder of the block 10 contract term and it is unlikely the contract will be extended. occidental's share of production from the yemen properties was approximately 10,000 boe per day in 2014.
colombia occidental has a working interest in the la cira-infantas area and has operations within the llanos norte basin. occidental's interests range from 39 to 61 percent and certain interests expire between 2023 and 2030, while others extend through the economic limit of the areas. occidental's share of production was approximately 27,000 boe per day in 2014.
proved reserves proved oil, ngls and gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements. oil, ngls and gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity, quality and transportation costs. for the 2014, 2013 and 2012 disclosures, the calculated average west texas intermediate oil prices were $94.99, $96.94 and $94.71 per barrel, respectively. the calculated average brent oil prices for 2014, 2013 and 2012 disclosures were $99.51, 108.76, and $111.70 per barrel, respectively. the calculated average henry hub gas prices for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $4.42, $3.65 and $2.79 per mmbtu, respectively.
occidental does not have any reserves from non-traditional sources. for further information regarding occidental's proved reserves, see "supplemental oil and gas information" following the "financial statements."
proved reserve additions occidental's total proved reserve additions from all sources were 380 million boe in 2014, and included 337 million boe from occidental's development program net of revisions of prior estimates, and 43 million boe from purchases.
the total additions were as follows:
total additions                       380
occidental's ability to add reserves, other than through purchases, depends on the success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects, each of which depends on reservoir characteristics, technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices, as well as capital and operating costs. many of these factors are outside management's control, and will affect whether these historical sources of proved reserve additions continue at similar levels. occidental's 2014 development program provided approximately 265 million boe of reserve additions domestically.
improved recovery in 2014, occidental added proved reserves of 354 million boe from improved recovery through its eor and infill drilling activities. generally, the improved recovery additions in 2014 were mostly associated with the continued development of properties in the permian basin. these properties comprise both conventional projects, which are characterized by the deployment of eor development methods, largely employing application of co2 flood, waterflood or steam flood, and unconventional projects. these types of conventional eor development methods can be applied through existing wells, though additional drilling is frequently required to fully optimize the development configuration. waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells. the use of either co2 or steam flooding depends on the geology of the formation, the evaluation of engineering data, availability and cost of either co2 or steam and other economic factors. both techniques work similarly to lower viscosity causing the oil to move more easily to the producing wells. many of occidental's projects, including unconventional projects, rely on improving permeability to increase flow in the wells. in addition, some improved recovery comes from drilling infill wells that allow recovery of reserves that would not be recoverable from existing wells.
extensions and discoveries occidental also added proved reserves from extensions and discoveries, which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs. in 2014, extensions and discoveries added 41 million boe related primarily to the recognition of proved undeveloped reserves from the permian basin and oman.
purchases of proved reserves occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at prices it deems reasonable. as market conditions change, the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly. in 2014, occidental added 43 million boe through purchases of proved reserves largely consisting of domestic acquisitions mainly in the permian basin.
revisions of previous estimates revisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic, production decline or operating performance data. in addition, product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by occidental. for example, higher prices may increase the economically recoverable reserves, particularly for domestic properties, because the extra margin extends the expected life of the operations. offsetting this effect, higher prices decrease occidental's share of proved reserves under pscs because less oil is required to recover costs. conversely, when prices drop, occidental's share of proved reserves increases for pscs and economically recoverable reserves may drop for other operations. in 2014, revisions of previous estimates provided a decrease of 58 million boe to proved reserves. occidental had positive technical revisions of 7 million boe which exclude the impact of negative revisions in bahrain of 54 million boe and price revisions of 11 million boe.
reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data.
proved undeveloped reserves in 2014, occidental had proved undeveloped reserve additions of 328 million boe from improved recovery, extensions and discoveries and purchases. of the total additions, 284 million boe represented additions from improved recovery, primarily in the permian basin. occidental added 15 million boe through domestic acquisitions, mainly in the permian basin. additionally, the proved undeveloped reserves increased 29 million boe due to extensions and discoveries mainly in oman and the permian basin. these proved undeveloped reserve additions were offset by transfers of 315 million boe to the proved developed category as a result of the 2014 development programs including 214 million boe from al hosn gas project reserves. occidental incurred approximately $1.7 billion in 2014 to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. al hosn, permian basin, oman, williston basin and south texas accounted for approximately 93 percent of the reserve transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed in 2014. a substantial portion of the proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31, 2014 was the result of the development program in the permian basin, which represents 55 percent of total year-end proved undeveloped reserves.
recent global economic conditions have driven oil and gas prices down significantly. these conditions may continue for an extended period. prolonged or further declines in commodity prices could require occidental to further reduce capital spending, potentially impacting either the quantity or the development timing of proved undeveloped reserves.
reserves evaluation and review process occidental's estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of december 31, 2014, were made by occidental's technical personnel and are the responsibility of management. the estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by occidental to develop the reserves. this process involves reservoir engineers, geoscientists, planning engineers and financial analysts. as part of the proved reserves estimation process, all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates, operating costs and capital expenditures. price differentials between benchmark prices (the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year) and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves. production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods, including estimates from decline curve analysis, type-curve analysis, material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes, seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance. these field-tested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities.
net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor. net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
the current senior vice president, reserves for oxy oil and gas is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates, in compliance with u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) rules and regulations, including the internal audit and review of occidental's oil and gas reserves data. the senior vice president has over 30 years of experience in the upstream sector of the exploration and production business, and has held various assignments in north america, asia and europe. he is a
three-time past chair of the society of petroleum engineers oil and gas reserves committee. he is an american association of petroleum geologists (aapg) certified petroleum geologist and currently serves on the aapg committee on resource evaluation. he is a member of the society of petroleum evaluation engineers, the colorado school of mines potential gas committee and the unece expert group on resource classification. he is also an active member of the joint committee on reserves evaluator training (jcoret). the senior vice president has bachelor of science and master of science degrees in geology from emory university in atlanta.
occidental has a corporate reserves review committee (reserves committee), consisting of senior corporate officers, to review and approve occidental's oil and gas reserves. the reserves committee reports to the audit committee of occidental's board of directors during the year. since 2003, occidental has retained ryder scott company, l.p. (ryder scott), independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes.
in 2014, ryder scott conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by occidental's engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of december 31, 2014, in accordance with the sec regulatory standards. ryder scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of occidental's 2014 year-end total proved reserves portfolio. in 2014, ryder scott reviewed approximately 24 percent of occidental's proved oil and gas reserves. since being engaged in 2003, ryder scott has reviewed the specific application of occidental's reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 72 percent of occidental's existing proved oil and gas reserves. management retains ryder scott to provide objective third-party input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to occidental's reserve estimation and reporting process. ryder scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by occidental. occidental has filed ryder scott's independent report as an exhibit to this form 10-k.
based on its reviews, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by occidental, ryder scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current sec regulations.
industry outlook the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to various market conditions. the wti and brent oil price indexes declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014, settling at $53.27 per barrel and $57.33 per barrel from $98.42 per barrel and $110.80 per barrel, respectively, as of december 31, 2014 and 2013.
oil prices will continue to be affected by: (i) global supply and demand, which are generally a function of global economic conditions, inventory levels, production disruptions, technological advances, regional market conditions and the actions of opec, other significant producers and governments; (ii) transportation capacity, infrastructure constraints, and cost in producing areas; (iii) currency exchange rates; and (iv) the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions.
ngls prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids. some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock. in addition, infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region.
domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals, as well as government regulations and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas.
these and other factors make it impossible to predict the future direction of oil, ngls and domestic gas prices reliably. international gas prices are generally fixed under long-term contracts. occidental continues to respond to economic conditions by adjusting capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital.
chemical segment business environment the modest pace of united states economic growth resulted in slightly higher demand for domestically produced energy and feedstocks. chlorovinyl margins were challenged throughout the year as unprecedented unplanned and planned ethylene cracker outages significantly affected the supply of ethylene resulting in historically high ethylene prices. chemical segment earnings, excluding asset impairments in 2014 and the gain on sale of the investment in carbocloro in 2013, decreased in 2014, primarily due to higher energy and ethylene costs and lower chlor-alkali pricing driven by continued unfavorable supply and demand fundamentals.
business review basic chemicals during 2014, the united states economy continued its slow recovery with full-year growth expected to show only a slight improvement from the prior year. the improvement to the economy contributed to moderate improvements in domestic chemical demand. despite the commissioning of three chlor-alkali plants in the u.s., including oxychem's 182,500 ton-per-year membrane plant in tennessee, industry chlorine operating rates remained relatively flat
with 2013 at approximately 84 percent, which resulted in chlorine prices ending approximately 6 percent below where they began. exports of downstream chlorine derivatives into the vinyls chain were competitive for the first half of 2014 but were negatively impacted by a significant increase in ethylene prices as third quarter supply was restricted by historically high ethylene cracker plant outages. liquid caustic soda prices experienced downward price pressure during the first quarter as the industry absorbed the additional chlor-alkali capacity that came on-line. export demand and pricing remains under pressure due to global over capacity and lower growth in major consuming regions such as latin american and asia. businesses such as calcium chloride, potassium hydroxide and muriatic acid improved compared to 2013 as domestic demand improved and margins remained stable throughout the year.
vinyls domestic pvc demand in 2014 grew by approximately 3 percent compared to 2013 as the housing and commercial construction markets continued their recovery. despite the improvement in the domestic market, the industry operating rate decreased by slightly more than 2 percent due to a combination of industry outages early in 2014 and export demand declining by approximately 10 percent compared to the prior year. industry margins improved in 2014 due to first quarter pvc price increases, which were partially offset by higher ethylene prices. during the first half of 2014, north america ethane-based ethylene production continued to be price advantaged over europe and asia, but is reaching parity with the rest of the world as the price of oil declines. despite the year-over-year reduction in north american exports of pvc, export volumes represented nearly 30 percent of total pvc sales of north american producers. construction commenced on the ingleside, texas, ethylene cracker during the first half of 2014 and commercial operations are expected to begin in early 2017.
basic chemicals occidental expects that if the united states housing, automotive and durable goods markets continue to improve, domestic demand for basic chemical products should be higher in 2015. overall, the increase in chlor-alkali capacity may restrict significant price improvement but anticipated higher demand from strengthening global markets coupled with lower natural gas prices should allow for moderate chlorine and caustic soda margin improvement in 2015. the continued competitiveness of downstream chlorine derivatives in global markets is contingent on united states feedstock costs, primarily natural gas and ethylene, remaining favorable compared to other feedstock costs in global markets.
midstream and marketing segment business environment midstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its marketing and trading businesses and its processing, transportation and power generation assets. the marketing and trading businesses aggregate and market occidental's and third-party volumes, trade commodities and engage in storage activities. marketing and trading performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs. processing and transportation results are affected by the volumes that are processed and transported through the segment's plants and pipelines, as well as the margins obtained on related services.
business review marketing and trading the marketing and trading group markets substantially all of occidental's oil, ngls and gas production, trades around its assets, including its own and third party transportation and storage capacity, and engages in commodities trading. occidental's third-party marketing and trading activities focus on purchasing oil, ngls and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets. these purchases allow occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets. marketing performance in 2014 declined compared to 2013 due to lower margins on crude oil and ngls, partially offset by higher margins in natural gas. in the second half of 2014, occidental commenced winding down its phibro commodity trading operations. as of year-end there was no material exposure related to phibro's remaining activities.
gas processing plants and co2 fields and facilities occidental processes its and third-party domestic wet gas to extract ngls and other gas byproducts, including co2, and delivers dry gas to pipelines. margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for ngls. occidental's 2014 earnings from these operations increased compared to 2013, due to the multiple plant turnarounds in the permian basin operations during 2013.
occidental, together with adnoc, completed the al hosn gas processing facilities in abu dhabi at the end of 2014. the al hosn gas processing facilities are designed to process 1.0 bcf per day of natural gas and separate it into sales gas, condensate, ngls and sulfur. the al hosn gas processing facilities includes processing and treatment facilities, sulfur recovery units, including facilities to extract sulfur from natural gas and to load and store sulfur. the project is anticipated to produce approximately 8,700 tons per day of sulfur, of which occidental's share would be 3,500 tons of sulfur per day. the al hosn gas processing facilities will generate revenues from gas processing fees and the sale of sulfur.
pipeline transportation margin and cash flow from pipeline transportation operations mainly reflect volumes shipped. dolphin energy owns and operates a 230-mile-long, 48-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline (dolphin pipeline), which transports dry natural gas from qatar to the uae and oman. the dolphin pipeline contributes significantly to occidental's pipeline transportation results through occidental's 24.5-percent interest in dolphin energy. the dolphin pipeline has capacity to transport up to 3.2 bcf of natural gas per day and currently transports approximately 2.3 bcf per day. dolphin pipeline is currently expanding gas compression facilities to achieve maximum pipeline capacity. occidental believes substantial opportunities remain to provide gas transportation to additional customers in the region to reach the full capacity of the dolphin pipeline and generate additional midstream revenues and cash flows.
occidental owns an oil common carrier pipeline and storage system with approximately 2,900 miles of pipelines from southeast new mexico across the permian basin of southwest texas to cushing, oklahoma. the system has a current throughput capacity of about 720,000 barrels per day, 6.0 million barrels of active storage capability and 108 truck unloading facilities at various points along the system, which allow for additional volumes to be delivered into the pipeline.
during 2014, occidental sold its interest in bridgetex pipeline while retaining access to united states gulf markets through the pipeline. the bridgetex pipeline transports crude oil between the permian region and the united states gulf coast refinery markets and began service in the second half of 2014. simultaneously with the sale of occidental's interest in the bridgetex pipeline, occidental completed the sale of a portion of its investment in plains pipeline. following the fourth quarter 2014 sale of a portion of its investment, occidental owns approximately 13 percent of plains pipeline. the plains pipeline investment contributed approximately 19 percent of the segment's earnings for 2014, excluding the gain from the sale.
occidental's 2014 pipeline transportation earnings declined from 2013 due to lower income from its investment in plains pipeline as a result of occidental's lower ownership interest.
power generation facilities earnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties and the increase in earnings in 2014 compared to 2013 was due to higher margins from higher spark spreads and production.
industry outlook the pipeline transportation and power generation businesses are expected to remain relatively stable. the gas processing plant operations could have volatile results depending mostly on ngls prices, which cannot reasonably be predicted. generally, higher ngls prices result in higher profitability. although the marketing and trading business in isolation can be volatile in periods of severe price swings, occidental does not expect the volatility of these operations to be significant to the company as a whole given occidental's framework of controls and risk management. occidental continues to actively focus on marketing its commodity production to generate maximum value for its stakeholders.
segment results of operations segment earnings exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and income from the segments' equity investments. seasonality is not a primary driver of changes in occidental's consolidated quarterly earnings during the year.
the statements of income and cash flows, and supplemental oil and gas information related to california resources have been treated as discontinued operations for all periods presented. the assets and liabilities of california resources were removed from occidental's consolidated balance sheet as of november 30, 2014.
the following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items:
unallocated corporate items interest expense, net                                      (71     )              (124     )              (141     )
(a)   intersegment sales eliminate upon consolidation and are generally made at prices approximating those that the selling entity would be able to obtain in third-party transactions.
(b)   the 2014 amount includes a net $5.3 billion of pre-tax charges related to the impairments of domestic and international assets, other charges and the sale of hugoton assets. the 2013 amount includes $607 million of pre-tax charges related to the impairment of domestic non-producing acreage. the 2012 amount includes pre-tax charges of $1.7 billion for the impairment of domestic gas assets and related items.
(c)   the 2014 amount includes $149 million pre-tax charges related to impairments of chemical assets. the 2013 amount includes a $131 million pre-tax gain from the sale of an investment in carbocloro, a brazilian chemical facility.
(d)   the 2014 amount includes a $633 million pre-tax gain from the sale of occidental's interest in bridgetex pipeline company, llc, and a $1.4 billion pre-tax gain from the sale of an investment in plains pipeline. the 2013 amount includes a $1.0 billion pre-tax gain from the sale of a portion of an investment in plains pipeline and other items.
(f)   the 2014 amount includes an $805 million pre-tax charge related to the impairment of the joslyn oil sands project and a $553 million charge related to an other than temporary loss for retained shares of california resources. the 2013 amount includes a $55 million pre-tax charge for the estimated cost related to the employment and post-employment benefits for occidental's former executive chairman and termination of certain other employees and consulting arrangements.

united states                     $84.73              $92.48              $88.25
united states                     $37.79              $38.65              $44.06
united states                      $3.97               $3.22               $2.48
oil and gas segment earnings in 2014 included pre-tax charges of $5.3 billion related to the impairment of domestic and international assets and the gain from the sale of hugoton assets and earnings in 2013 included pre-tax charges of $0.6 billion for the impairment of domestic non-producing acreage. in 2012, oil and gas segment earnings included pre-tax charges of $1.7 billion for the impairment of domestic gas assets and related items.
domestic oil and gas segment earnings, excluding impairment and other charges in both years, were $1.9 billion in 2014 compared to $2.5 billion in 2013. the decrease in domestic earnings reflected lower crude oil and ngls prices, higher operating costs from increased workover and maintenance activities, and higher dd&a expenses, partially offset by higher crude oil production volumes and improved realized prices for gas. international oil and gas segment earnings, excluding impairments, were $4.0 billion in 2014 and $4.6 billion in 2013. international earnings reflected lower realized crude oil prices and sales volumes, partially offset by lower operating expenses and dd&a.
average production costs for 2014, excluding taxes other than on income, were $13.50 per boe, compared to $12.56 per boe for 2013. the increase in average costs reflects increased domestic activity in downhole maintenance and higher costs for purchased injectants.
average daily oil and gas production volumes, excluding hugoton production, were flat at 591,000 boe in 2014 and 2013. average domestic daily production increased by 10,000 boe to 312,000 boe in 2014. during this same time period, domestic daily oil production increased by over 6 percent or 11,000 barrels per day to 181,000 barrels, mainly coming from permian resources. international average daily production volumes decreased to 279,000 boe in 2014 from 289,000 boe in 2013. the decrease was primarily due to lower cost recovery barrels in iraq and insurgent activities in colombia, libya and yemen. total company average daily sales volumes, excluding hugoton, were 592,000 boe in 2014 and 590,000 boe in 2013.
average daily oil and gas production volumes, excluding hugoton, were 591,000 boe for 2013, compared to 599,000 boe for 2012. occidental's 2013 average daily domestic oil and ngls production increased by 8,000 boe or 5 percent and 1,000 boe, respectively, as compared to 2012 while gas production decreased by 30 mmcf or 6 percent as occidental focused its development program on oil production. international average daily production volumes decreased to 289,000 boe in 2013 compared to 301,000 boe in 2012, primarily from lower cost recovery barrels from dolphin and oman and higher levels of insurgent activities in libya. average daily sales volumes, excluding hugoton, were 590,000 boe in 2013, compared to 598,000 boe in 2012.
chemical segment earnings, excluding asset impairments of $149 million in 2014 and gain on sale of $131 million from the sale of the carbocloro investment, were $569 million in 2014 compared to $612 million in 2013. the lower earnings in 2014 were primarily a result of lower caustic soda pricing driven by new chlor-alkali capacity in the industry and higher energy and ethylene costs, partially offset by higher pvc margins and improved volumes across most product lines.
midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2014, excluding impairments and other items and gains on sales of $2.0 billion in 2014 and $1.0 billion in 2013, were $549 million in 2014, compared to $537 million in 2013. the increase in earnings reflected higher income from the gas processing and power generation businesses, partially offset by lower marketing performance and pipeline income.
midstream and marketing segment earnings in 2013 were $537 million, excluding the $1.0 billion pre-tax gain from the sale of a portion of an investment in plains pipeline and other items, compared to $396 million in 2012. the 2013 results reflected higher earnings in the pipeline and power generation businesses and improved marketing and trading performance. marketing performance improved by $110 million, mainly as a result of capturing regional crude price differentials by utilizing new pipelines providing access to the united states gulf coast refineries. these improvements were partially offset by lower income in the gas processing business due in part to the plant turnarounds in the permian basin operations.
significant items affecting earnings the following table sets forth, for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 significant transactions and events affecting occidental's earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount:
significant items affecting earnings benefit (charge) (in millions)                                              2014                2013                  2012
asset impairments and related items domestic                         (4,766    )           (607    )        (1,690      )

taxes deferred tax liabilities, net of deferred tax assets of $1.4 billion, were $2.9 billion at december 31, 2014. the current portion of the deferred tax assets of $110 million is included in other current assets. the deferred tax assets, net of allowances, are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences.
unallocated corporate items                          (1,871   )            (531   )            (512   )
occidental's 2014 worldwide tax rate was 109 percent, which was higher than 2013 mainly due to an other than temporary loss on occidental's available for sale investment in california resources stock and the oil and gas international asset impairments of $1.1 billion, neither of which had a tax benefit. to a lesser degree, foreign pre-tax income was proportionately higher in 2014, which is generally taxed at a higher rate than domestic pre-tax income. the 2013 worldwide tax rate was lower than 2012 due to proportionately higher domestic pre-tax income in 2013.
a deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to unremitted earnings of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries, as it is occidental's intention, generally, to reinvest such earnings permanently. if the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested, an additional deferred tax liability of approximately $140 million would be required, assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits.
revenue and other income items
gain on sale of assets and equity investments          $2,505              $1,175                  $-
expense items
asset impairments and related items                                       $7,379                $621              $1,710
cost of sales increased in 2014, compared to 2013, due to higher energy and feedstock costs in the chemical segment and increased domestic down hole maintenance activities and higher costs for purchased injectants in the oil and gas segment.
selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2013 due to higher compensation and employee-related costs, in particular higher equity compensation due to higher stock prices, as well as the charge related to the employment and post-employment benefits for occidental's former executive chairman and termination of certain other employees and consulting arrangements.
asset impairments and related items in 2014 of $7.4 billion included $2.8 billion in the williston basin, $904 million related to occidental's gas and ngls assets, $889 million for other domestic acreage and $1.1 billion primarily related to operations in bahrain and other international operations. asset impairments also include charges for joslyn oil sands of $805 million and an other than temporary loss of $553 million for the available for sale investment in california resources stock. see note 15 of the consolidated financial statements.
asset impairments and related items in 2013 of $621 million were mostly related to the impairment of certain non-producing domestic oil and gas acreage.
asset impairments and related items in 2012 were almost all in midcontinent, over 90 percent of which were related to natural gas properties that were acquired previously when gas prices were above $6 per mcf.
other items income/(expense) (in millions)   2014                2013                2012
income from equity investments            $331                $395                $363
income from equity investments decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, due to occidental's reduced ownership in the plains pipeline as portions of the investment were sold in fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013. the increase in equity income in 2013, compared to 2012, reflected higher earnings from occidental's equity investments in pipelines.
consolidated analysis of financial position the changes in select components of occidental's balance sheet are discussed below:
investments in unconsolidated entities                       $1,171              $1,459
current liabilities accounts payable                                             $5,229              $5,520
accrued liabilities                                           2,601               2,556
total current liabilities                                    $8,244              $8,434
deferred credits and other liabilities-income taxes          $3,015              $7,197
deferred credits and other liabilities-other                 $3,203              $3,501
stockholders' equity                                        $34,959             $43,372
assets see "liquidity and capital resources - cash flow analysis" for discussion of the change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash.
the decline in trade receivables, net, was due to lower oil and gas prices at the end of 2014, compared to the end of 2013. the decrease in inventories primarily resulted from lower storage inventories. the decrease in other current assets mainly reflected the spin-off of california resources. the decrease in investments in unconsolidated entities was due to the sale of a portion of occidental's interest in plains pipeline. the retained interest in california resources after the separation is recorded as an available for sale investment. the decrease in pp&e, net, was due to the spin-off of california resources, dd&a and asset impairments, partially offset by capital expenditures and acquisitions of oil and gas properties.
liabilities and stockholders' equity the decrease in accounts payable reflected the spin-off of california resources and lower marketing payables as a result of lower oil and gas prices at the end of 2014, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable associated with increased permian development activities.
the decrease in deferred credits and other liabilities-income taxes reflected the spin-off of california resources as a portion of the deferred tax liability was divested. the decrease in deferred credits and other liabilities-other was primarily due to the reduction of asset retirement obligations as a result of the spin-off of california resources. the decrease in stockholders' equity reflected the distribution of california resources stock as a one-time stock dividend, the distribution of cash dividends and share repurchases, partially offset by 2014 net income.
liquidity and capital resources at december 31, 2014, occidental had approximately $3.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $4 billion in restricted cash. a substantial majority of this cash is held and available for use in the united states, and occidental believes the cash in foreign jurisdictions can be brought to the united states without paying significant taxes. income and cash flows are largely dependent on the oil and gas segment's prices, sales volumes and costs. occidental believes that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs and planned capital expenditures, dividends and any debt payments.
as a result of the tax-free status of the spin-off of california resources, occidental's use of restricted cash is limited to the payment of dividends, repayment of debt or share repurchases. to retain the tax-free status of the spin-off, the restricted cash must be used for one of these purposes within eighteen months from the date of distribution.
in august 2014, occidental entered into a new five-year, $2.0 billion bank credit facility (2014 credit facility) which replaced its previous $2.0 billion bank credit facility (2011 credit facility), which was scheduled to expire in october 2016. the 2014 credit facility has similar terms to the 2011 credit facility and does not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict occidental's ability to borrow under this facility. occidental did not draw down any amounts under the 2014 credit facility or the 2011 credit facility during 2014 and no amounts were outstanding as of december 31, 2014.
as of december 31, 2014, under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements, occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings, the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, or acquisitions of, occidental stock.
occidental, from time to time, may access and has accessed debt markets for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. at this time, occidental does not anticipate any need for such funding.
cash flow analysis cash provided by operating activities
net cash provided by operating activities                                               $11,068             $12,778             $11,299
cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased $1.3 billion in 2014 to $8.9 billion, compared to $10.2 billion in 2013. operating cash flows were negatively impacted by lower oil prices in the second half of 2014, which on a year-over-year basis declined 8-percent domestically and 9-percent worldwide, and higher domestic operating expenses for increased workover activity and higher prices for purchased injectants. also in 2014, occidental paid higher income taxes, in part related to the fourth quarter 2013 sale of a portion of the investment in plains pipeline and the first half of 2014 sale of hugoton assets, while 2013 included the collection of a tax receivable. working capital changes in receivables reflected higher collections in the first half of 2014.
cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2013 increased $1.1 billion to $10.2 billion, from $9.1 billion in 2012. the increase in operating cash flows was mainly from domestic operations driven by lower operating costs, which reflected our cost savings initiatives, higher realized prices for oil and gas of nearly 5 percent and 30 percent, respectively, and higher oil production volumes. also, cash flows from our foreign operations were negatively impacted by lower sales volumes in the middle east/north africa. in addition, cash flows were impacted favorably due to the collection of a federal tax receivable which was booked in 2012 and other working capital changes.
other cost elements, such as labor costs and overhead, are not significant drivers of changes in cash flow because they are relatively stable within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term. changes in these costs had a much smaller effect on cash flows than changes in oil and gas product prices, sales volumes and operating costs.
occidental booked significant non-cash adjustments to income as a result of lower product prices and management's strategic review. asset impairments and related items were $7.4 billion, $0.6 billion and $1.7 billion for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the 2014 impairments are the result of a thorough portfolio review which resulted in the reduction of carrying values for projects which have sub-par returns in the current price environment. the 2013 impairment was mostly related to non-producing domestic oil and gas acreage and the 2012
occidental recorded gains from the sales of assets and equity investments of $2.5 billion in 2014 and $1.2 billion in 2013. cash proceeds related to these gains are reported as investing activities.

compared to $7.2 billion in 2013, occidental's net capital expenditures for 2014 were $8.7 billion after netting of partner contributions for the bridgetex pipeline, which is included in financing activities, and the chemical joint venture. the increase in capital expenditures of $1.5 billion from 2013 to 2014 was due to increased development activity in the domestic oil and gas operations, primarily permian resources. the increase in the midstream and marketing capital expenditures was due to higher spending for the al hosn gas project and bridgetex pipeline.
occidental's 2015 net capital spending is expected to be $5.8 billion, mainly allocated to permian resources and certain middle east projects. occidental has minimized development activities in the williston basin, domestic gas properties and bahrain, as these have sub-par returns in the current product price environment. oil and gas capital spending is expected to be approximately $4.5 billion in 2015.
compared to $7.8 billion in 2012, occidental's net capital expenditures for 2013 were $7.2 billion, net of partner contributions. the decrease in capital expenditures from 2012 to 2013 was mainly due to the $0.6 billion decrease in oil and gas expenditures, a majority of which was in domestic properties. this reduction reflected cost savings from occidental's efficiency initiatives. the increase for the chemical segment was due to the continued construction of the tennessee chlor-alkali facility. the decrease in the midstream and marketing capital expenditures was due to lower spending for the al hosn gas project, partially offset by increased spending for bridgetex pipeline.
cash flows from other investing activities, net, increased to $2.7 billion in 2014 from $1.0 billion in 2013. the 2014 other investing activities, net, included proceeds of $1.3 billion for the sale of the hugoton field operations, $1.1 billion for the sale of the bridgetex pipeline and $1.7 billion for the sale of a portion of occidental's investment in plains pipeline, which was partially offset by $1.7 billion of acquisitions, mainly in the permian basin. the 2013 other
investing activities, net included proceeds of $1.4 billion for the sale of a portion of the investment in plains pipeline and $0.3 billion for the sale of chemical's investment in carbocloro, which was partially offset by acquisitions of approximately $0.6 billion.
the 2012 other investing activities, net included $2.0 billion in payments for the acquisition of businesses and assets.
commitments at december 31, 2014 for major fixed and determinable capital expenditures were approximately $1.4 billion, which will be due in 2015 and beyond.  occidental expects to fund its commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations.
cash used by financing activities
net cash used by financing activities                                 $(2,202     )       $(2,933     )       $(846     )
cash used for financing activities in 2014 included special cash distributions received prior to the separation of california resources of $6.1 billion, of which $4.95 billion was restricted cash. approximately $0.9 billion of the restricted cash was used for share repurchases and the fourth quarter dividend payment, resulting in a $4.0 billion restricted cash balance as of december 31, 2014. the 2014 net cash used by financing activities included $2.5 billion for purchases of treasury stock and $2.2 billion for dividend payments, which were partially offset by $0.4 billion for contributions received from a noncontrolling interest. a dividend payment was accelerated in 2012 which resulted in three dividend payments in 2013, whereas there were four cash dividend payments in 2014.
the 2013 net cash used by financing activities included $0.7 billion used to retire debt and $0.2 billion of contributions received from a noncontrolling interest. common stock dividends paid decreased by $0.6 billion to $1.6 billion in 2013, due to the accelerated payment in 2012 of that year's fourth quarter dividend. in addition, purchases of treasury stock increased from $0.6 billion in 2012 to over $0.9 billion in 2013. higher 2013 net cash use compared to 2012 also reflected the net proceeds in 2012 of approximately $1.7 billion from the issuance of senior unsecured notes that year.
guarantees occidental has guaranteed its portion of equity method investees' debt and has entered into various other guarantees including performance bonds, letters of credit, indemnities and commitments provided by occidental to third parties, mainly to provide assurance that opc or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations (guarantees). as of december 31, 2014, occidental's guarantees were not material and a substantial majority consisted of limited recourse guarantees on approximately $336 million of dolphin's debt. the fair value of the guarantees was immaterial.
occidental has guaranteed certain obligations of its subsidiaries for various letters of credit, indemnities and commitments. marketing guarantees provided to third parties for california resources total approximately $161 million as of december 31, 2014. the fair value of the marketing guarantees and other obligations of california resources guaranteed by occidental were immaterial.
leases occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements, mainly for transportation equipment, power plants, machinery, terminals, storage facilities, land and office space. occidental leases assets when leasing offers greater operating flexibility. lease payments are generally expensed as part of cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. for more information, see "contractual obligations."
other long-term liabilities (b)                1,808                 125                      391                      282                          1,010
(b)   includes obligations under postretirement benefit and deferred compensation plans, as well as certain accrued liabilities.
(c)   amounts include payments which will become due under long-term agreements to purchase goods and services used in the normal course of business to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling rigs and services, co2, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials. amounts exclude certain product purchase obligations related to marketing and trading activities for which there are no minimum purchase requirements or the amounts are not fixed or determinable. long-term purchase contracts are discounted at a 3.14 percent discount rate.
delivery commitments occidental has made commitments to certain refineries and other buyers to deliver oil, gas and ngls. the total amount contracted to be delivered, a substantial majority of which is in the united states, is approximately 430 million barrels of oil through 2025, 37 billion cubic feet of gas through 2016 and 24 million barrels of ngls through 2016. the price for these deliveries is set at the time of delivery of the product. occidental has significantly more production capacity than the amounts committed and has the ability to secure additional volumes in case of a shortfall. none of the commitments in any given year is expected to have a material impact on occidental's financial statements.
lawsuits, claims and contingencies opc or certain of its subsidiaries are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses, punitive damages, civil penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief. opc or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act (cercla) and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws. these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief. usually opc or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies. further, some lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction.
occidental has entered into a written settlement agreement with the state of new jersey (the state) to resolve claims asserted by the state against occidental arising from occidental's acquisition of diamond shamrock chemicals company (dscc) and historic operations of dscc's lister avenue plant. in december 2014, the settlement was approved by the court. under the settlement agreement (state settlement) occidental will pay the state $190 million and, under certain circumstances, perform or fund future work on behalf of the state along a portion of the passaic river. when occidental acquired the stock of dscc in 1986, maxus energy corporation, a subsidiary of ypf s.a. (maxus), retained liability for the lister avenue plant, which is part of the diamond alkali superfund site, as well as other sites. maxus is also obligated to indemnify occidental for the state settlement. occidental is pursuing maxus to recover the settlement costs. the state settlement does not cover any potential occidental share of costs associated with the epa's proposed clean-up plan of the passaic river announced in april 2014. maxus is also responsible for federal clean-up or other costs associated with the lister avenue plant and the diamond alkali superfund site.
occidental accrues reserves for currently outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated. occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental matters. reserve balances for other matters as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 were not material to occidental's consolidated balance sheets. occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible losses that it could incur as a result of the matters mentioned above. occidental has disclosed its range of reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental remediation. occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations. environmental matters are further discussed under the caption "environmental liabilities and expenditures" below.
during the course of its operations, occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions. although taxable years through 2009 for united states federal income tax purposes have been audited by the united states internal revenue service (irs) pursuant to its compliance assurance program, subsequent taxable years are currently under review. additionally, in december 2012, occidental filed united states federal refund claims for tax years 2008 and 2009 which are subject to irs review. taxable years from 2000 through the current year remain subject to examination by foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions. in certain of these jurisdictions, tax authorities are in various stages of auditing occidental's income taxes. during the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law. occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
opc, its subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with occidental. these indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. as of december 31, 2014, occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.
environmental liabilities and expenditures occidental's operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality. occidental's environmental compliance costs have generally increased over time and are expected to rise in the future. occidental factors environmental expenditures for its operations into its business planning process as an integral part of producing quality products responsive to market demand.
environmental remediation the laws that require or address environmental remediation, including cercla and similar federal, state, local and foreign laws, may apply retroactively and, regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites. opc or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites. remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems. the environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs.
as of december 31, 2014, occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 145 sites, excluding seven sites transferred to california resources prior to december 31, 2014. the following table presents occidental's environmental remediation reserves as of december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the u.s. environmental protection agency on the cercla national priorities list (npl sites) and three categories of non-npl sites - third-party sites, occidental-operated sites and closed or non-operated occidental sites.

as of december 31, 2014, occidental's environmental reserves exceeded $10 million each at 11 of the 145 sites described above, and 98 of the sites had reserves from $0 to $1 million each.
as of december 31, 2014, two sites - a landfill in western new york owned by occidental and a former refinery in louisiana - accounted for 62 percent of its reserves associated with npl sites. in connection with a 1986 acquisition, maxus energy corporation has retained the liability and is indemnifying occidental for 14 of the remaining npl sites.
as of december 31, 2014, maxus has also retained the liability and is indemnifying occidental for 8 of the 67 third-party sites. four of the remaining 59 third-party sites - a former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee, a containment and removal project in tennessee, a former chemical plant in ohio and an active refinery in louisiana where occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities - accounted for 56 percent of occidental's reserves associated with these sites.
four sites - chemical plants in kansas, louisiana and new york and a group of oil and gas properties in the southwestern united states - accounted for 62 percent of the reserves associated with the occidental-operated sites.
four other sites - a landfill in western new york, former chemical plants in tennessee and delaware and a closed coal mine in pennsylvania - accounted for 63 percent of the reserves associated with closed or non-operated occidental sites.
environmental reserves vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions, identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation. the following table presents environmental reserve activity for the past three years:
based on current estimates, occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately half of the current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next three to four years and the balance at these sites over the subsequent 10 or more years. occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental remediation at these sites could be up to $380 million. see "critical accounting policies and estimates - environmental liabilities and expenditures" for additional information.
capital expenditures oil and gas                      $143               $67               $79
operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis. capital expenditures relate to longer-lived improvements in properties currently operated by occidental. remediation expenses relate to existing conditions from past operations.
occidental presently estimates capital expenditures for environmental compliance of approximately $160 million for 2015.
critical accounting policies and estimates the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires occidental's management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions. changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments, and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts. there has been no material change to occidental's critical accounting policies over the past three years. the selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors. occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve management's judgment.
oil and gas properties the carrying value of occidental's pp&e represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any asset retirement obligations and capitalized interest, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization (dd&a) and any impairment charges. for assets acquired, pp&e cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date. asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets.
occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties. under this method, occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs. the costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found. if proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized. otherwise, occidental charges the costs of the related wells to expense. in some cases, a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells. occidental generally expenses the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a 12-month period after drilling is complete.
occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unit-of-production method. it amortizes acquisition costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves.
proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible-from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations-prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures.
several factors could change occidental's proved oil and gas reserves. for example, occidental receives a share of production from pscs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit. occidental's share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline. overall, occidental's net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices. in other cases, particularly with long-lived properties, lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical. for such properties, higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical. estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidental's control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs. these factors, in turn, could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves. additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded. in 2014, revisions of previous estimates caused a net 58 million boe decrease in proved reserves, which amounted to approximately 2 percent of occidental's total reserves as of december 31, 2014.
additionally, occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable. if there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to declines in current and forward prices, significant changes in reserve estimates, changes in management's plans, or other significant events, management will evaluate the property for impairment. under the successful efforts method, if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property, the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment
charge in the period. individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows, which is generally on a field by field basis. the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants. the impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time. these assumptions include estimates of future product prices, contractual prices, estimates of risk-adjusted proved oil and gas reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs.
the most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in occidental's oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the dd&a rate. for example, a 5-percent increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the dd&a rate by approximately $0.70 per barrel, which would increase or decrease pre-tax income by approximately $155 million annually at current production rates. the change in the dd&a rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has been immaterial.
a portion of the carrying value of occidental's oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties. at december 31, 2014, the net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $2.0 billion. the unproved amounts are not subject to dd&a until they are classified as proved properties. capitalized costs attributable to the properties become subject to dd&a when proved reserves are assigned to the property. if the exploration efforts are unsuccessful, or management decides not to pursue development of these properties as a result of lower commodity prices, higher development and operating costs, contractual conditions or other factors, the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed. the timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties, if warranted, depends upon management's plans, the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results. occidental believes its current plans and exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize its unproved property balance.
during its annual capital planning process in the fourth quarter of 2014, management determined that it would not pursue development of certain of its non-producing domestic oil and gas acreage based on product prices, availability of transportation capacity to market the products and regulatory and environmental considerations. as a result, occidental recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $1.4 billion for the acreage. in addition, during the second quarter of 2014, occidental recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $471 million for domestic non-producing acreage.
chemical assets occidental's chemical assets are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or the straight-line method, based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities. the estimated useful lives of occidental's chemical assets, which range from three years to 50 years, are also used for impairment tests. the estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained. such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance, as well as planned major maintenance activities (pmma). ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred. pmma costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul. additionally, occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets, increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use. these capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service. the resulting revision, if any, of the asset's estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively.
without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly. other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of occidental's chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, demand, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations and technological changes.
occidental performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management's plans change with respect to those assets. any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
occidental's net pp&e for the chemical segment is approximately $2.6 billion and its depreciation expense for 2015 is expected to be approximately $310 million. the most significant financial statement impact of a decrease in the estimated useful lives of occidental's chemical plants would be on depreciation expense. for example, a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pre-tax earnings by approximately $50 million per year.
midstream, marketing and other assets derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty. occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cash-flow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment. otherwise, any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period. for cash-flow hedges, the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (oci) with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged. realized gains or losses from cash-flow hedges, and any ineffective portion, are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of income. ineffectiveness is primarily created by a lack of correlation between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location, quality, grade or changes in the expected quantity of the
hedged item. gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of income. there were no fair value hedges as of and during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
a hedge is regarded as highly effective such that it qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception and throughout its life, it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be offset by 80 to 125 percent of the changes in the fair value or cash flows, respectively, of the hedging instrument. in the case of hedging a forecast transaction, the transaction must be probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss. occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge; when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; or when a forecast transaction is no longer deemed probable.
occidental's midstream and marketing pp&e is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method. occidental performs impairment tests on its midstream and marketing assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management's plans change with respect to those assets. any impairment loss would be calculated as the excess of the asset's net book value over its estimated fair value.
fair value measurements occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: level 1 - using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities; level 2 - using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities; and level 3 - using unobservable inputs.  transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the end of each reporting period.
fair values - recurring occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs. occidental utilizes the mid-point between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value. in addition to using market data, occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. for assets and liabilities carried at fair value, occidental measures fair value using the following methods:
ø   occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date. these derivatives are classified as level 1. over-the-counter (otc) bilateral financial commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as level 2 and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
ø   occidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves. the assumptions used include inputs that are generally unobservable in the marketplace or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions and the fair value is designated as level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.
occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when there is not a market-observable price for an identical or similar asset or liability.  this approach utilizes management's judgments regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts those cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate.
environmental liabilities and expenditures environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. occidental records environmental reserves and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. in determining the reserves and the range of reasonably possible additional losses, occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements. occidental bases environmental reserves on management's estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective. occidental periodically reviews reserves and adjusts them as new information becomes available. occidental records environmental reserves on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established. the reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established. the amount of discounted environmental reserves is insignificant. occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable. as of december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, occidental did not have any accruals for reimbursements or recoveries.
many factors could affect occidental's future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental reserves and range of reasonably possible additional losses. the most significant are: (1) cost
estimates for remedial activities may be inaccurate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify occidental's proposed remedial plan; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; (5) laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability; and (6) changes in allocation or cost-sharing arrangements may occur.
certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs. in these circumstances, occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to participate when estimating occidental's ultimate share of liability. occidental records reserves at its expected net cost of remedial activities and, based on these factors, believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.
in addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at npl sites, occidental's reserves include management's estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems. if remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, occidental reviews and adjusts its reserves accordingly.
if occidental were to adjust the environmental reserve balance based on the factors described above, the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings. for example, if the reserve balance were reduced by 10 percent, occidental would record a pre-tax gain of $33 million. if the reserve balance were increased by 10 percent, occidental would record an additional remediation expense of $33 million.
other loss contingencies occidental is involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings and audits. occidental accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated. in addition, occidental discloses, in aggregate, its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred. occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis.
loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate. management's judgments could change based on new information, changes in, or interpretations of, laws or regulations, changes in management's plans or intentions, opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings, or other factors. see "lawsuits, claims and contingencies" for additional information.
in january 2015, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued rules which eliminate from gaap the concept of extraordinary item. the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring. the rules are not expected to have an impact on occidental's financial statements upon adoption.
in june 2014, the fasb issued rules affecting entities that grant their employees share-based payment awards in which the terms of the awards provide that a performance target can be achieved after the requisite service period. the new rules require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. entities may apply the update either: (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. these rules are effective for annual periods beginning on or after december 15, 2015. the rules are not expected to have a material impact on occidental's financial statements upon adoption but will require assessment on an ongoing basis.
in may 2014, the fasb issued rules relating to revenue recognition. under the new rules, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services. the rules also require more detailed disclosures related to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. these rules are effective for the company for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016. the rules are not expected to have a material impact on occidental's financial statements upon adoption.

overview we are a leading global investment firm that manages investments across multiple asset classes including private equity, energy, infrastructure, real estate, credit and hedge funds. we aim to generate attractive investment returns by following a patient and disciplined investment approach, employing world-class people, and driving growth and value creation in the assets we manage. we invest our own capital alongside the capital we manage for fund investors and bring debt and equity investment opportunities to others through our capital markets business.
our business offers a broad range of investment management services to our fund investors and provides capital markets services to our firm, our portfolio companies and third parties. throughout our history, we have consistently been a leader in the private equity industry, having completed more than 250 private equity investments in portfolio companies with a total transaction value in excess of $505 billion. we have grown our firm by expanding our geographical presence and building businesses in new areas, such as credit, special situations, hedge funds, collateralized loan obligations ("clos"), capital markets, infrastructure, energy and real estate. these efforts build on our core principles and industry expertise, allowing us to leverage the intellectual capital and synergies in our businesses, and to capitalize on a broader range of the opportunities we source. additionally, we have increased our focus on meeting the needs of our existing fund investors and in developing relationships with new investors in our funds.
we conduct our business with offices throughout the world, providing us with a pre-eminent global platform for sourcing transactions, raising capital and carrying out capital markets activities. our growth has been driven by value that we have created through our operationally focused investment approach, the expansion of our existing businesses, our entry into new lines of business, innovation in the products that we offer investors in our funds, an increased focus on providing tailored solutions to our clients and the integration of capital markets distribution activities.
we have also used our balance sheet as a significant source of capital to further grow and expand our business, increase our participation in our existing businesses and further align our interests with those of our fund investors and other stakeholders. the majority of our balance sheet consists of general partner interests in kkr investment funds, limited partner interests in certain kkr investment funds, co-investments in certain portfolio companies of kkr private equity funds and interests in clos, corporate loans, debt securities and energy and real estate assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of kkr financial holdings on april 30, 2014. our balance sheet also holds other assets used in the development of our business, including seed capital for new strategies.
as a global investment firm, we earn management, monitoring, transaction and incentive fees for providing investment management, monitoring and other services to our funds, vehicles, clos, managed accounts and portfolio companies, and we generate transaction-specific income from capital markets transactions. we earn additional investment income from investing our own capital alongside that of our fund investors and from other balance sheet investments and from the carried interest we receive from our funds and certain of our other investment vehicles. a carried interest entitles the
sponsor of a fund to a specified percentage of investment gains that are generated on third-party capital that is invested.
our investment teams have deep industry knowledge and are supported by a substantial and diversified capital base, an integrated global investment platform, the expertise of operating consultants and senior advisors and a worldwide network of business relationships that provide a significant source of investment opportunities, specialized knowledge during due diligence and substantial resources for creating and realizing value for stakeholders. these teams invest capital, a substantial portion of which is of a long duration and not subject to redemption. with over 75% of our fee paying assets under management not subject to redemption for at least 8 years from inception, we have significant flexibility to grow investments and select exit opportunities. we believe that these aspects of our business will help us continue to expand and grow our business and deliver strong investment performance in a variety of economic and financial conditions.
business segments private markets through our private markets segment, we manage and sponsor a group of private equity funds and co-investment vehicles that invest capital for long-term appreciation, either through controlling ownership of a company or strategic minority positions. we also manage and sponsor a group of funds and co-investment vehicles that invest capital in real assets, such as infrastructure, energy and real estate. these funds, vehicles and accounts are managed by kohlberg kravis roberts & co. l.p., an sec registered investment adviser. as of december 31, 2014, the segment had $61.5 billion of aum and fpaum of $47.3 billion, consisting of $38.3 billion in private equity and $9.0 billion in real assets (including infrastructure, energy and real estate) and other strategies. prior to 2010, fpaum in the private markets segment consisted entirely of private equity funds.
public markets we operate and report our combined credit and hedge funds businesses through the public markets segment. our credit business advises funds, clos, separately managed accounts, and investment companies registered under the investment company act, including a business development company or bdc, undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities or ucits, and alternative investments funds or aifs, which invest capital in (i) leveraged credit strategies, such as leveraged loans, high yield bonds and opportunistic credit, and (ii) alternative credit strategies such as mezzanine investments, direct lending investments, special situations investments and long/short credit investment strategies. the funds, accounts, registered investment companies and clos in our leveraged credit and alternative credit strategies are managed by kkr credit advisors (us) llc (formerly known as kkr asset management llc), which is a sec-registered investment adviser, kkr credit advisors (ireland), regulated by the central bank of ireland, and kkr credit advisors (uk), regulated by the united kingdom financial conduct authority, or fca. kkr credit advisors (ireland) and kkr credit advisors (uk) (formerly known collectively as avoca capital) were acquired by kkr on february 19, 2014. our public markets segment also includes our hedge funds business that offers a variety of investment strategies including customized hedge fund portfolios, hedge fund-of-fund solutions and acquiring stakes in or seeding hedge fund managers. the funds and accounts in our hedge fund business are managed by prisma capital partners lp, an sec-registered investment adviser.
in our hedge funds stakes and seeding business, we have a 24.9% interest in nephila capital ltd., or nephila, an investment manager focused on investing in natural catastrophe and weather risk, and a 24.9% interest in blackgold capital management l.p., or blackgold, a credit-oriented investment manager focused on investing in energy and hard asset investments.
we intend to continue to grow the public markets business by leveraging our global investment platform, experienced investment professionals and the ability to adapt our investment strategies to different market conditions to capitalize on investment opportunities that may arise at various levels of the capital structure and across market cycles.
as of december 31, 2014, this segment had $37.1 billion of aum, comprised of $17.5 billion of assets managed in our leveraged credit strategies, $8.7 billion of assets managed in our alternative credit strategies $10.2 billion of assets managed in our hedge fund solutions strategies and $0.7 billion of assets managed in other strategies. our alternative credit investments include $1.8 billion of assets managed in our mezzanine strategy, $2.4 billion of assets managed in our direct lending strategy, $3.5 billion of assets managed in our special situations strategies and $1.0 billion of assets managed in our long/short credit strategy. the following chart presents the growth in the aum of our public markets segment from the commencement of its operations in august 2004 through december 31, 2014.
capital markets and other our capital markets and other segment is comprised primarily of our global capital markets business. our capital markets business supports our firm, our private equity portfolio companies and third-party clients by developing and implementing both traditional and non-traditional capital solutions for investments or companies seeking financing. these services include arranging debt and equity financing for transactions, placing and underwriting securities offerings and providing other types of capital markets services. when we underwrite an offering of securities or a loan on a firm commitment basis, we commit to buy and sell an issue of securities or indebtedness and generate revenue by purchasing the securities or indebtedness at a discount or for a fee. when we act in an agency capacity, we generate revenue for arranging financing or placing securities or debt with capital markets investors. kkr capital markets llc is an sec-registered broker-dealer and a finra member, and we are also registered or authorized to carry out certain broker-dealer activities in various countries in north america, europe, asia-pacific and the middle east. our third party capital markets activities are generally carried out through merchant capital solutions llc, a joint venture with two other unaffiliated partners, and non-bank financial companies, or nbfcs, in india.
business environment market conditions as a global investment firm, we are affected by financial and economic conditions in north and south america, europe, asia-pacific and elsewhere in the world. global and regional economic conditions have a substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations, impacting both the success of the investments we make as well as our ability to exit these investments profitably and to make new investments. in terms of economic conditions, according to the bureau of economic analysis, real gdp in the u.s. increased 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2.4% for the full year ended december 31, 2014. as of january 2015, the international monetary fund, or imf, estimates that the u.s. economy will expand by 3.6% in 2015. according to the bureau of labor statistics, the u.s. unemployment rate decreased to 6.2% as of december 31, 2014. in the euro area, real gdp increased 0.34% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased 0.9% for full year ended december 31, 2014 according to eurostat. the euro area unemployment rate remains elevated at 11.6% as of october 7, 2014, despite recent signs of improvement according to the imf. as of january 2015, the imf estimates that the euro area will expand by 1.2% in 2015. according to the china bureau of national statistics, real gdp in china increased 1.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 7.4% for the full year ended december 31, 2014. as of january 2015, the imf estimates that china's economy will expand by 6.8% in 2015. in china, the unemployment rate remains relatively low at 4.1% as of december 31, 2014 according to the china bureau of national statistics.
in addition to economic conditions, global equity and debt markets also have a substantial effect on our financial condition and results of operations. global equity markets finished positively for the year ended december 31, 2014, with the s&p 500 index up 13.7% and the msci world index up 5.5%. equity market volatility rose during the quarter as evidenced by the chicago board options exchange market volatility index, or the vix, a measure of volatility, which began the quarter at 16.3 and ended at 19.2 on december 31, 2014, for an increase of 17.7%. the investment grade credit markets remained relatively flat, with the s&p/lsta leveraged loan index up 1.6% and the boaml hy master ii index up 2.5% during the year ended december 31, 2014, respectively. within credit markets, spreads have widened while issuances reached record levels in 2014. higher interest rates in conjunction with slower growth or weaker currencies in some emerging market economies may cause the default risk of these countries to increase, and this could impact the operations or value of our investments.
in addition, foreign exchange rates can materially impact the valuations of our investments that are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. for example, the euro fell 12% in 2014, while the british pound fell 6% last year relative to the u.s. dollar. currency fluctuations can also affect our businesses which deal in cross-border trade. u.s. dollar appreciation relative to other currencies is likely to cause a decrease in the u.s. dollar value of our non-u.s. investments to the extent unhedged, cause portfolio companies that export to the u.s. to suffer a decline in revenues, and make the exports of u.s. based companies less competitive. the recent unpegging of the euro-swiss franc exchange rate also highlights potential risks of currency volatility.
interest rates can also materially impact the valuation of our investments, particularly those valued in whole or in part using a discounted cash flow analysis. in 2014, many global central banks cut interest rates as historic low rates combined with the fall in oil prices and below-potential growth heightened deflationary fears, particularly in china, europe and japan. according to bloomberg, as at december 31, 2014, 10 year government bond yields for full year 2014 had declined by 97 basis points in china, 139 basis points in germany, 41 basis points in japan and 86 basis points in the u.s. in the u.s., the federal reserve ended its tapering campaign and has signaled a future rate increase.
our private markets portfolio contains several energy real asset investments whose values are influenced by the price of natural gas and oil. such energy real asset investments had a fair value of $0.7 billion, as of december 31, 2014. during the quarter ended december 31, 2014, the value of our energy real asset investments in working interests in oil and gas producing properties decreased meaningfully. this decrease in value was primarily attributable to a drop in long-term oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices during the year ended december 31, 2014 with the greatest declines occurring in the fourth quarter. for example, the 2017 price of wti crude oil declined from approximately $85 per barrel to $67 per barrel and the 2017 price of natural gas declined from approximately $4.22 per mcf to $3.76 per mcf as of september 30, 2014 and december 31, 2014, respectively. for additional information regarding our energy real asset valuation methodologies, see "critical accounting policiesfair value measurementslevel iii valuation methodologiesreal asset investments."
for a discussion of how financial and economic conditions impact our financial condition and results of operations see "risk factorsrisks related to our businessdifficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition," "risks related to the assets we managevaluation methodologies for certain assets in our funds and on our balance sheet can be subjective and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may never be realized, which could result in significant losses for our funds and us," "our investments are impacted by various economic conditions that are difficult to quantify or predict, but may have a significant adverse impact on the valuation of our investments,"
"dependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds and our principal assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments" and "we make investments in companies that are based outside of the united states, which may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in companies that are based in the united states" and see "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk".
business conditions our segment revenues consist of fees, performance income and investment income. our ability to grow our revenues depends in part on our ability to attract new capital and investors, our successful deployment of capital including from our balance sheet and our ability to realize investments.
 our ability to attract new capital and investors.  our ability to attract new capital and investors in our funds is driven, in part, by the extent to which they continue to see the alternative asset management industry generally, and our investment products specifically, as an attractive vehicle for capital appreciation or income. since 2010, we have expanded into strategies such as energy, infrastructure, real estate, alternative credit and hedge funds. in several of these strategies, our first time funds have begun raising successor funds, and we expect the cost of raising such successor funds to be lower. we have also reached out to a new investor base of retail and high net worth clients. however, fundraising continues to be competitive and as two of our three flagship private equity funds have completed fundraising and our fourth flagship fund focused on europe held its first close in 2014, the growth in aum and fpaum in the coming year may be lower. new capital raised for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 was $10.6 billion, $21.2 billion and $13.3 billion.
 our successful deployment of capital including from our balance sheet.  our ability to maintain and grow our revenue base is dependent upon our ability to successfully deploy the capital from our funds and our balance sheet. greater competition, high valuations, increased overall cost of credit and other general market conditions may impact our ability to identify and execute attractive investments.
additionally, because we seek to make investments which have an ability to achieve our targeted returns while taking on a reasonable level of risk, we may experience periods of reduced investment activity. we have a long-term investment horizon and the capital deployed in any one quarter may vary significantly from the capital deployed in any other quarter or the quarterly average of capital deployed in any given year. reduced levels of transaction activity also tends to result in a reduced potential future investment gains, lower transaction fees and lower fees for our capital markets business, which may earn fees in the syndication of equity or debt. equity invested for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 were $3.8 billion, $7.4 billion and
$10.2 billion, and syndicated capital for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 were $0.5 billion, $1.1 billion and $2.6 billion, such that 2014
reflects unusually high levels of activity for us on a historical basis.
 our ability to realize investments.  the strength and liquidity of the u.s. and relevant global equity markets generally, and the initial public offering market specifically affects the value of, and our ability to successfully exit, our equity positions in our private equity portfolio companies in a timely manner. we may also realize investments through strategic sales. for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, through exit activity in our investments, we realized carried interest of $0.5 billion, $0.7 billion and $1.2 billion. since december 31, 2014, we have closed the strategic sales of fotolia (media sector) and have received proceeds from the sale of walgreens boots alliance, inc. that was completed on december 31, 2014. pending transactions, the consummation of which are subject to closing conditions, include, as of february 20, 2015: big heart pet brands (consumer products sector) and biomet, inc. (healthcare sector). such sales, however, are episodic and reduced levels of sale activity in future quarters would reduce transaction fees, realized carry and distributions.
basis of accounting we consolidate the financial results of the kkr group partnerships and their consolidated subsidiaries, which include the accounts of our investment management and capital markets companies, the general partners of certain unconsolidated funds and vehicles, general partners of consolidated funds and their respective consolidated funds and certain other entities including certain consolidated clos.
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, or gaap, certain entities, including a substantial number of our funds and clos, are consolidated notwithstanding the fact that we may hold only a minority economic interest in those entities. in particular, in the majority of our consolidated funds and other investment vehicles, we hold a general partner interest that gives us substantive controlling rights over such funds and vehicles. with respect to our consolidated funds and vehicles, we generally have operational discretion and control, and fund investors have no substantive rights to impact ongoing governance and operating activities of the fund, including the ability to remove the general partner, also known as kick-out rights. as of december 31, 2014, our aum in our private markets segment included 20 consolidated investment vehicles and 13 unconsolidated investment vehicles. our aum in our public markets segment included 21 consolidated investment vehicles, including clos, and 68 unconsolidated investment vehicles.
when an entity is consolidated, we reflect the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses, investment income and cash flows of the consolidated entity on a gross basis. while the consolidation of a consolidated fund or entity does not have an effect on the amounts of net income attributable to kkr or kkr's partners' capital that kkr reports, the consolidation does significantly impact the financial statement presentation. this is due to the fact that the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses and investment income of the consolidated funds and entities are reflected on a gross basis while the allocable share of those amounts that are attributable to third parties are reflected as single line items. the single line items in which the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses and investment income attributable to third parties are recorded are presented as noncontrolling interests or appropriated capital on the consolidated statements of financial condition and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations. for a further discussion of our consolidation policies, see "critical accounting policiesconsolidation."
key financial measures under gaap fees and other fees and other consist primarily of (i) transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital markets activities, (ii) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, clos, other vehicles and separately managed accounts, (iii) monitoring fees from providing services to portfolio companies, (iv) revenue earned by oil and gas-producing entities that are consolidated and (v) consulting fees earned by entities that employ non-employee operating consultants. these fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned, which coincides with the period during which the related services are performed and in the case of transaction fees, upon closing of the transaction. monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control. these termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes.
fees and other reported in our consolidated financial statements do not include the management or incentive fees that we earn from consolidated funds and other entities, because those fees are eliminated in consolidation. however, because those management and incentive fees are earned from, and funded by, third-party investors who hold noncontrolling interests in the consolidated funds and entities, net income attributable to kkr is increased by the amount of the management fees that are eliminated in consolidation. accordingly, while the consolidation of funds and other entities impacts the amount of fees that are recognized in our financial statements, it does not affect the ultimate amount of net income attributable to kkr or kkr's partners' capital.
for a further discussion of our fee policies, see "critical accounting policiesrevenue recognition."
expenses compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense includes cash compensation consisting of salaries, bonuses, and benefits, as well as equity-based compensation consisting of charges associated with the vesting of equity-based awards and carry pool allocations. all employees of certain consolidated entities receive a base salary that is paid by kkr or its consolidated entities, and is accounted for as compensation and benefits expense. these employees are also eligible to receive discretionary cash bonuses based on performance, overall profitability and other matters. while cash bonuses paid to most employees are borne by kkr and certain consolidated entities and result in customary compensation and benefits expense, cash bonuses that are paid to certain employees are currently borne by kkr holdings. these bonuses are funded with distributions that kkr holdings receives on kkr group partnership units held by kkr holdings but are not then passed on to holders of unvested units of kkr holdings. because employees are not entitled to receive distributions on units that are unvested, any amounts allocated to employees in excess of an employee's vested equity interests are reflected as employee compensation and benefits expense. these compensation charges are recorded based on the unvested portion of quarterly earnings distributions received by kkr holdings at the time of the distribution.
with respect to kkr's active and future funds and co-investment vehicles that provide for carried interest, kkr allocates to its employees and other personnel a portion of the carried interest earned as part of its carry pool. kkr currently allocates approximately 40% of the carry it earns from these funds and vehicles to its carry pool. these amounts are accounted for as compensatory profit-sharing arrangements in conjunction with the related carried interest income and recorded as compensation and benefits expense for kkr employees and general, administrative and other expense for certain non-employee consultants and service providers in the consolidated statements of operations.
general, administrative and other general, administrative and other expense consists primarily of professional fees paid to legal advisors, accountants, advisors and consultants, insurance costs, travel and related expenses, communications and information services, depreciation and amortization charges, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, expenses incurred by oil and gas-producing entities (including impairment charges) that are consolidated and other general and operating expenses which are not borne by fund investors and are not offset by credits attributable to fund investors' noncontrolling interests in consolidated funds. general, administrative and other expense also consists of costs incurred in connection with pursuing potential investments that do not result in completed transactions, a substantial portion of which are borne by fund investors.
investment income (loss)
net gains (losses) from investment activities net gains (losses) from investment activities consist of realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from our investment activities. the majority of our net gains (losses) from investment activities are related to our private equity investments. fluctuations in net gains (losses) from investment activities between reporting periods is driven primarily by changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as well as the realization of investments. the fair value of, as well as the ability to recognize gains from, our private equity investments is significantly impacted by the global financial markets, which, in turn, affects the net gains (losses) from investment activities recognized in any given period. upon the disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains and losses are reversed and an offsetting realized gain or loss is recognized in the current period. since our investments are carried at fair value, fluctuations between periods could be significant due to changes to the inputs to our valuation process over time. for a further discussion of our fair value measurements and fair value of investments, see "critical accounting policiesfair value measurements."
dividend income dividend income consists primarily of distributions that investment funds receive from portfolio companies in which they invest. dividend income is recognized primarily in connection with (i) dispositions of operations by portfolio companies, (ii) distributions of excess cash generated from operations from portfolio companies and (iii) other significant refinancings undertaken by portfolio companies.
interest income interest income consists primarily of interest that is received on our cash balances and other investments including credit instruments in which our consolidated funds and other entities invest.
interest expense interest expense is incurred from debt issued by kkr, including debt issued by kfn which was consolidated upon completion of the acquisition of kfn, credit facilities entered into by kkr, debt securities issued by consolidated clos and financing arrangements at our consolidated funds entered into primarily with the objective of managing cash flow. kfn's debt obligations are non-recourse to kkr beyond the assets of kfn. debt securities issued by consolidated clos are supported solely by the investments held at the clo vehicles and are not collateralized by assets of any other kkr entity. our obligations under financing arrangements at our consolidated funds are generally limited to our pro-rata equity interest in such funds. our management companies bear no obligations with respect to financing arrangements at our consolidated funds. we also capitalize debt financing costs incurred in connection with new debt arrangements. such costs are amortized into interest expense using either the interest method or the straight-line method, as appropriate. see "liquidity".
income taxes the kkr group partnerships and certain of their subsidiaries operate in the united states as partnerships for u.s. federal income tax purposes and as corporate entities in non-u.s. jurisdictions. accordingly, these entities, in some cases, are subject to new york city unincorporated business taxes, or non-u.s. income taxes. furthermore, we hold our interest in one of the kkr group partnerships through kkr management holdings corp., which is treated as a corporation for u.s. federal income tax purposes, and certain other subsidiaries of the kkr group partnerships are treated as corporations for u.s. federal income tax purposes. accordingly, such subsidiaries of kkr, including kkr management holdings corp., and of the kkr group partnerships are subject to u.s. federal, state
and local corporate income taxes at the entity level and the related tax provision attributable to kkr's share of this income is reflected in the financial statements. we also generate certain interest income to our unitholders and interest deductions to kkr management holdings corp.
we use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes in accordance with gaap. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using currently enacted tax rates. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating tax positions including evaluating uncertainties. we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust our tax balances as new information becomes available.
net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the ownership interests that certain third parties hold in entities that are consolidated in the financial statements as well as the ownership interests in our kkr group partnerships that are held by kkr holdings. the allocable share of income and expense attributable to these interests is accounted for as net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. historically, the amount of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests has been substantial and has resulted in significant charges and credits in the statements of operations. given the consolidation of certain of our investment funds and the significant ownership interests in our kkr group partnerships held by kkr holdings, we expect this activity to continue.
appropriated capital appropriated capital represents the difference between the fair value of consolidated clo assets and the fair value of consolidated clo liabilities that is attributable to third party holders of the subordinated debt of consolidated clos. changes in appropriated capital result from changes in the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the consolidated clo vehicles and the amount of net income (loss) of the consolidated clos that is attributed to third party interests will be reflected in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and appropriated capital in the consolidated statements of operations to arrive at consolidated net income (loss) attributable to kkr & co. l.p.
segment operating and performance measures the segment key performance measures that follow are used by management in making operating and resource deployment decisions as well as assessing the overall performance of each of kkr's reportable business segments. the reportable segments for kkr's business are presented prior to giving effect to the allocation of income (loss) between kkr & co. l.p. and kkr holdings l.p. and as such represent the business in total. in addition, kkr's reportable segments are presented without giving effect to the consolidation of the funds or clos that kkr manages.
we disclose the following financial measures in this report that are calculated and presented using methodologies other than in accordance with gaap. we believe that providing these performance measures on a supplemental basis to our gaap results is helpful to unitholders in assessing the overall performance of kkr's businesses. these financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for similar financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap if available. we caution readers that these non-gaap financial measures may differ from the calculations of other investment managers,
and as a result, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other investment managers. reconciliations of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, where applicable, are included within "financial statements and supplementary datanote 13. segment reporting" and later in this report under "economic net income (loss)" and "segment book value."
economic net income (loss) is a measure of profitability for kkr's reportable segments and is used by management as an alternative measurement of the operating and investment earnings of kkr and its business segments. we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the overall profitability of kkr's businesses inclusive of carried interest and related carry pool allocations and investment income. eni is comprised of total segment revenues less total segment expenses and certain economic interests in kkr's segments held by third parties. eni differs from net income (loss) on a gaap basis as a result of: (i) the inclusion of management fees earned from consolidated funds that were eliminated in consolidation; (ii) the exclusion of fees and expenses of certain consolidated entities; (iii) the exclusion of charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets; (iv) the exclusion of non-cash equity-based charges and other non-cash compensation charges borne by kkr holdings or incurred under the equity incentive plan and other securities that are exchangeable for common units of kkr & co. l.p.; (v) the exclusion of certain non-recurring items; (vi) the exclusion of investment income (loss) relating to noncontrolling interests; and (vii) the exclusion of income taxes.
assets under management ("aum")
assets under management represent the assets from which kkr is entitled to receive fees or a carried interest and general partner capital. we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into kkr's capital raising activities and the overall activity in its investment funds. kkr calculates the amount of aum as of any date as the sum of: (i) the fair value of the investments of kkr's investment funds plus uncalled capital commitments from these funds; (ii) the fair value of investments in kkr's co-investment vehicles; (iii) the net asset value of certain of kkr's fixed income products; (iv) the value of outstanding clos (excluding clos wholly-owned by kkr); and (v) the fair value of other assets managed by kkr. aum excludes those assets managed by entities where kkr does not hold more than a 50% ownership interest. kkr's definition of aum is not based on any definition of aum that may be set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds, vehicles or accounts that it manages or calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions.
fee paying aum represents only those assets under management from which kkr receives management fees. we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the capital base upon which kkr earns management fees. this relates to kkr's capital raising activities and the overall activity in its investment funds or clos, for only those funds or clos where kkr receives fees (i.e., excluding vehicles that receive only carried interest or general partner capital). fpaum is the sum of all of the individual fee bases that are used to calculate kkr's fees and differs from aum in the following respects: (i) assets from which kkr does not receive a fee are excluded (i.e., assets with respect to which it receives only carried interest) and (ii) certain assets, primarily in its private equity funds, are reflected based on capital commitments and invested capital as opposed to fair value because fees are not impacted by changes in the fair value of underlying investments.
equity invested equity invested is the aggregate amount of equity capital that has been invested by kkr's investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles and is used as a measure of investment activity for kkr and its business segments during a given period. we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into kkr's investments among its investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles and replaces committed dollars invested. such amounts include: (i) capital invested by fund investors and co-investors with respect to which kkr is entitled to a carried interest and (ii) capital invested by kkr's investment funds, including investments made using investment financing arrangements.
gross dollars invested gross dollars invested is the aggregate amount of capital that has been invested by all of kkr's public markets investment vehicles in our private credit non-liquid strategies and is used as a measure of investment activity for a portion of kkr's public markets segment in a given period. we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into kkr's investment of capital across private credit non-liquid strategies for all the investment vehicles in the public markets segment. such amounts include capital invested by fund investors and co-investors with respect to which kkr's public markets business is entitled to a fee or carried interest.
syndicated capital syndicated capital is generally the aggregate amount of capital in transactions originated by kkr investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles, which has been distributed to third parties in exchange for a fee. it does not include (i) capital invested in such transactions by kkr investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles, which is instead reported in equity invested and (ii) debt capital that is arranged as part of the acquisition financing of transactions originated by kkr investment funds. syndicated capital is used as a measure of investment activity for kkr and its business segments during a given period, and we believe that this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into levels of syndication activity in kkr's capital markets and other segment and across its investment platform.
uncalled commitments uncalled commitments are used as a measure of unfunded capital commitments that kkr's investment funds and carry-paying co-investment vehicles have received from partners to contribute capital to fund future investments. we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the amount of capital that is available to kkr's investment funds to make future investments. uncalled commitments are not reduced for investments completed using fund-level investment financing arrangements.
adjusted units adjusted units are used as a measure of the total equity ownership of kkr that is held by kkr & co. l.p. (including equity awards issued under the equity incentive plan), kkr holdings and other holders of securities exchangeable into common units of kkr & co. l.p. and represent the fully diluted unit count using the if-converted method. we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides an indication of the total equity ownership of kkr as if all outstanding kkr holdings units, equity awards issued under the equity incentive plan and other exchangeable securities had been exchanged for common units of kkr & co. l.p.
segment book value book value is a measure of the net assets of kkr's reportable segments and is used by management primarily in assessing the unrealized value of kkr's investment portfolio, including carried interest, as well as kkr's overall liquidity position. we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the assets and liabilities of kkr excluding the assets and liabilities that are allocated to noncontrolling interest holders. book value differs from kkr & co. l.p. partners' capital on a gaap basis primarily as a result of the exclusion of ownership interests attributable to kkr holdings.

total investment income (loss)                                                                    6,544,748              8,896,746              (2,351,998   )

fees and other the net increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues earned by consolidated oil and gas producing entities of $164.8 million, an increase in transaction fees of $137.6 million and an increase in management fees of $37.3 million. the increase in revenue earned by consolidated oil and gas producing entities was primarily the result of the acquisition of kfn, which owned oil and gas producing entities, completed on april 30, 2014, and to a lesser extent, growth in the activities of our other consolidated oil and gas producing entities. the increase in transaction fees was primarily driven by (i) an increase in the size of fee-generating investments completed during the year ended december 31, 2014 in our private markets segment and (ii) an increase in transaction fees in our capital markets business reflecting larger transaction sizes when compared to the prior period, including a capital markets fee received from the syndication of equity in first data corporation (financial services sector) of approximately $43 million. during the year ended december 31, 2014, our private markets segment had 33 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $15.4 billion compared to 33 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $15.0 billion during the year ended december 31, 2013. transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular discussions as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and kkr's role in the transaction. the increase in management fees was primarily the result of the acquisition of avoca on february 19, 2014 and to a lesser extent new capital raised primarily in our public markets segment, partially offset by a decrease in management fees received from kfn as a result of our acquisition of kfn on april 30, 2014, as management fees from kfn after that date are now eliminated in consolidation.
expenses the increase was primarily due to an increase in general, administrative and other expenses of $430.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits of $2.7 million. the increase in general, administrative and other expenses is primarily due to an increase of approximately $330 million relating to the activities of our consolidated oil and gas producing entities which were not consolidated prior to the third quarter of 2013 as well as the activities of oil and gas producing entities acquired in the acquisition of kfn completed on april 30, 2014. this increase included an impairment charge of approximately $220 million relating to long-lived assets at our consolidated oil and gas producing entities. in addition, general, administrative, and other expenses increased as a result of (i) increased expenses attributable to avoca which we acquired on february 19, 2014, (ii) expenses incurred by consolidated clos that were consolidated subsequent to the acquisition of avoca and the acquisition of kfn, which was completed on april 30, 2014, and (iii) an increase in amounts accrued for litigation. the decrease in compensation and benefits is due primarily to (i) lower equity-based compensation reflecting fewer kkr holdings units vesting for expense recognition purposes under the graded attribution method of expense recognition, (ii) lower carry pool allocations as a result of the recognition of a lower level of carried interest during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, partially offset by (i) an increase in cash compensation reflecting a higher level of fees as well as increased headcount and (ii) higher equity-based compensation relating primarily to additional equity grants under the equity incentive plan.

the appreciation in the market value of our private equity portfolio was driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $2.2 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in our 2006 fund, european fund iii and north america fund xi, respectively. approximately 23% of the net change in value for the year ended december 31, 2014 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, the most significant of which were gains on pra health sciences, inc. (nasdaq: prah), hca, inc. (nyse: hca), nxp semiconductors n.v. (nasdaq: nxpi) and yageo corporation (tw: 2327). these increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were tarkett s.a. (fp:tktt), prosiebensat.1 media ag (xetra: psm) and rundong automobile group (hk: 1365). our privately-held investments contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to alliance boots gmbh (healthcare sector), biomet, inc. (healthcare sector) and wild flavors gmbh (consumer products sector). the unrealized gains on our privately-held investments were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to northgate information solutions (technology sector), samson resources (energy sector) and toys r us (retail sector). the unrealized gains were also offset by unrealized losses in our energy assets from our natural resources fund and
energy income and growth fund of approximately $352 million. the increased valuations of individual companies in our privately-held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, (ii) in the case of wild flavors gmbh and biomet, inc., an increase that primarily reflected agreements to sell these investments, with the sale of wild flavors gmbh completed in october 2014, and (iii) in the case of alliance boots gmbh, primarily due to an agreement to exit the investment and to a lesser extent an increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that is expected to be delivered pursuant to this agreement, which was completed on december 31, 2014. the decreased valuations of individual companies in our privately-held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. the decreased valuation of energy assets are generally related to decreases in commodity prices.
dividend income during the year ended december 31, 2014, we received dividends of $178.6 million from visma (technology sector), $171.6 million from capsugel (healthcare sector), $162.1 million from capital safety group (industrial sector), $87.7 million from wmf (consumer products sector) and an aggregate of $574.5 million of dividends from other investments. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we received dividends of $191.6 million from capsugel, $139.7 million from pets at home (consumer products sector), $113.9 million from visma, $85.6 million from tarkett s.a. (manufacturing sector), $52.0 million from santander consumer usa (financial services sector) and an aggregate of $112.7 million of dividends from other investments. significant dividends from portfolio companies are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable.
interest income the increase was primarily due to the consolidation of debt instruments held by kfn including clos, subsequent to the acquisition of kfn on april 30, 2014, as well as a net increase in the amount of credit instruments in our consolidated public markets investment vehicles, including clos acquired in the avoca acquisition on february 19, 2014.
interest expense the increase was primarily due to (i) interest expense associated with consolidated clos acquired in the avoca and kfn acquisitions which were completed on february 19, 2014 and april 30, 2014, respectively, (ii) interest expense associated with senior and subordinated debt at kfn and (iii) interest expense on our 2044 senior notes issued on may 29, 2014.
income (loss) before taxes the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in investment income and increase in expenses, partially offset by an increase in fees.
income taxes the increase was primarily due to an increase in the amount of income in the kkr group partnerships that is subject to either corporate or local taxes, or both, as well as an increase in kkr & co. l.p.'s ownership percentage in the kkr group partnerships from approximately 39.9% for the year ended december 31, 2013 to approximately 49.5% for the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase in ownership subjects a greater level of income to corporate taxes.
net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests the decrease was primarily driven by the termination of our kkr equity strategies fund and to a lesser extent decreased investment income for funds and vehicles where noncontrolling interests are redeemable.
net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and appropriated capital the decrease was primarily attributable to the overall decrease in investment income described above as well as a decrease in kkr holdings's ownership percentage in the kkr group partnerships from approximately 60.1% for the year ended december 31, 2013 to approximately 50.5% for the year ended december 31, 2014.
the decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in income before taxes as described above, partially offset by an increase in kkr & co. l.p.'s ownership percentage in the kkr group partnerships from approximately 39.9% for the year ended december 31, 2013 to approximately 49.5% for the year ended december 31, 2014. this increase in ownership percentage was principally the result of the issuance of kkr common units in connection with the acquisition of kfn.

net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and appropriated capital              7,100,747              7,432,445              (331,698   )
fees and other the net increase was primarily due to an increase in management fees of $79.8 million, an increase in transaction fees of $50.3 million and an increase in incentive fees of $24.8 million. the increase in management fees was primarily the result of the acquisition of prisma as well as new capital raised primarily in our public markets segment. the increase in transaction fees was primarily driven by an increase in the size and number of fee-generating investments completed during the year ended december 31, 2013 in our private markets segment. during the year ended december 31, 2013, there were 33 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $15.0 billion compared to 17 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $6.5 billion during the year ended december 31, 2012. transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular discussions as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and kkr's role in the transaction. the increase in incentive fees is due primarily to an increase in incentive fees received from kkr prisma, which became part of kkr during the three months ended december 31, 2012, partially offset by a decrease in incentive fees from kfn as a result of its investment performance. kfn has already realized a substantial majority of the unrealized gains that were embedded in its bank loan and high yield portfolio, which have contributed in the past to its investment performance and kkr's receipt of incentive fees from kfn. incentive fees from kfn are determined quarterly, while other incentive fees are typically determined for the twelve-month periods ending in either the second and fourth quarters of the calendar year. however, such fees may be determined at other points during the year for certain strategies. whether an incentive fee from kfn and other kkr vehicles is payable in any given period, and the amount of an incentive fee payment, if any, depends on the investment performance of the vehicle and as a result may vary significantly from period to period. on april 30, 2014, kfn was acquired and from that date forward, management and incentive fees earned from kfn were eliminated.
expenses the increase was primarily due to an increase in general, administrative and other expenses of $179.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits expenses of $14.3 million. the increase in other general, administrative and other expenses was primarily due to an increase in professional service fees in connection with the growth of our business, the acquisition of prisma as well as a $9.7 million one-time expense incurred in our public markets business in connection with the launch of a closed-end fund during the year ended december 31, 2013. the net decrease in compensation and benefits is due primarily to (i) lower equity-based compensation reflecting fewer kkr holdings units vesting for expense recognition purposes under the graded attribution method of expense recognition, partially offset by (ii) an increase in cash-based compensation as a result of the prisma acquisition, increased headcount and an increase in fees and (iii) higher equity-based compensation relating to additional equity grants under the equity incentive plan.

the most significant driver of net gains (losses) from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2013 is related to unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value in our private equity investments. the net unrealized investment gains in our private equity portfolio were driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $3.0 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion in our 2006 fund, european fund ii and european fund iii, respectively. approximately 46% of the net change in value for the year ended december 31, 2013 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, most notably increases in hca, inc., prosiebensat.1 media ag and nxp semiconductors n.v., partially offset by decreases relating to bharti infratel ltd. (in: bhin) and china outfitters holdings (hk: 1146). our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributors being unrealized gains relating to alliance boots gmbh, academy sports and outdoors (retail sector) and oriental brewery (consumer products sector). the unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to samson resources, toys r us and u.n ro-ro isletmeleri a.s. (transportation sector). the increased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance and (ii) in the case of alliance boots gmbh, in part due to the increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that may be delivered pursuant to a previously announced transaction, which was completed on december 31, 2014. the decreased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook.
the most significant driver of net gains (losses) from investment activities in our private equity investments for the year ended december 31, 2012 is related to unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value. the net unrealized investment gains in our private equity portfolio were driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $3.4 billion, $1.9 billion and $0.9 billion in our 2006 fund, european fund ii and asian fund, respectively. approximately 24% of the net change in value for the year ended december 31, 2012 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed
investments, most notably increases in hca, inc., dollar general corporation (nyse: dg) and nxp semiconductors n.v., which were partially offset by decreases in seven west media ltd. (ax: swm), far east horizon ltd. (hk: 3360) and tianrui cement co., ltd. (hk: 1252). our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributors being unrealized gains relating to alliance boots gmbh, oriental brewery and kion group gmbh (manufacturing sector), which were partially offset by unrealized losses on samson resources, china international capital corporation (financial services sector) and toys r us. the increased valuations are generally related to an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, and in the case of alliance boots gmbh, an increase that primarily reflected the valuation of an agreement to sell a portion of the investment executed in june 2012, which was completed on december 31, 2014. the decreased valuations are generally related to an unfavorable business outlook for the respective companies.
dividend income during the year ended december 31, 2013, we received dividends of $191.6 million from capsugel, $139.7 million from pets at home, $113.9 million from visma, $85.6 million from tarkett s.a., $52.0 million from santander consumer usa and an aggregate of $112.7 million of dividends from other investments. during the year ended december 31, 2012, we received $520.0 million of dividends from hca, inc., $188.1 million from academy sports and outdoors, $95.0 million from sungard (technology sector), $78.5 million from tdc a/s (omx: tdc), and an aggregate of $59.3 million of dividends from other investments. significant dividends from portfolio companies are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable. significant dividends from portfolio companies are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable.
interest income the increase primarily reflects a net increase in the level of credit instruments in our public markets investment vehicles.
interest expense the increase was primarily due to an increase in debt obligations in connection with our 2043 senior notes issued on february 1, 2013.
income (loss) before taxes the decrease was primarily due to the factors described above, principally a decrease in dividends in investment income, an increase in expenses, partially offset by an increase in fees.
net income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests the increase primarily reflects a higher level of investment income in vehicles that allow for redemptions by their limited partners.
net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and appropriated capital the decrease was primarily driven by the overall changes in the components of net gains (losses) from investment activities described above as well as a decrease in kkr holdings's ownership percentage in the kkr group partnerships from approximately 65.2% for the year ended december 31, 2012 to approximately 60.1% for the year ended december 31, 2013.
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in kkr & co. l.p.'s ownership percentage in the kkr group partnerships from 36.9% on december 31, 2012 to 41.6% on december 31, 2013.
segment analysis the following is a discussion of the results of our three reportable business segments for years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. you should read this discussion in conjunction with the information included under "basis of financial presentationsegment operating and performance measures" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.
in connection with kkr's acquisition of kfn on april 30, 2014, and the related increase in the amount of assets held by kkr, kkr's management reevaluated the manner in which it makes operational and resource deployment decisions and assesses the overall performance of each of kkr's operating segments. as a result, since june 30, 2014, kkr has modified the presentation of its segment financial information.
certain of the more significant changes between kkr's current segment presentation and its previously reported segment presentation reported prior to june 30, 2014, are as follows:
 all income on investments is now attributed to either the private markets segment or public markets segment based on the character of the income generated. for example, gains from private equity investments are included in the private markets segment. previously, income on investments held directly by kkr was reported in the capital markets and principal activities segment.
 carried interest and other investment income (both realized and unrealized) is now included in total segment revenues as opposed to investment income.
 total segment expenses now include allocation to carry pool within compensation and benefits (both realized and unrealized), as opposed to such amounts being included in investment income.
 the capital markets and principal activities segment has been renamed capital markets and other.
in connection with these modifications, segment information for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012 has been presented in this annual report on form 10-k to conform to kkr's current segment presentation. consequently, this information will not be consistent with historical segment financial results previously reported. while the modified segment presentation impacted the amount of economic net income reported by each operating segment, it had no impact on kkr's economic net income on a total reportable segment basis.

segment revenues management, monitoring and transaction fees, net the net increase was primarily due to an increase in transaction fees of $64.5 million, partially offset by an increase in fee credits of $62.0 million. the increase in transaction fees was attributable to an increase in the size of fee-generating investments completed. during the year ended december 31,
2014, there were 33 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $15.4 billion compared to 33 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $15.0 billion during the year ended december 31, 2013. transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular discussions as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and kkr's role in the transaction. the increase in fee credits is primarily attributable to the increase in transaction fees, as described above. see also discussion under "assets under management" and "fee-paying assets under management".
performance income the net decrease primarily reflects a lower level of unrealized appreciation in our private equity portfolio in the 2014 period than in the 2013 period. while the value of our private equity portfolio increased in the 2014 period, the amount of appreciation was less than that in the prior period.
realized carried interest for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 and consisted primarily of realized gains from the sales of oriental brewery, wild flavors gmbh and versatel gmbh (telecom sector).
realized carried interest for the year ended december 31, 2013 consisted primarily of realized gains from the partial sale and final sale of dollar general corporation, the partial sale of hca, inc. and sale of intelligence, ltd. (services sector).
the following table presents net unrealized carried interest by investment vehicle for the year ended december 31, 2014 and 2013:
co-investment vehicles and other               99,026               22,009
management fee refunds                        (13,931   )          (30,282   )
the above table excludes any funds for which there was no unrealized carried interest during either of the periods presented.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, the net unrealized carried interest income of $70.1 million included $1,098.2 million representing net increases in the value of various portfolio companies, which were partially offset by unrealized losses of $1,028.1 million primarily representing reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial or full sales and management fee refunds.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, the value of our private equity investment portfolio increased 12.8%. increased share prices of various publicly held investments comprised approximately 23% of the net increase in value for the year ended december 31, 2014, the most significant of which were gains on pra health sciences, inc., hca, inc., nxp semiconductors n.v. and yageo corporation. these increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were tarkett s.a., prosiebensat.1 media ag and rundong automobile group. our privately-held investments contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to alliance boots gmbh, biomet, inc. and wild flavors gmbh. the unrealized gains on our privately-held investments were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to northgate information solutions, samson resources and toys r us. the increased valuations of individual companies in our privately-held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, (ii) in the case of wild flavors gmbh and biomet, inc., an increase that primarily reflected agreements to sell these investments, with the sale of wild flavors gmbh completed in october 2014, and (iii) in the case of alliance boots gmbh, primarily due to an agreement to exit the investment and to a lesser extent an increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that is expected to be delivered pursuant to this agreement, which was completed on december 31, 2014. the decreased valuations of individual companies in our privately-held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook.
the reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains for the year ended december 31, 2014 resulted primarily from the sale of oriental brewery, the sale of wild flavors gmbh, the partial sale of hca, inc. and the sale of jazz pharmaceuticals, inc. (nasdaq: jazz). during the year ended december 31, 2014, we wrote off a.t.u auto-teile-unger (retail sector) and u.n ro-ro isletmeleri a.s. and recognized realized losses. these 2014 write-offs did not have a significant impact on our 2014 net carried interest because these interests had already been substantially written down in prior periods.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, the unrealized carried interest gain of $661.8 million included $1,174.6 million reflecting net increases in the value of various portfolio companies, which were partially offset by $512.8 million primarily representing reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial or full sales and management fee refunds.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, the value of our private equity investment portfolio increased 20.2%. increased share prices of various publicly held investments comprised approximately 46% of the net increase in value for the year ended december 31, 2013, the most significant of which were gains on hca, inc., prosiebensat.1 media ag and nxp semiconductors n.v. these increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were bharti infratel ltd. and china outfitters holdings. our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to alliance boots gmbh, academy sports and outdoors and oriental brewery. the unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to toys r us, samson resources, and u.n ro-ro isletmeleri a.s. the increased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance and (ii) in the case of alliance boots gmbh, in part due to the increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that may be delivered pursuant to a previously announced transaction, which was completed on december 31, 2014. the decreased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook.
the reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains for the year ended december 31, 2013 resulted primarily from the partial sales and final sale of dollar general corporation, the partial sales
of hca, inc. and sale of intelligence, ltd. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we wrote off pagesjaunes group (media sector) (currently known as solocal group sa (fra: qs3)) and our remaining warrants in eastman kodak (technology sector) and sold our remaining investment in seven west media ltd. realizing a modest loss. none of these write-offs had a material impact on our 2013 net carried interest because these interests had already been substantially written down in prior periods.
investment income the net decrease is primarily due to a decrease in unrealized gains of $497.7 million and realized gains of $22.4 million, which were partially offset by an increase in net interest and dividends of $99.1 million.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, net realized gains were comprised primarily of gains from the sale of private equity investments, including the sale and partial sale of hca, inc., nxp semiconductors n.v. and the nielsen company b.v. (nyse: nlsn). net unrealized losses are primarily related to the reversal of gains on sales of investments noted in the realized gains commentary above as well as declines in value of various investments in working interests in oil and gas producing properties and samson resources. for the year ended december 31, 2014, mark-to-market unrealized losses reflected in net unrealized losses relating to our energy investments in working interests in oil and gas producing properties were approximately $149 million, the majority of which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily as a result of a decline in oil prices. these unrealized losses and reversals of gains upon realization events were partially offset by increases in value of various private equity investments including first data corporation, alliance boots gmbh and biomet, inc.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, net realized gains were comprised primarily of realized gains from the sale or partial sale of private equity investments, the most significant of which were hca, inc., dollar general corporation, nxp semiconductors n.v. and intelligence, ltd. these realized gains were partially offset by realized losses primarily related to the sale and write off of private equity investments, including the write-off of pagesjaunes group. realized investment losses from balance sheet investments that were already written down as of october 1, 2009 that have been excluded from net realized gains (losses) above amounted to approximately $205 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the net unrealized gains related primarily to increases in the value of various private equity investments, most notably hca, inc., prosiebensat.1 media ag and alliance boots gmbh, partially offset by unrealized losses on samson resources, as well as reversals of unrealized gains primarily in connection with the sales of the investments noted in the realized gains commentary above.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, net interest and dividends were comprised of (i) $37.2 million of interest income which consists primarily of interest that is received from our cash balances and other assets, (ii) $134.0 million of dividend income from distributions received through our investment funds and other assets, including approximately $84 million received from our energy investments in working interests in oil and gas producing properties and (iii) $80.7 million of interest expense primarily relating to the senior notes outstanding for kkr and kfn, a portion of which are allocable to the private markets segment. for the year ended december 31, 2013, net interest and dividends were comprised of (i) $14.2 million of interest income which consists primarily of interest received on our cash balances, (ii) $35.3 million of dividend income from distributions received through our investment funds and other assets and (iii) $58.2 million of interest expense primarily relating to the senior notes outstanding for kkr, a portion of which is allocable to the private markets segment. the increase from the prior period is primarily due to an increase in dividend income in our private equity and energy investments portfolio, partially offset by higher allocations of interest expense to the private markets segment as a result of our 2044 senior notes issued on may 29, 2014 as well as interest expense relating to debt obligations at kfn subsequent to kkr's acquisition of it on april 30, 2014.
segment expenses compensation and benefits the net decrease was due primarily to lower allocations to carry pool driven by the lower levels of unrealized carried interest, partially offset by an increase in realized carried interest and higher cash compensation and benefits primarily reflecting increased headcount and to a lesser extent a higher level of fees, which generally results in higher compensation expenses in the year ended december 31, 2014.
occupancy and other operating expenses the net increase was primarily driven by an increase in expenses for unconsummated transactions, also known as "broken deal" expenses, and to a lesser extent an increase in professional fee expenses reflecting the overall growth of this segment.
this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in investment income and the decrease in performance income, partially offset by increases in management, monitoring and transaction fees, net and a decrease in segment expenses as described above.
assets under management the following table reflects the changes in our private markets aum from december 31, 2013 to december 31, 2014:
new capital raised                                       6,056,000
net changes in fee base of certain funds                  (933,800   )
change in value                                          5,865,500
aum for the private markets segment was $61.5 billion at december 31, 2014, an increase of $0.3 billion, compared to $61.2 billion at december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to new capital raised of $6.1 billion and appreciation in the market value of our private equity portfolio of $5.9 billion. these increases were partially offset by distributions to private equity fund investors of $10.7 billion comprised of $7.3 billion of realized gains and $3.4 billion of return of original cost.
the appreciation in the market value of our private equity portfolio was driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $2.2 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in our 2006 fund, european fund iii and north america fund xi, respectively. approximately 23% of the net change in value for the year ended december 31, 2014 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, the most significant of which were gains on pra health sciences, inc., hca, inc., nxp semiconductors n.v. and yageo corporation. these increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were tarkett s.a., prosiebensat.1 media ag and rundong automobile group. our privately-held investments contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to alliance boots gmbh, biomet, inc. and wild flavors gmbh. the unrealized gains on our privately-held investments were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to northgate information solutions, samson resources and toys r us. the unrealized gains were also offset by unrealized losses in our energy assets from our natural resources fund and energy income and
growth fund of approximately $352 million. the increased valuations of individual companies in our privately-held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, (ii) in the case of wild flavors gmbh and biomet, inc., an increase that primarily reflected agreements to sell these investments, with the sale of wild flavors gmbh completed in october 2014, and (iii) in the case of alliance boots gmbh, primarily due to an agreement to exit the investment and to a lesser extent an increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that is expected to be delivered pursuant to this agreement, which was completed on december 31, 2014. the decreased valuations of individual companies in our privately-held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. the decreased valuation of energy assets are generally related to decreases in commodity prices.
as of december 31, 2014, our aum excluded approximately $0.3 billion of unallocated commitments from a strategic partnership with a state pension plan, and $2.8 billion in commitments in connection with other infrastructure, energy, private equity and co-investment vehicles for which we are currently not earning management fees or carried interest. such commitments will not contribute to aum unless and until we are entitled to receive fees or carried interest in accordance with our definition of aum.
fee-paying assets under management the following table reflects the changes in our private markets fpaum from december 31, 2013 to december 31, 2014:
new capital raised                                      5,298,500
net changes in fee base of certain funds                 (964,700   )
change in value                                          (393,800   )
fpaum in our private markets segment was $47.3 billion at december 31, 2014, a decrease of $2.9 billion, compared to $50.2 billion at december 31, 2013. the decrease was primarily attributable to (i) distributions to private equity fund investors, (ii) a reduction in fpaum attributable to the invested capital of energy future holdings due to its bankruptcy and (iii) a reduction reflecting the impact of our european fund iii entering its post-investment period. this decrease was partially offset by new capital raised of $5.3 billion relating primarily to additional capital raised in our infrastructure investors fund ii, european fund iv and capital deployed in our 2006 fund which earns fees on invested capital in its post-investment period.
as of december 31, 2014, fpaum excluded approximately $0.3 billion of unallocated commitments from a strategic partnership with a state pension plan and $2.8 billion in commitments in connection with infrastructure, energy, private equity and co-investment vehicles for which we are currently not earning management fees or carried interest. once these committed amounts are invested, management fees will begin to be earned with respect to such amounts, which will be accretive to our fees. such commitments will not contribute to fpaum unless and until we are entitled to receive management fees in accordance with our definition of fpaum.
equity invested the increase was due to an increase in the number and size of private equity investments closed during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared with the year ended december 31, 2013. generally, the operating companies acquired through our private equity business have higher transaction values and result in higher equity invested, relative to transactions in our real assets businesses. the number of large private equity investments made in any quarter is volatile and consequently, a significant amount of equity invested in one quarter or a few quarters may not be indicative of a similar level of capital deployment in future quarters. for the year ended december 31, 2014, there were 96 transactions with a total combined transaction value of approximately $21.8 billion compared to 70 transactions with a total combined transaction value of approximately $17.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013.
uncalled commitments as of december 31, 2014, our private markets segment had $18.3 billion of remaining uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions.

segment revenues management, monitoring and transaction fees, net the net increase was primarily due to an increase in transaction fees of $53.7 million and an increase in management fees of $35.6 million, partially offset by an increase in fee credits of $39.3 million. the increase in transaction fees was attributable to an increase in both the size and number of fee-generating investments completed. during the year ended december 31, 2013, there were 33 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $15.0 billion compared to 17 transaction fee-generating investments with a total
combined transaction value of approximately $6.5 billion during the year ended december 31, 2012. transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular discussions as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and kkr's role in the transaction. the increase in fee credits is primarily attributable to the increase in transaction fees, as described above. the increase in management fees is primarily attributable to new capital raised in kkr north america fund xi and kkr asian fund ii, partially offset by the kkr 2006 fund and kkr asian fund entering their post-investment periods with a lower management fee. as of december 31, 2013, fpaum excluded approximately $0.7 billion of unallocated commitments from a strategic partnership with a state pension plan and $2.2 billion in commitments in connection with infrastructure, energy, private equity and co-investment vehicles for which we are currently not earning management fees or carried interest. the inclusion of these amounts in fpaum in future periods would be accretive to our fees. the investment period of our european fund iii ended on march 31, 2014, which reduced the fund's fee rate and changed the fund's management fee base from committed capital to invested capital. this resulted in a decrease in fees earned for european fund iii beginning in the second quarter of 2014. this decrease was not offset by a successor european private equity fund until such time as the successor fund has its first close and commenced its investment period, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014.
performance income this increase was primarily driven by a lower level of management fee refunds.
management fee refunds amounted to $30.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, a decrease of $113.4 million, as compared to $143.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. the decrease in management fee refunds primarily reflects an increased level of accrued carried interest in european fund iii and european fund ii in the year ended 2012 which triggered the recognition of a higher level of management fee refunds in that period.
realized carried interest for the year ended december 31, 2013 consisted primarily of realized gains from the partial sale and final sale of dollar general corporation, the partial sales of hca, inc. and sale of intelligence, ltd.
realized carried interest for the year ended december 31, 2012 consisted primarily of realized gains from the partial sale of alliance boots gmbh, sale of legrand holdings s.a. (enxtpa: lr) and partial sale of hca, inc.

the above table excludes any funds for which there was no unrealized carried interest during either of the periods presented, which for the year ended december 31, 2013, consisted of asian fund ii.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, the net unrealized carried interest gain of $661.8 million included $1,174.6 million representing net increases in the value of various portfolio companies which were partially offset by $512.8 million primarily representing reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in the connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial or full sales and management fee refunds.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, the value of our private equity investment portfolio increased 20.2%. increased share prices of various publicly held investments comprised approximately 46% of the net increase in value for the year ended december 31, 2013, the most significant of which were gains on hca, inc., prosiebensat.1 media ag and nxp semiconductors n.v. these increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were bharti infratel ltd. and china outfitters holdings. our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to alliance boots gmbh, academy sports and outdoors and oriental brewery. the unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to toys r us, samson resources, and u.n ro-ro isletmeleri a.s. the increased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance and (ii) in the case of alliance boots gmbh, in part due to the increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that may be delivered pursuant to a previously announced transaction, which was completed on december 31, 2014. the decreased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook.
the reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains for the year ended december 31, 2013 resulted primarily from the partial sales and final sale of dollar general corporation, the partial sales of hca, inc. and sale of intelligence, ltd. during the year ended december 31, 2013, we wrote off pagesjaunes group and our remaining warrants in eastman kodak and sold our remaining investment
for the year ended december 31, 2012, the net unrealized carried interest gain of $773.3 million included $1,141.1 million attributable to net increases in the value of various portfolio companies, partially offset by $367.8 million of reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial or full sales of investments and management fee refunds.
of the $1,141.1 million of net increases in value, 24% was attributable to increased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were gains on hca, inc., dollar general corporation and nxp semiconductors n.v. these increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of other publicly held investments, the most significant of which were seven west media ltd., far east horizon ltd., and tianrui cement co., ltd. our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to alliance boots gmbh, oriental brewery and kion group gmbh. the unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses relating to samson resources, china international capital corporation, and toys r us. the increased valuations are generally related to an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, and in the case of alliance boots gmbh, an increase that primarily reflected the valuation of an agreement to sell a portion of the investment executed in june 2012, which was completed on december 31, 2014. the decreased valuations are generally related to an unfavorable business outlook for the respective companies.
the reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains for the year ended december 31, 2012 resulted primarily from the partial sale of alliance boots gmbh, sale of legrand holdings s.a. and partial sale of hca, inc.
investment income the net decrease is primarily due to a decrease in net interest and dividends of $132.6 million and realized gains of $71.7 million which was partially offset by an increase in unrealized gains of $25.3 million.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, net realized gains were comprised primarily of realized gains from the sale or partial sale of private equity investments, the most significant of which were hca, inc., dollar general corporation, nxp semiconductors n.v. and intelligence, ltd. these realized gains were partially offset by realized losses primarily related to the sale and write off of private equity investments, including the write-off of pagesjaunes group. realized investment losses from balance sheet investments that were already written down as of october 1, 2009 that have been excluded from net realized gains (losses) above amounted to approximately $205 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the net unrealized gains related primarily to increases in the value of various private equity investments, most notably hca, inc., prosiebensat.1 media ag and alliance boots gmbh, partially offset by unrealized losses on samson resources, as well as reversals of unrealized gains primarily in connection with the sales of the investments noted in the realized gains commentary above.
for the year ended december 31, 2012, net realized gains were comprised primarily of gains from the sale of private equity investments, the most significant of which were the partial sales of dollar general corporation, alliance boots gmbh and hca, inc. these realized gains were partially offset by realized losses primarily in connection with the sale of certain of our private equity interests. the net unrealized gains related primarily to increases in the value of various private equity investments, most notably alliance boots gmbh, hca, inc., kion group gmbh, and dollar general corporation. these unrealized gains were partially offset by unrealized losses on samson resources, as
well as reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in the connection with the occurrence of realization events as described above.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, net interest and dividends were comprised of (i) $14.2 million of interest income which consists primarily of interest received on our cash balances, (ii) $35.3 million of dividend income from distributions received through our investment funds and other assets and (iii) $58.2 million of interest expense primarily relating to the senior notes outstanding for kkr, a portion of which is allocable to the private markets segment. for the year ended december 31, 2012, net interest and dividends were comprised of (i) $14.8 million of interest income which consists primarily of interest received on our cash balances, (ii) $140.6 million of dividend income from distributions received through our investment funds and other assets and (iii) $31.4 million of interest expense primarily relating to the senior notes outstanding for kkr. the decrease from the prior period is primarily due to a decrease in dividend income in our private equity portfolio as well as higher allocations of interest expense to the private markets segment as a result of our 2043 senior notes issued on february 1, 2013.
segment expenses compensation and benefits this increase was due primarily to higher cash compensation and benefits reflecting a higher level of fees, which generally results in higher compensation expense, as well as increased head count.
the decrease in investment income as described above, partially offset by the increase in performance income and management, monitoring and transaction fees, was the primary contributor to the period over period decrease in economic net income.

aum for the private markets segment was $61.2 billion at december 31, 2013, an increase of $12.1 billion, compared to $49.1 billion at december 31, 2012. the increase was primarily attributable to (i) new capital raised of $13.6 billion relating primarily to asian fund ii commencing its investment period at which time it began recognizing management fees as well as additional capital raised in north america fund xi, energy income and growth fund and real estate partners americas and
(ii) appreciation in the market value of our private equity portfolio of $7.9 billion. the increases were partially offset by $9.2 billion in distributions to private equity fund investors comprised of $6.0 billion of realized gains and $3.2 billion of return of original cost.
the appreciation in the market value of our private equity portfolio were driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $3.0 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion in our 2006 fund, european fund ii and european fund iii, respectively. approximately 46% of the net change in value for the year ended december 31, 2013 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, most notably increases in hca, inc., prosiebensat.1 media ag and nxp semiconductors n.v., partially offset by decreases relating to bharti infratel ltd and china outfitters holdings. our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributors being unrealized gains relating to alliance boots gmbh, academy sports and outdoors and oriental brewery. the unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to samson resources, toys r us and u.n ro-ro isletmeleri a.s. the increased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance and (ii) in the case of alliance boots gmbh, in part due to the increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that may be delivered pursuant to a previously announced transaction, which was completed on december 31, 2014. the decreased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook.

segment revenues management, monitoring and transaction fees, net the net increase was primarily due to an increase in management fees of $66.7 million and a decrease in fee credits of $6.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in transaction fees of $13.2 million. the increase in management fees is due primarily to our acquisition of avoca on february 19, 2014 and new capital raised, primarily in our special situations strategies, corporate capital trust (a bdc sub-advised by kkr) and our hedge fund of funds platform. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in management fees received from kfn as a result of our acquisition of it on april 30, 2014 as management fees from kfn after that date are eliminated from segment results. the decrease in transaction fees is due primarily to a decrease in the size of fee earning transactions in the current period. the decrease in fee credits is due primarily to the decrease in transaction fees as described above.
performance income this decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in incentive fees of $24.6 million and a lower level of unrealized carried interest of $22.3 million, partially offset by a higher level of realized carried interest of $34.7 million. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we realized $34.7 million of carried interest from two alternative credit accounts. the decrease in incentive fees is due to a decrease in investment income in our hedge funds business and loss of incentive fees received from kfn as a result of our acquisition of it on april 30, 2014, partially offset by an increase in incentive fees received from avoca following our acquisition of avoca on february 19, 2014, and corporate capital trust resulting from favorable performance. incentive fees are typically determined for the twelve-month periods ending in either the second or fourth quarters of the calendar year, however, such fees may be determined at other points during the year for certain strategies. whether an incentive fee from kkr vehicles is payable in any given period, and the amount of an incentive fee payment, if any, depends on the investment performance of the vehicle and as a result are expected to vary significantly from period to period. the decrease in unrealized carried interest was primarily driven by the reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains for the year ended december 31, 2014, partially offset by an increase in unrealized carried interest across our carry-earning funds, the most significant of which were in our special situations strategy.
investment income the net decrease was primarily due to a decrease in total realized and unrealized gains of $180.0 million, partially offset by an increase in net interest and dividends of $142.5 million. the decrease in total realized and unrealized gains was due primarily to unrealized losses from reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains and to overall reductions in value of our investments in clos, driven primarily by a decrease in the market value of underlying collateral, and specialty finance holdings, including those acquired in our acquisition of kfn, partially offset by realized gains from the sale of assets in our kkr equity strategies fund when it was terminated. the increase in interest and dividends is due primarily to more significant levels of investments in interest yielding clos and credit investments as a result of our acquisition of kfn on april 30, 2014 and to a lesser extent our acquisition of avoca on february 19, 2014.
segment expenses compensation and benefits the increase was primarily due to (i) higher compensation expenses relating to avoca, which was acquired on february 19, 2014, (ii) higher allocations to carry pool driven by the higher levels of net
carried interest, as described above and (iii) an increase in compensation and benefits in connection with the increase in fees, which generally results in higher compensation expense.
occupancy and other operating expenses this decrease was due to the net effect of a $9.7 million one-time expense incurred in connection with the launch of a closed end fund in the 2013 period which was partially offset in the 2014 period by the operating expenses of avoca, which we acquired on february 19, 2014.
the decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in investment income, increase in segment expenses and decrease in performance income, partially offset by the increase in management fees.

aum in our public markets segment totaled $37.1 billion at december 31, 2014, an increase of $4.0 billion compared to aum of $33.1 billion at december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of avoca, which contributed $8.4 billion of aum, as well as $7.3 billion of new capital raised. these increases were partially offset by the acquisition of kfn, which reduced aum by $4.5 billion, and $7.3 billion of distributions and redemptions from certain investment vehicles, the most significant of which were from our hedge fund of funds platform and clos.

fpaum in our public markets segment was $35.8 billion at december 31, 2014, an increase of $8.6 billion compared to fpaum of $27.2 billion at december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of avoca, which contributed $8.0 billion of fpaum, $6.3 billion of new capital raised and $2.6 billion of clos partially owned by kkr that were not previously included in fpaum and was not new capital raised during the period (included in other above). these increases were partially offset by the acquisition of kfn, which reduced fpaum by $2.7 billion, and $5.2 billion of redemptions and distributions from certain investment vehicles, the most significant of which were from our clos and hedge fund of funds platform.
equity invested the increase is primarily due to a higher level of net capital deployed, primarily in our special situations and direct lending strategies partially offset by a lower level of capital deployed in our mezzanine strategy.
uncalled commitments as of december 31, 2014, our public markets segment had $2.8 billion of uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions.
gross dollars invested the increase is primarily due to a higher level of investment activity in our special situations and direct lending strategies, partially offset by a decrease in investment activity in our mezzanine strategies.

segment revenues management, monitoring and transaction fees, net the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in management fees of $100.9 million. the increase in management fees is due primarily to a full year of results for kkr prisma being reflected in 2013, the impact of our investment in nephila, which was made during 2013 and new capital raised.
performance income the increase in incentive fees is due primarily to (i) an increase in incentive fees received from kkr prisma, which became part of kkr during the year ended december 31, 2012, (ii) incentive fees relating to our investment in nephila and (iii) incentive fees from our kkr equity strategies platform. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in incentive fees from kfn as a result of its investment performance. kfn has already realized a substantial majority of the unrealized gains that were embedded in its bank loan and high yield portfolio, which have contributed in the past to its investment performance and kkr's receipt of incentive fees from kfn. incentive fees from kfn are determined quarterly, while other incentive fees are typically determined for the twelve-month periods ending in either the second or fourth quarters of the calendar year, however, such fees may be determined at other points during the year for certain strategies. whether an incentive fee from kfn and other kkr vehicles is payable in any given period, and the amount of an incentive fee payment, if any, depends on the investment performance of the vehicle and as a result may vary significantly from period to period. the increase in unrealized carried interest is primarily attributable to higher net carried interest resulting from a larger increase in the net asset values of certain carry-eligible investment vehicles in the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the prior period. on april 30, 2014, kfn was acquired and from that date forward, management and incentive fees earned from kfn were eliminated.
investment income the net increase was primarily due to an increase in total realized and unrealized gains of $11.5 million and an increase in net interest and dividends of $3.9 million. the increase in total realized and unrealized gains was due primarily to higher net overall appreciation in the value of our credit holdings, during 2013. the increase in interest and dividends is due primarily to a higher level of interest bearing credit investments in the 2013 period.
segment expenses compensation and benefits the increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in compensation and benefits from kkr prisma, which became part of kkr during the three months ended december 31, 2012 and (ii) higher allocations to carry pool driven by the higher levels of net carried interest, as described above.
occupancy and other operating expenses the increase was primarily due to (i) the expenses of kkr prisma, which became part of kkr during the three months ended december 31, 2012, (ii) a $9.7 million one-time expense incurred in our public markets business in connection with the launch of a closed-end fund and (iii) to a lesser extent an increase in operating expenses reflecting the continued growth of our public markets business.
the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in management fees, performance income and investment income, partially offset by the increase in segment expenses.

segment balance sheet our segment balance sheet serves as a significant source of capital to further grow and expand our business, increase our participation in our existing businesses and further align our interests with those of our fund investors and other stakeholders. the majority of our balance sheet consist of general partner interests in kkr investment funds, limited partner interests in certain kkr investment funds, co-investments in certain portfolio companies of kkr private equity funds and interests in clos, corporate loans, debt securities and energy and real estate assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of kfn on april 30, 2014. our balance sheet also holds other assets used in the development of our business, including seed capital for new strategies.
investments investments is a term used solely for purposes of financial presentation of a portion of kkr's balance sheet and includes majority investments in subsidiaries that operate kkr's asset management and other businesses, including the general partner interests of kkr's investment funds.
cash and short-term investments cash and short-term investments represent cash and liquid short-term investments in high-grade, short-duration cash management strategies used by kkr to generate additional yield on our excess liquidity and is used by management in evaluating kkr's liquidity position. we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into kkr's available liquidity. cash and short-term investments differ from cash and cash equivalents on a gaap basis as a result of the inclusion of liquid short-term investments in cash and short-term investments. the impact that these liquid short-term investments have on cash and cash equivalents on a gaap basis is reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows within cash flows from operating activities. accordingly, the exclusion of these investments from cash and cash equivalents on a gaap basis has no impact on cash provided (used) by operating activities, investing activities or financing activities. as of december 31, 2014, we had cash and short-term investments on a segment basis of approximately $1.1 billion. excluding approximately $0.2 billion of liquid short-term investments, cash and short-term investments may be reconciled to cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.9 billion as of december 31, 2014.

liquidity we manage our liquidity and capital requirements by focusing on our cash flows before the consolidation of our funds and clos and the effect of normal changes in short term assets and liabilities, which we anticipate will be settled for cash within one year. our primary cash flow activities on a segment basis typically involve: (i) generating cash flow from operations; (ii) generating income from investment activities, by investing in investments that generate yield (namely interest and dividends) as well as the sale of investments and other assets; (iii) funding capital commitments that we have made to our funds and clos, (iv) developing and funding new investment strategies, investment products and other growth initiatives, including acquisitions; (v) underwriting and funding commitments in our capital markets business; (vi) distributing cash flow to our fund investors and unitholders and holders of certain exchangeable securities; and (vii) borrowings, interest payments and repayments under credit agreements, our senior notes and other borrowing arrangements. as of december 31, 2014, we had cash and short-term investments on a segment basis of $1.1 billion.
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity consist of amounts received from: (i) our operating activities, including the fees earned from our funds, managed accounts, portfolio companies, and capital markets transactions; (ii) realizations on carried interest from our investment funds; (iii) interest and dividends from investments that generate yield, including our investments in clo entities; (iv) realizations on and sales of investments and other assets; and (v) borrowings under our credit facilities, debt offerings and other borrowing arrangements. in addition, we may generate cash proceeds from sales of our common units described below.
with respect to our private equity funds, carried interest is distributed to the general partner of a private equity fund with a clawback or net loss sharing provision only after all of the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred (e.g., sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its inception, in excess of performance hurdles where applicable; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost, cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments' fair value. as of december 31, 2014, certain of our funds had met the first and second criteria, as described above, but did not meet the third criteria. in these cases, carried interest accrues on the consolidated statement of operations, but will not be distributed in cash to us as the general partner of an investment fund upon a realization event. for a fund that has a fair value above cost, overall, but has one or more investments where fair value is below cost, the shortfall between cost and fair value for such investments is referred to as a "netting hole." when netting holes are present, realized gains on individual investments that would otherwise allow the general partner to receive carried interest distributions are instead used to return invested capital to our funds' limited partners in an amount equal to the netting hole. once netting holes have been filled with either (a) return of capital equal to the netting hole for those investments where fair value is below cost, or (b) increases in the fair value of those investments where fair value is below cost, then realized carried interest will be distributed to the general partner upon a realization event. a fund that is in a position to pay cash carry refers to a fund for which carried interest is expected to be paid to the general partner upon the next material realization event, which includes funds with no netting holes as well as funds with a netting hole that is sufficiently small in size such that the next material realization event would be expected to result in the payment of carried interest.
as of december 31, 2014, netting holes existed at certain of our private equity funds, the most significant of which was our european fund ii, overseas 2006 fund and domestic millennium fund, which had netting holes of approximately $373 million, $83 million and $77 million, respectively. in accordance with the criteria set forth above, funds may develop netting holes in the future and netting holes for those and other funds may otherwise increase or decrease in the future. as of december 31, 2014, no private equity funds, other than the european fund ii, overseas 2006 fund and domestic millennium fund, had a netting hole greater than $60 million.

liquidity needs we expect that our primary liquidity needs will consist of cash required to:
 continue to grow our business, including seeding new strategies and funding our capital commitments made to existing and future funds, co-investments and any net capital requirements of our capital markets companies;
 warehouse an investment in a portfolio company or other investment for the benefit of one or more of our funds, accounts or clos pending the contribution of committed capital by the investors in such vehicles;
 service debt obligations, as well as any contingent liabilities that may give rise to future cash payments;
 fund cash operating expenses and amounts recorded for litigation matters;
 pay amounts that may become due under our tax receivable agreement with kkr holdings;
 make cash distributions in accordance with our distribution policy;
 underwrite commitments within our capital markets business;
 fund our equity commitment to joint ventures such as merchant capital solutions llc;
 make future purchase price payments in connection with our proprietary acquisitions, such as our acquisition of prisma and minority interest in certain hedge fund managers, including nephila; and
 acquire additional principal assets, including other investment advisory and broker-dealer businesses.
see "liquiditycontractual obligations, commitments and contingencies on an unconsolidated basis." we believe that the sources of liquidity described above will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months.
capital commitments the agreements governing our active investment funds generally require the general partners of the funds to make minimum capital commitments to such funds, which usually range from 2% to 4% of a fund's total capital commitments at final closing, but may be greater for certain funds pursuing newer strategies. in addition, we are responsible for certain limited partner interests in some of our private equity funds. the following table presents our uncalled commitments to our active investment funds as of december 31, 2014:

as of december 31, 2014, kkr had unfunded commitments consisting of (i) $1,231.3 million, as shown above, to its active private equity and other investment vehicles, (ii) $367.3 million in connection with commitments by kkr's capital markets business, (iii) $128.6 million relating to merchant capital solutions as described below and (iv) other investment commitments of $170.9 million. whether these amounts are actually funded, in whole or in part depends on the terms of such commitments, including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions to funding.
prisma capital partners on october 1, 2012, kkr acquired all of the equity interests of prisma subject to potential purchase price payments in 2014 and 2017. during the year ended december 31, 2014, $123.6 million was paid with approximately $84.1 million settled with the issuance of approximately 3.7 million kkr & co. l.p. common units. kkr may become obligated to make future purchase price payments in 2017 based on whether the prisma business grows to achieve certain operating performance metrics when measured in such year. kkr has the right in its sole discretion to pay a portion of such future purchase price payments, if any, in kkr & co. l.p. common units rather than in cash. see "liquiditycontractual obligations, commitments and contingencies on an unconsolidated basis."
merchant capital solutions merchant capital solutions llc (mcs, formerly known as merchcap solutions llc) is a joint venture partnership with stone point capital and cppib credit investments, inc. mcs seeks to provide capital markets services to mid-market and sponsor-backed companies as well as make certain balance sheet investments to support client needs. kkr and stone point each committed $150 million of equity and cppib committed an additional $50 million to mcs to support its business. kkr's remaining commitment is approximately $128.6 million as of december 31, 2014. kkr expects that certain capital markets activities for third parties (other than kkr and its portfolio companies) will be principally conducted by mcs.
tax receivable agreement we and certain intermediate holding companies that are taxable corporations for u.s. federal, state and local income tax purposes, may be required to acquire kkr group partnership units from time to time pursuant to our exchange agreement with kkr holdings. kkr management holdings l.p. made an election under section 754 of the internal revenue code that will remain in effect for each taxable year in which an exchange of kkr group partnership units for common units occurs, which may result in an increase in our intermediate holding companies' share of the tax basis of the assets of the kkr group partnerships at the time of an exchange of kkr group partnership units. certain of these exchanges are expected to result in an increase in our intermediate holding companies' share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the kkr group partnerships, primarily attributable to a portion of the goodwill inherent in our business that would not otherwise have been available. this increase in tax basis may increase depreciation and amortization deductions for tax purposes and therefore reduce the amount of income tax our intermediate holding companies would otherwise be required to pay in the future. this increase in tax basis may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets.
we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with kkr holdings, which requires our intermediate holding companies to pay to kkr holdings, or to current and former principals who have exchanged kkr holdings units for kkr common units as transferees of kkr group partnership units, 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in u.s. federal, state and local income tax that the intermediate holding companies realize as a result of the increase in tax basis described above, as well as 85% of the amount of any such savings the intermediate holding companies realize as a result of increases in tax basis that arise due to future payments under the agreement. we expect our intermediate holding companies to benefit from the remaining 15% of cash savings, if any, in income tax that they realize. a termination of the agreement or a change of control could give rise to similar payments based on tax savings that we would be deemed to realize in connection with such events. in the event that other of our current or future subsidiaries become taxable as corporations and acquire kkr group partnership units in the future, or if we become taxable as a corporation for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we expect that each will become subject to a tax receivable agreement with substantially similar terms.
these payment obligations are obligations of our intermediate holding companies and not the kkr group partnerships. as such, cash payments received by common unitholders may vary from those received by holders of kkr group partnership units held by kkr holdings and its current and former principals to the extent payments are made to those parties under the tax receivable agreement. payments made under the tax receivable agreement are required to be made within 90 days of the filing of the tax returns of our intermediate holding companies, which may result in a timing difference between the tax savings received by kkr's intermediate holdings companies and the cash payments made to the selling holders of kkr group partnership units.
for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, cash payments that have been made under the tax receivable agreement were $5.7 million, $4.7 million and $2.7 million, respectively. we expect our intermediate holding companies to benefit from the remaining 15% of cash savings, if any, in income tax that they realize. as of december 31, 2014, $2.3 million of cumulative income tax savings have been realized.
distributions our current distribution policy is to make quarterly cash distributions in amounts that in the aggregate are expected to constitute substantially all of the cash earnings of our investment management business, 40% of the net realized investment income of kkr (other than kfn), and 100% of the net realized investment income of kfn, in each case in excess of amounts determined by us to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business, to make appropriate investments in our business and our investment funds and to comply with applicable law and any of our debt instruments or other obligations. for purposes of our distribution policy, our distributions are expected to consist of (i) fre (as defined below), (ii) carry distributions received from our investment funds which have not been allocated as part of our carry pool, (iii) 40% of the net realized investment income from kkr (other than kfn) and (iv) 100% of the net realized investment income from kfn. this amount is expected to be reduced by (i) corporate and applicable local taxes, if any, (ii) segment non-controlling interests, and (iii) amounts determined by us to be necessary or appropriate for the conduct of our business and other matters as discussed above.
the declaration and payment of any distributions are subject to the discretion of the board of directors of the general partner of kkr & co. l.p., which may change the distribution policy at any time, and the terms of its limited partnership agreement. there can be no assurance that distributions will be made as intended or at all or that unitholders will receive sufficient distributions to satisfy payment of their tax liabilities as limited partners of kkr & co. l.p. when kkr & co. l.p. receives distributions from the kkr group partnerships (the holding companies of the kkr business), kkr holdings receives its pro rata share of such distributions from the kkr group partnerships.

total distributable earnings total distributable earnings is the sum of (i) fre, (ii) carry distributions received from kkr's investment funds which have not been allocated as part of its carry pool, (iii) net realized investment incomekkr (ex-kfn) and (iv) net realized investment incomekfn; less (i) applicable local income taxes, if any, and (ii) noncontrolling interests. we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides a supplemental measure to assess performance, excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains (losses), and amounts available for distribution to kkr unitholders. however, total distributable earnings is not a measure that calculates actual distributions under kkr's current distribution policy. see our distribution table above for the actual cash distribution declared for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
total distributable earnings were $2,028.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $573.0 million, compared to $1,455.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in realized cash carry, net of allocation to carry pool of $302.2 million, an increase in net realized investment income of kfn of $150.2 million, which was acquired on april 30, 2014 and an increase in net realized investment income of kkr (ex-kfn) of $94.2 million, partially offset by an increase in cash compensation and benefits of $55.9 million.
total distributable earnings were $1,455.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $6.5 million, compared to $1,449.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in realized cash carry, net of allocation to carry pool of $128.6 million and an increase in fees of $204.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in net realized
investment income of kkr (ex-kfn) of $209.6 million and an increase in cash compensation and benefits of $71.0 million.
distribution per kkr & co. l.p. common unit was $1.90 for the year ended december 31, 2014, an increase of $0.50 per common unit, compared to $1.40 per common unit for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in realized cash carry per common unit of $0.31 and distributable net realized investment incomekfn per common unit of $0.19 as a result of our acquisition of kfn on april 30, 2014. this increase was partially offset by a decrease in after-tax fre primarily due to an increase in adjusted units eligible for distribution primarily as a result of the kfn acquisition on april 30, 2014.
distribution per kkr & co. l.p. common unit was $1.40 for the year ended december 31, 2013, an increase of $0.18 per common unit, compared to $1.22 per common unit for the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in realized cash carry per common unit of $0.17 and an increase in after-tax fre per common unit of $0.10, partially offset by a decrease in distributed net realized investment incomekkr (ex-kfn) per common unit of $0.09.
a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to kkr & co. l.p. on a gaap basis to eni, fre, fee and yield earnings, fee and yield ebitda, total distributable earnings and total ebitda is provided below.
fee related earnings is comprised of (i) total management, monitoring and transaction fees, net, plus incentive fees, less (ii) cash compensation and benefits, occupancy and related charges and other operating expenses. this measure is used by management as an alternative measurement of the operating earnings of kkr and its business segments before carried interest and related carry pool allocations and investment income. we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the operating profitability of our fee generating management companies and capital markets businesses. the components of fre on a segment basis differ from the equivalent gaap amounts on a consolidated basis as a result of: (i) the inclusion of management fees earned from consolidated funds that were eliminated in consolidation; (ii) the exclusion of fees and expenses of certain consolidated entities; (iii) the exclusion of charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets; (iv) the exclusion of charges relating to carry pool allocations; (v) the exclusion of non-cash equity-based charges and other non-cash compensation charges borne by kkr holdings or incurred under the equity incentive plan; (vi) the exclusion of certain reimbursable expenses; and (vii) the exclusion of certain non-recurring items. after tax fre represents fre after deductions for current corporate and local income taxes and non-controlling interests.
net realized investment incomekkr (ex-kfn)
net realized investment incomekkr (ex-kfn) refers to net cash income from (i) realized investment gains and losses excluding certain realized investment losses to the extent unrealized losses on these investments were recognized prior to the combination with kpe on october 1, 2009, (ii) dividend income, and (iii) interest income net of interest expense in each case generated by kkr (excluding kfn). this term describes a portion of kkr's quarterly distribution and excludes net realized investment income of kfn. realized investment losses from balance sheet investments that were already written down as of october 1, 2009 that have been excluded from net realized investment income as described above in (i) above amounted to approximately $56 million and $205 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
net realized investment incomekfn net realized investment incomekfn refers to net cash income from (i) realized investment gains and losses, (ii) dividend income and (iii) interest income net of interest expense less certain general and administrative expenses incurred in the generation of net realized investment income in each case generated by kfn. this term describes a portion of kkr's quarterly distribution.
fee and yield earnings fee and yield earnings is comprised of fre and net interest and dividends from kkr's business segments. this measure is used by management as a measure of the cash earnings of kkr and its business segments' investment income. we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides
insight into the amount of kkr's cash earnings, significant portions of which tend to be more recurring than realized carried interest and net realized gains from quarter to quarter.

other liquidity needs we may also be required to fund various underwriting commitments in our capital markets business in connection with the underwriting of loans, securities or other financial instruments. we generally expect that these commitments will be syndicated to third parties or otherwise fulfilled or terminated, although we may in some instances elect to retain a portion of the commitments for our own investment.
contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies on an unconsolidated basis in the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. the following table sets forth information relating to anticipated future cash payments as of december 31, 2014 on an unconsolidated basis before the consolidation of funds and clos:
uncalled commitments to investment funds(1)       $1,231.3          $              $              $                   $1,231.3

these uncalled commitments represent amounts committed by us to fund a portion of the purchase price paid for each investment made by our investment funds which are actively investing. because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. however, given the size of such commitments and the rates at which our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. see "liquidityliquidity needs."
represents the 2020 senior notes, 2043 senior notes, 2044 senior notes, kfn 2041 senior notes, kfn 2042 senior notes, kfn junior subordinated notes and borrowings outstanding on the kcm credit agreement which are presented gross of unamortized discounts and net of unamortized premiums. kfn's debt obligations are non-recourse to kkr beyond the assets of kfn.
these interest obligations on debt represent estimated interest to be paid over the maturity of the related debt obligation, which has been calculated assuming the debt outstanding at december 31, 2014 is not repaid until its maturity. future interest rates are assumed to be those in effect as of december 31, 2014, including both variable and fixed rates, as applicable, provided for by the relevant debt agreements. the amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness.
represents various commitments in our capital markets business in connection with the underwriting of loans, securities and other financial instruments. these commitments are shown net of amounts syndicated.
represents obligations in our capital markets business to lend under various revolving credit facilities.
represents our commitment to mcs and investment commitments of kfn. see "liquidityliquidity needsmerchant capital solutions."
the commitment table above excludes contractual amounts owed under the tax receivable agreement, because the ultimate amount and timing of the amounts due are not presently known. as of december 31, 2014, a payable of $121.8 million has been recorded in due to affiliates in the consolidated financial statements representing management's best estimate of the amounts currently expected to be owed under the tax receivable agreement. as of december 31, 2014, approximately $13.3 million of cumulative cash payments have been made under the tax receivable agreement. see "liquidity needstax receivable agreement."
the commitment table above excludes certain contingent consideration payments that may be owed in connection with acquisitions and other investments because the ultimate amounts due are not presently known. as of december 31, 2014, the recorded amount of contingent consideration obligations where the amounts are not currently known was approximately $40.6 million.
the commitment table above excludes amounts recorded for litigation matters. see "financial statementsnote 16 "commitments and contingencies."
in the normal course of business, we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations and warranties that provide general indemnifications. in addition, certain of our consolidated funds and kfn have provided certain indemnities relating to environmental and other matters and have provided nonrecourse carve-out guarantees for fraud, willful misconduct and other customary wrongful acts, each in connection with the financing of certain real estate investments that we have made. our maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against us that have not yet occurred. however, based on prior experience, we expect the risk of material loss to be low.
the partnership documents governing our carry-paying funds, including funds and vehicles relating to private equity, mezzanine, infrastructure, energy, direct lending and special situations investments, generally include a "clawback" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation requiring the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to the fund investors at the end of the life of the fund. under a clawback obligation, upon the liquidation of a fund, the general partner is required to return, typically on an after-tax basis, previously distributed carry to the extent that, due to the diminished performance of later investments, the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, including the effects of any performance thresholds. excluding carried interest received by the general partners of funds that were not contributed to us in the kpe transaction, as of december 31, 2014, no carried interest was subject to this clawback obligation, assuming that all applicable carry paying funds were liquidated at their december 31, 2014 fair values. had the investments in such funds been liquidated at zero value, the clawback obligation would have been $2,288.9 million. carried interest is recognized in the statement of operations based on the contractual conditions set forth in the agreements governing the fund as if the fund were terminated and liquidated at the reporting date and the fund's investments were realized at the then estimated fair values. amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. if these investment amounts earned decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and to the extent that the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, a clawback obligation would be recorded. for funds that are consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as an increase in noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of financial condition. for funds that are not consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as a reduction of our investment balance as this is where carried interest is initially recorded.
certain private equity funds that were contributed to us in the kpe transaction in 2009 also include a "net loss sharing provision." upon the liquidation of an investment vehicle to which a net loss sharing obligation applies, the general partner is required to contribute capital to the vehicle, to fund 20% of the net losses on investments. in these vehicles, such losses would be required to be paid by us to the fund investors in those vehicles in the event of a liquidation of the fund regardless of whether any carried interest had previously been distributed, and a greater share of investment losses would be allocable to us relative to the capital that we contributed to it as general partner. based on the fair market values as of december 31, 2014, there would have been no net loss sharing obligation. if the vehicles were liquidated at zero value, the net loss sharing obligation would have been approximately $277.4 million as of december 31, 2014.
prior to the kpe transaction in 2009, certain principals who received carried interest distributions with respect to certain private equity funds contributed to us had personally guaranteed, on a several basis and subject to a cap, the contingent obligations of the general partners of such private equity funds to repay amounts to fund investors pursuant to the general partners' clawback obligations. the terms of the kpe transaction require that principals remain responsible for any clawback obligations relating to carry distributions received prior to the kpe transaction, up to a maximum of $223.6 million. through investment realizations, this amount has been reduced to $191.4 million as of december 31, 2014. using valuations as of december 31, 2014, no amounts are due with respect to the clawback obligation required to be funded by principals. carry distributions arising subsequent to the kpe transaction may give rise to clawback obligations that may be allocated generally to us and to principals who participate in the carry pool. unlike the clawback obligation, we will be responsible for amounts due under a net loss sharing obligation and will indemnify principals for any personal guarantees that they have provided with respect to such amounts. in addition, guarantees of or similar arrangements relating to clawback or net loss sharing obligations in favor of third party investors in an individual investment partnership by entities we own may limit distributions of carried interest more generally.
contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies on a consolidated basis in the ordinary course of business, we and our consolidated funds and clos enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. the following table sets forth information relating to anticipated future cash payments as of december 31, 2014. this table differs from the table presented above which sets forth contractual commitments on an unconsolidated basis principally because this table includes the obligations of our consolidated funds and clos.

these uncalled commitments represent amounts committed by our consolidated investment funds, which include amounts committed by kkr and our fund investors, to fund the purchase price paid for each investment made by our investment funds which are actively investing. because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. however, given the size of such commitments and the rates at which our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. see "liquidityliquidity needs."
amounts include (i) the 2020 senior notes, 2043 senior notes and 2044 senior notes of $1.5 billion gross of unamortized discount, (ii) kfn 2041senior notes and kfn 2042 senior notes of $0.4 billion, net of unamortized premium, (iii) kfn junior subordinated notes of $0.3 billion, gross of unamortized discount, (iv) financing arrangements entered into by our consolidated funds with the objective of enhancing returns or providing liquidity to the funds of $1.0 billion and
(v) debt securities issued by our consolidated clos of $7.8 billion. kfn's debt obligations are non-recourse to kkr beyond the assets of kfn. debt securities issued by consolidated clos are supported solely by the investments held at the clo vehicles and are not collateralized by assets of any other kkr entity. obligations under financing arrangements entered into by our consolidated funds are generally limited to our pro-rata equity interest in such funds. our management companies bear no obligations to repay any financing arrangements at our consolidated funds.
these interest obligations on debt represent estimated interest to be paid over the maturity of the related debt obligation, which has been calculated assuming the debt outstanding at december 31, 2014 is not repaid until its maturity. future interest rates are assumed to be those in effect as of december 31, 2014, including both variable and fixed rates, as applicable, provided for by the relevant debt agreements. the amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness.
represents various commitments in our capital markets business in connection with the underwriting of loans, securities and other financial instruments. these commitments are shown net of amounts syndicated.
represents obligations in our capital markets business to lend under various revolving credit facilities.
represents our commitment to mcs and investment commitments of kfn. see "liquidityliquidity needsmerchant capital solutions."
the commitment table above excludes contractual amounts owed under the tax receivable agreement because the ultimate amount and timing of the amounts due are not presently known. as of december 31, 2014, a payable of $121.8 million has been recorded in due to affiliates in the consolidated financial statements representing management's best estimate of the amounts currently expected to be owed under the tax receivable agreement. as of december 31, 2014, approximately $13.3 million of cumulative cash payments have been made under the tax receivable agreement. see "liquidity needstax receivable agreement."
the commitment table above excludes certain contingent consideration payments that may be owed in connection with acquisitions and other investments because the ultimate amounts due are not presently known. as of december 31, 2014, the recorded amount of contingent consideration obligations where the amounts are not currently known was approximately $40.6 million.
the commitment table above excludes amounts recorded for litigation matters. see "financial statementsnote 16 "commitments and contingencies."
off balance sheet arrangements other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities.
consolidated statement of cash flows the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of our consolidated entities which, in particular, include our consolidated funds and clos notwithstanding the fact that we may hold only a minority economic interest in those funds and clos. the assets of our consolidated funds and clos, on a gross basis, are substantially larger than the assets of our business and, accordingly, have a substantial effect on the cash flows reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows. the primary cash flow activities of our consolidated funds and clos involve: (i) capital contributions from fund investors; (ii) using the capital of fund investors to make investments;
(iii) financing certain investments with indebtedness; (iv) generating cash flows through the realization of investments; and (v) distributing cash flows from the realization of investments to fund investors. because our consolidated funds and clos are treated as investment companies for accounting purposes, certain of these cash flow amounts are included in our cash flows from operations.
net cash provided by (used in) operating activities our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $1.5 billion, $2.6 billion and $6.2 billion during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. these amounts primarily included: (i) proceeds from sales of investments and principal payments net of purchases of investments by our funds and clos of $1.0 billion, $1.4 billion and $5.1 billion during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively; (ii) net realized gains (losses) on investments of $5.4 billion, $3.9 billion and $5.2 billion during the year ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively; and (iii) change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments of $(0.7) billion, $3.9 billion and $2.7 billion during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. certain kkr funds and clos are, for gaap purposes, investment companies and reflect their investments and other financial instruments at fair value.
net cash provided by (used in) investing activities our net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(22.9) million, $15.5 million and $(220.9) million during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. our investing activities included the purchases of furniture, computer hardware and leasehold improvements of $12.2 million, $14.4 million and $37.0 million, change in restricted cash and cash equivalents (that primarily funds collateral requirements) of $(10.8) million, $(29.9) million and $(2.9) million during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively proceeds from sales of oil and natural gas properties, net of development of oil and natural gas properties of $(151.4) million for the year ended december 31, 2014 as well as cash acquired, net of cash paid for acquisitions of $151.5 million and $(186.9) million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2012.
net cash provided by (used in) financing activities our net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(1.9) billion, $(2.5) billion and $(5.6) billion during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. our financing activities primarily included: (i) distributions to, net of contributions by our noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests, of $(2.7) billion, $(2.8) billion and $(4.9) billion during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively; (ii) proceeds received net of repayment of debt obligations of $1.7 billion, $0.8 billion and $(0.4) billion during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively; and (iii) distributions to our partners of $(0.8) billion, $(0.4) billion and $(0.2) billion during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of fees, expenses and investment income. our management bases these estimates and judgments on available information, historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. however, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are often subjective and may be impacted negatively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. if actual amounts are ultimately different from those estimated, judged or assumed, revisions are included in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which the actual amounts become known. we believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying estimates,
judgments or assumptions. please see the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further detail regarding our critical accounting policies.
principles of consolidation the types of entities with which kkr is involved generally include (i) subsidiaries, including management companies, broker-dealers and general partners of investment funds that kkr manages, (ii) entities that have all the attributes of an investment company like investment funds, (iii) clos and (iv) other entities, including entities that employ non-employee operating consultants. each of these entities is assessed for consolidation on a case by case basis depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding that entity.
pursuant to its consolidation policy, kkr first considers whether an entity is considered a variable interest entity ("vie") and therefore whether to apply the consolidation guidance under the vie model. entities that do not qualify as vies are generally assessed for consolidation as voting interest entities ("voes") under the voting interest model.
the consolidation rules were revised effective january 1, 2010 which had the effect of changing the criteria for determining whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a vie. however, the adoption of these new consolidation rules was indefinitely deferred (the "deferral") for a reporting entity's interests in certain entities. in particular, entities that have all the attributes of an investment company such as investment funds generally meet the conditions necessary for the deferral. entities that are securitization or asset-backed financing entities such as clos would generally not qualify for the deferral. accordingly, when making the assessment of whether an entity is a vie, kkr considers whether the entity being assessed meets the conditions for the deferral and therefore would be subject to the rules that existed prior to january 1, 2010. under both sets of rules, vies for which kkr is determined to be the primary beneficiary are consolidated and such vies generally include certain clo vehicles and entities that employ non-employee operating consultants.
with respect to kkr's consolidated funds that are not clos, kkr meets the criteria for the deferral and therefore applies the consolidation rules that existed prior to january 1, 2010. for these funds, kkr generally has operational discretion and control, and fund investors have no substantive rights to impact ongoing governance and operating activities of the fund, including the ability to remove the general partner, also known as kick-out rights. as a result, a fund should be consolidated unless kkr has a nominal level of equity at risk. to the extent that kkr commits a nominal amount of equity to a given fund and has no obligation to fund any future losses, the equity at risk to kkr is not considered substantive and the fund is typically considered a vie. in these cases, the fund investors are generally deemed to be the primary beneficiaries, and kkr does not consolidate the fund. in cases when kkr's equity at risk is deemed to be substantive, the fund is generally considered to be a voe and kkr generally consolidates the fund under the voe model.
with respect to clos, which are generally vies, the criteria for the deferral are not met and therefore kkr applies the consolidation rules issued on january 1, 2010. in its role as collateral manager, kkr generally has the power to direct the activities of the clo entities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity. in some, but not all cases, kkr, through both its residual interest in the clo and the potential to earn an incentive fee, may have variable interests that represent an obligation to absorb losses of or a right to receive benefits from the clo that could potentially be significant to kkr. in cases where kkr has both (a) the power to direct the activities of the clo that most significantly impact the clos economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the clo or the right to receive benefits from the clo that could potentially be significant to the clo, kkr consolidates the clo.
certain of kkr's funds and clos are consolidated by kkr notwithstanding the fact that kkr has only a minority economic interest in those funds and vehicles. kkr's financial statements reflect
the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses, investment income (loss) and cash flows of the consolidated kkr funds and vehicles on a gross basis, and the majority of the economic interests in those funds, which are held by fund investors or other stakeholders, are attributed to noncontrolling interests or appropriated capital in the accompanying financial statements. all of the management fees and certain other amounts earned by kkr from those funds and entities are eliminated in consolidation. however, because the eliminated amounts are earned from, and funded by, noncontrolling interests, kkr's attributable share of the net income (loss) from those funds is increased by the amounts eliminated. accordingly, the elimination in consolidation of such amounts has no effect on net income (loss) attributable to kkr or kkr partners' capital.
kkr's funds are, for gaap purposes, investment companies and therefore are not required to consolidate their investments, including investments in portfolio companies, even if majority-owned and controlled. rather, the consolidated funds and vehicles reflect their investments at fair value as described below in "fair value measurements". all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
investments investments consist primarily of private equity, real assets, credit, investments of consolidated clos, equity method and other investments. investments are carried at their estimated fair values, with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as a component of net gains (losses) from investment activities in the consolidated statements of operations. investments denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar are valued based on the spot rate of the respective currency at the end of the reporting period with changes related to exchange rate movements reflected as a component of net gains (losses) from investment activities in the consolidated statements of operations. security and loan transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. further disclosure on investments is presented in note 4, "investments."
the following describes the types of securities held within each investment class.
private equityconsists primarily of equity investments in operating businesses.
real assetsconsists primarily of investments in (i) energy related assets, principally oil and natural gas producing properties, (ii) infrastructure assets, and (iii) real estate, principally residential and commercial real estate assets and businesses.
creditconsists primarily of investments in below investment grade corporate debt (primarily high yield bonds and syndicated bank loans), distressed and opportunistic debt and interests in unconsolidated clos.
investments of consolidated closconsists primarily of investments in below investment grade corporate debt securities (primarily high yield bonds and syndicated bank loans) held directly by the consolidated clo vehicles.
equity methodconsists primarily of investments in which kkr has significant influence, including investments in unconsolidated investment funds.
otherconsists primarily of investments in common stock, preferred stock, warrants and options of companies that are not private equity, real assets, credit or equity method investments.
fair value measurements investments and other financial instruments are measured and carried at fair value. the majority of investments and other financial instruments are held by the consolidated funds and vehicles. kkr's funds are, for gaap purposes, investment companies and reflect their investments and other financial
instruments at fair value. kkr has retained the specialized accounting for the consolidated funds and vehicles in consolidation. accordingly, the unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of the investments held by kkr's funds are reflected as a component of net gains (losses) from investment activities in the consolidated statements of operations.
for investments and other financial instruments that are not held in a consolidated fund or vehicle, kkr has elected the fair value option since these investments and other financial instruments are similar to those in the consolidated funds and vehicles. such election is irrevocable and is applied on an investment by investment basis at initial recognition. unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are reflected as a component of net gains (losses) from investment activities in the consolidated statements of operations. the methodology for measuring the fair value of such investments and other financial instruments is consistent with the methodologies applied to investments and other financial instruments that are held in consolidated funds and vehicles. in addition, kkr has elected the fair value option for the investments and debt obligations of the consolidated clo vehicles.
the carrying amounts of other assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities recognized on the consolidated statements of financial condition (excluding fixed assets, goodwill, intangible assets, contingent consideration and certain debt obligations) approximate fair value due to their short term maturities. further information on fixed assets is presented in note 7, "other assets and accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities". further information on goodwill and intangible assets is presented in note 15 "goodwill and intangible assets." further information on contingent consideration is presented in note 14 "acquisitions." kkr's debt obligations, except for kkr's 2020, 2043 and 2044 senior notes and kfn's 2041 and 2042 senior notes and certain junior subordinated notes, bear interest at floating rates and therefore fair value approximates carrying value. further information on kkr's 2020, 2043 and 2044 senior notes and kfn's 2041 and 2042 senior notes and certain junior subordinated notes are presented in note 9, "debt obligations". the fair values for kkr's 2020, 2043 and 2044 senior notes were derived using level ii inputs similar to those utilized in valuing credit investments. the fair values for kfn's 2041 and 2042 senior notes were derived using level i inputs. the fair values for certain junior subordinated notes were derived using level iii inputs similar to those utilized in valuing credit investments.
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation techniques are applied. these valuation techniques involve varying levels of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on a variety of factors. see note 5, "fair value measurements" for further information on kkr's valuation techniques that involve unobservable inputs. assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the statements of financial condition are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. hierarchical levels, as defined under gaap, are directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to the valuation of these assets and liabilities. the hierarchical levels defined under gaap are as follows:
level i inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. the type of investments and other financial instruments included in this category are publicly-listed equities and debt and securities sold short. we classified 10.9% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as level i at december 31, 2014.
level ii inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. level ii inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. the type of investments and other financial instruments included in this category are credit investments, convertible debt securities indexed to publicly-listed securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives. we classified 29.0% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as level ii at december 31, 2014.
level iii inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. the types of assets and liabilities generally included in this category are private portfolio companies, real assets investments and credit investments for which a sufficiently liquid trading market does not exist. we classified 60.1% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as level iii at december 31, 2014. the valuation of our level iii investments at december 31, 2014 represents management's best estimate of the amounts that we would anticipate realizing on the sale of these investments at such date.
in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. in such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the asset.
a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability is an indication that transactions or quoted prices may not be representative of fair value because in such market conditions there may be increased instances of transactions that are not orderly. in those circumstances, further analysis of transactions or quoted prices is needed, and a significant adjustment to the transactions or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value.
the availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial asset or liability and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of instrument, whether the instrument has recently been issued, whether the instrument is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market, and current market conditions. to the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by us in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level iii. the variability and availability of the observable inputs affected by the factors described above may cause transfers between levels i, ii, and iii, which we recognize at the beginning of the reporting period.
investments and other financial instruments that have readily observable market prices (such as those traded on a securities exchange) are stated at the last quoted sales price as of the reporting date. we do not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where we hold a large position and a sale could reasonably affect the quoted price.
level ii valuation methodologies financial assets and liabilities categorized as level ii consist primarily of securities indexed to publicly-listed securities and credit and other investments. credit investments generally have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. bid prices reflect the highest price that kkr and others are willing to pay for an asset. ask prices represent the lowest price that kkr and others are willing to accept for an asset. for financial assets and liabilities whose inputs are based on bid-ask
prices obtained from third party pricing services, fair value may not always be a predetermined point in the bid-ask range. our policy is generally to allow for mid-market pricing and adjusting to the point within the bid-ask range that meets our best estimate of fair value. for securities indexed to publicly listed securities, such as convertible debt, the securities are typically valued using standard convertible security pricing models. the key inputs into these models that require some amount of judgment are the credit spreads utilized and the volatility assumed. to the extent the company being valued has other outstanding debt securities that are publicly-traded, the implied credit spread on the company's other outstanding debt securities would be utilized in the valuation. to the extent the company being valued does not have other outstanding debt securities that are publicly-traded, the credit spread will be estimated based on the implied credit spreads observed in comparable publicly-traded debt securities. in certain cases, an additional spread will be added to reflect an illiquidity discount due to the fact that the security being valued is not publicly-traded. the volatility assumption is based upon the historically observed volatility of the underlying equity security into which the convertible debt security is convertible and/or the volatility implied by the prices of options on the underlying equity security.
level iii valuation methodologies management's determination of fair value is based upon the best information available for a given circumstance and may incorporate assumptions that are management's best estimates after consideration of a variety of internal and external factors.
financial assets and liabilities categorized as level iii consist primarily of the following:
private equity investments:    we generally employ two valuation methodologies when determining the fair value of a private equity investment. the first methodology is typically a market comparables analysis that considers key financial inputs and recent public and private transactions and other available measures. the second methodology utilized is typically a discounted cash flow analysis, which incorporates significant assumptions and judgments. estimates of key inputs used in this methodology include the weighted average cost of capital for the investment and assumed inputs used to calculate terminal values, such as exit ebitda multiples. other inputs are also used in both methodologies. for valuations determined for periods other than at year end, various inputs may be estimated prior to the end of the relevant period. also, as discussed in greater detail under "business environment" and "risk factorsrisks related to the assets we manageour investments are impacted by various economic conditions that are difficult to quantify or predict, but may have a significant adverse impact on the value of our investments," a change in interest rates could have a significant impact on valuations. in certain cases the results of the discounted cash flow approach can be significantly impacted by these estimates. in addition, when a definitive agreement has been executed to sell an investment, kkr generally considers a significant determinant of fair value to be the consideration to be received by kkr pursuant to the executed definitive agreement.
upon completion of the valuations conducted using these methodologies, a weighting is ascribed to each method, and an illiquidity discount is typically applied where appropriate. the ultimate fair value recorded for a particular investment will generally be within a range suggested by the two methodologies, except that the value may be higher or lower than such range in the case of investments being sold pursuant to an executed definitive agreement.
when determining the weighting ascribed to each valuation methodology, we consider, among other factors, the availability of direct market comparables, the applicability of a discounted cash flow analysis, the expected hold period and manner of realization for the investment, and in the case of investments being sold pursuant to an executed definitive agreement, the probability of such sale being completed. these factors can result in different weightings among investments in the portfolio and in certain instances may result in up to a 100% weighting to a single methodology. across the level iii private equity investment portfolio, approximately 58.3% of the fair value is derived from investments
that are valued based exactly 50% on market comparables and 50% on a discounted cash flow analysis. less than 5% of the fair value of the level iii private equity investment portfolio is derived from investments that are valued either based 100% on market comparables or 100% on a discounted cash flow analysis. as of december 31, 2014, the overall weights ascribed to the market comparables methodology, the discounted cash flow methodology and a methodology based on pending sales for our level iii private equity investments were 40% and 40% and 20%, respectively. as of december 31, 2014, we believe that the approach of using the market multiples methodology, the discounted cash flow methodology and valuations based on pending sales resulted in valuations of our aggregate level iii private equity portfolio that were only 2.7% higher than if only the discounted cash flow methodology had been used and only 1.0% lower than if only the market comparables methodology had been used.
when an illiquidity discount is to be applied, we seek to take a uniform approach across our portfolio and generally apply a minimum 5% discount to all private equity investments. we then evaluate such private equity investments to determine if factors exist that could make it more challenging to monetize the investment and, therefore, justify applying a higher illiquidity discount. these factors generally include (i) whether we are unable to freely sell the portfolio company or conduct an initial public offering of the portfolio company due to the consent rights of a third party or similar factors, (ii) whether the portfolio company is undergoing significant restructuring activity or similar factors and (iii) characteristics about the portfolio company regarding its size and/or whether the portfolio company is experiencing, or expected to experience, a significant decline in earnings. these factors generally make it less likely that a portfolio company would be sold or publicly offered in the near term at a price indicated by using just a market multiples and/or discounted cash flow analysis, and these factors tend to reduce the number of opportunities to sell an investment and/or increase the time horizon over which an investment may be monetized. depending on the applicability of these factors, we determine the amount of any incremental illiquidity discount to be applied above the 5% minimum, and during the time we hold the investment, the illiquidity discount may be increased or decreased, from time to time, based on changes to these factors. the amount of illiquidity discount applied at any time requires considerable judgment about what a market participant would consider and is based on the facts and circumstances of each individual investment. accordingly, the illiquidity discount ultimately considered by a market participant upon the realization of any investment may be higher or lower than that estimated by us in our valuations.
real assets investments:    real asset investments in infrastructure, energy and real estate are valued using one or more of the discounted cash flow analysis, market comparables analysis and direct income capitalization, which in each case incorporates significant assumptions and judgments. infrastructure investments are generally valued using the discounted cash flow analysis. key inputs used in this methodology include the weighted average cost of capital and assumed inputs used to calculate terminal values, such as exit ebitda multiples. energy investments are generally valued using a discounted cash flow analysis. key inputs used in this methodology that require estimates include commodity price forecasts and the weighted average cost of capital. certain energy investments do not include a minimum illiquidity discount. in addition, the valuations of energy investments generally incorporate both commodity prices as quoted on indices and long-term commodity price forecasts, which may be substantially different from, and are currently higher than, commodity prices on certain indices for equivalent future dates. long-term commodity price forecasts are utilized to capture the value of the investments across a range of commodity prices within the energy investment portfolio associated with future development and to reflect price expectations that are estimated to be required to balance demand and production in global commodity markets over the long-term. real estate investments are generally valued using a combination of direct income capitalization and discounted cash flow analysis. key inputs used in such methodologies that require estimates include an unlevered discount rate and current capitalization rate, and certain real estate investments do not include a minimum illiquidity discount. the valuations of real assets investments also use other inputs.
during the quarter ended december 31, 2014, the value of our energy real asset investments in oil and gas producing properties decreased meaningfully. this decrease in value was primarily attributable to a drop in long-term oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices during the year ended december 31, 2014 with the greatest declines occurring in the fourth quarter. the 2017 price of wti crude oil declined from approximately $85 per barrel to $67 per barrel and the 2017 price of natural gas declined from approximately $4.22 per mcf to $3.76 per mcf as of september 30, 2014 and december 31, 2014, respectively.
on a segment basis, our energy real asset investments in oil and gas producing properties as of december 31, 2014 had a fair value of approximately $695 million. based on this fair value, we estimate that an immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of these energy investments from one or more adverse movements to the investments' valuation inputs would result in a decline in investment income of $69.5 million and a decline in net income attributable to kkr & co. l.p. of $37.2 million, after deducting amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests held by kkr holdings l.p. as of december 31, 2014, if we were to value our energy investments using only the commodity prices as quoted on indices and did not use long-term commodity price forecasts and also held all other inputs to their valuation constant, we estimate that investment income would have been approximately $115 million lower for the year ended december 31, 2014, resulting in a lower amount of net income attributable to kkr & co. l.p. of 53.5% of the overall decrease in investment income, after deducting amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests held by kkr holdings l.p.
these hypothetical declines relate only to investment income. there would be no current impact on kkr's carried interest since all of the investment funds which hold these types of energy investments have investment values that are below their cost and as such are not currently accruing carried interest. additionally, there would be no impact on fees since fees earned from investment funds which hold investments in oil and gas producing properties are based on either committed capital or capital invested.
for gaap purposes, where kkr holds energy investments consisting of working interests in oil and gas producing properties directly and not through an investment fund, such working interests are consolidated based on the proportion of the working interests held by us. accordingly, we reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, investment income and cash flows of the consolidated working interests on a gross basis and changes in the value of these energy investments are not reflected as unrealized gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations. accordingly, a change in fair value for these investments does not result in a decrease in net gains (losses) from investment activities. however, management believes that a decrease in investment income associated with these energy investments of the magnitude described above would have resulted in an impairment charge reflected in general, administrative and other expenses in an amount not dissimilar to the decline in investment income associated with the energy real asset investments on a segment basis as described above. for segment purposes, these directly held working interests are treated as investments and changes in value are reflected in our segment results as unrealized gains and losses.
credit investments:    credit investments are valued using values obtained from dealers or market makers, and where these values are not available, credit investments are valued by us based on ranges of values determined by an independent valuation firm. valuation models are based on discounted cash flow analyses, for which the key inputs are determined based on market comparables, which incorporate similar instruments from similar issuers.
other investments:    we generally employ the same valuation methodologies as described above for private equity investments when valuing these other investments.
clo debt obligations:    collateralized loan obligation secured notes are initially valued at transaction price and are subsequently valued using a third party valuation service. the most significant inputs to the valuation of these instruments are default and loss expectations and discount margins.
key unobservable inputs that have a significant impact on our level iii investment valuations as described above are included in note 5 "fair value measurements" of the financial statements included elsewhere in this report. we utilize several unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions in determining the fair value of our level iii investments. these unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions may differ by investment and in the application of our valuation methodologies. our reported fair value estimates could vary materially if we had chosen to incorporate different unobservable pricing inputs and other assumptions or, for applicable investments, if we only used either the discounted cash flow methodology or the market comparables methodology instead of assigning a weighting to both methodologies.
level iii valuation process the valuation process involved for level iii measurements is completed on a quarterly basis and is designed to subject the valuation of level iii investments to an appropriate level of consistency, oversight, and review. we have a private markets valuation committee for private equity and real assets investments and a valuation committee for credit (including investments held by consolidated clos) and other investments. the private markets valuation committee may be assisted by subcommittees for example in the valuation of real estate investments. each of the private markets valuation committee and the credit valuation committee is assisted by a valuation team, which, except as noted below, is comprised only of employees who are not investment professionals responsible for preparing preliminary valuations or for oversight of the investments being valued. the valuation teams for energy, infrastructure and real estate investments include investment professionals who participate in the preparation of preliminary valuations and oversight for those investments. the valuation committees and teams are responsible for coordinating and consistently implementing our quarterly valuation policies, guidelines and processes. for private markets investments classified as level iii, investment professionals prepare preliminary valuations based on their evaluation of financial and operating data, company specific developments, market valuations of comparable companies and other factors. these preliminary valuations are reviewed with the investment professionals by the applicable valuation team and are also reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by us to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of our valuations annually for all level iii investments in private markets and quarterly for investments other than investments which fall below pre-set value thresholds and which in the aggregate have comprised a de minimis percentage of the total value of our level iii private markets investments. for most investments classified as level iii in credit, in general, an independent valuation firm is engaged by us to provide third party valuations, or ranges of valuations from which our investment professionals select a preliminary valuation, or an independent valuation firm is engaged by us to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of our valuations. credit investments, which in the aggregate amount to approximately 7% of the total value of our level iii credit investments, are not valued with the engagement of an independent valuation firm. all preliminary valuations in private markets and credit are then reviewed by the applicable valuation committee, and after reflecting any input by their respective valuation committees, the preliminary valuations are presented to the firm's management committee. when these valuations are approved by this committee after reflecting any input from it, the valuations of level iii investments, as well as the valuations of level i and level ii investments, are presented to the audit committee of our board of directors and are then reported on to the board of directors.
as of december 31, 2014, upon completion by, where applicable, an independent valuation firm of certain limited procedures requested to be performed by them, the independent valuation firm concluded that the fair values, as determined by kkr, of private markets investments reviewed by
them were reasonable. the limited procedures did not involve an audit, review, compilation or any other form of examination or attestation under generally accepted auditing standards and were not conducted on all level iii investments. we are responsible for determining the fair value of investments in good faith, and the limited procedures performed by an independent valuation firm are supplementary to the inquiries and procedures that we are required to undertake to determine the fair value of the commensurate investments.
as described above, level ii and level iii investments were valued using internal models with significant unobservable inputs and our determinations of the fair values of these investments may differ materially from the values that would have resulted if readily observable inputs had existed. additional external factors may cause those values, and the values of investments for which readily observable inputs exist, to increase or decrease over time, which may create volatility in our earnings and the amounts of assets and partners' capital that we report from time to time.
changes in the fair value of the investments of our consolidated private equity funds may impact the net gains (losses) from investment activities of our private equity funds as described under "key financial measuresinvestment income (loss)net gains (losses) from investment activities." based on the investments of our private equity funds as of december 31, 2014, we estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of the funds' investments generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains (losses) from investment activities (except that carried interest would likely be more significantly impacted), regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. the impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to kkr would generally be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a majority of the change in fair value would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our balance sheet investments.
as of december 31, 2014, investments which represented greater than 5% of consolidated investments consisted of walgreens boots alliance inc. (the company resulting from walgreen's acquisition of alliance boots gmbh) and first data corporation valued at $5.5 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. on a segment basis, as of december 31, 2014, investments which represented greater than 5% of total reportable segments investments consisted of first data corporation and walgreens boots alliance inc. valued at $1,123.5 million and $738.3 million, respectively.
revenue recognition fees consist primarily of (i) transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital markets activities, (ii) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, clos and other vehicles and separately managed accounts, (iii) monitoring fees from providing services to portfolio companies, (iv) revenue earned by oil and gas-producing entities that are consolidated and (v) consulting fees earned by entities that employ non-employee operating consultants. these fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned, which coincides with the period during which the related services are performed and in the case of transaction fees, upon closing of the transaction. monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control. these termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes.
recognition of investment income investment income consists primarily of the net impact of: (i) realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments, (ii) dividends, (iii) interest income, (iv) interest expense and (v) foreign exchange gains and losses relating to mark-to-market activity on foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency options, foreign denominated debt and debt securities issued by consolidated clos.
unrealized gains or losses resulting from the aforementioned activities are included in net gains (losses) from investment activities. upon disposition of an instrument that is marked-to-market, previously recognized unrealized gains or losses are reversed and a realized gain or loss is recognized. while this reversal generally does not significantly impact the net amounts of gains (losses) that we recognize from investment activities, it affects the manner in which we classify our gains and losses for reporting purposes.
due to the consolidation of the majority of our funds, the portion of our funds' investment income that is allocable to our carried interests and capital investments is not shown in the consolidated financial statements. for funds that are consolidated, all investment income (loss), including the portion of a funds' investment income (loss) that is allocable to kkr's carried interest, is included in investment income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. the carried interest that kkr retains in net income (loss) attributable to kkr & co. l.p. is reflected as an adjustment to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. because the substantial majority of our funds are consolidated and because we hold only a minority economic interest in our funds' investments, our share of the investment income generated by our funds' investment activities is significantly less than the total amount of investment income presented in the consolidated financial statements.
recognition of carried interest in the statement of operations carried interest entitles the general partner of a fund to a greater allocable share of the fund's earnings from investments relative to the capital contributed by the general partner and correspondingly reduces noncontrolling interests' attributable share of those earnings. amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are included as investment income (loss) in net gains (losses) from investment activities and are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. if these investment returns decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and reflected as investment losses in net gains (losses) from investment activities.
carried interest is recognized in the statement of operations based on the contractual conditions set forth in the agreements governing the fund as if the fund were terminated and liquidated at the reporting date and the fund's investments were realized at the then estimated fair values. due to the extended durations of our private equity funds, we believe that this approach results in income recognition that best reflects our periodic performance in the management of those funds. amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. if these investment amounts earned decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and to the extent that the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, a clawback obligation would be recorded. for funds that are consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as an increase in noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of financial condition. for funds that are not consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as a reduction of our investment balance as this is where carried interest is initially recorded.
clawback provision the partnership documents governing our carry-paying funds, including funds relating to private equity, mezzanine, infrastructure, energy, real estate, direct lending and special situations investments, generally include a "clawback" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation requiring the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to the fund investors at the end of the life of the fund. under a clawback obligation, upon the liquidation of a carry-paying fund, the general partner is required to return, typically on an after-tax basis, previously distributed carry to
the extent that, due to the diminished performance of later investments, the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled including the effects of any performance hurdle.
prior to the kpe transaction, certain principals who received carried interest distributions with respect to certain private equity funds contributed to kkr had personally guaranteed, on a several basis and subject to a cap, the contingent obligations of the general partners of such private equity funds to repay amounts to fund investors pursuant to the general partners' clawback obligations. the terms of the kpe transaction require that principals remain responsible for any clawback obligations relating to carry distributions received prior to the kpe transaction, up to a maximum of $223.6 million. through investment realizations, this amount has been reduced to $191.4 million as of december 31, 2014. carry distributions arising subsequent to the kpe transaction may give rise to clawback obligations that may be allocated generally to kkr and principals who participate in the carry pool.
net loss sharing provision certain private equity funds that were contributed to kkr in the kpe transaction also include a "net loss sharing provision." upon the liquidation of an investment vehicle to which a net loss sharing obligation applies, the general partner is required to contribute capital to the vehicle, to fund 20% of the net losses on investments. in these vehicles, such losses would be required to be paid by kkr to fund investors in those vehicles in the event of a liquidation of the fund regardless of whether any carried interest had previously been distributed, and a greater share of investment losses would be allocable to us relative to the capital that we contributed to it as general partner. unlike the clawback obligation, kkr will be responsible for all amounts due under a net loss sharing obligation and will indemnify principals for any personal guarantees that they have provided with respect to such amounts.
recently issued accounting pronouncements foreign currency matters in march 2013, the fasb issued asu 2013-05, "foreign currency matters," which indicates that the entire amount of a cumulative translation adjustment ("cta") related to an entity's investment in a foreign entity should be released when there has been a (i) sale of a subsidiary or group of net assets within a foreign entity and the sale represents the substantially complete liquidation of the investment in the foreign entity, (ii) loss of a controlling financial interest in an investment in a foreign entity, or (iii) step acquisition for a foreign entity. this guidance was effective as of january 1, 2014. the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on kkr's financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2014.
amendments to investment company scope, measurement, and disclosures in june 2013, the fasb issued asu 2013-08, financial servicesinvestment companies topic 946 ("asu 2013-08") which amends the scope, measurement, and disclosure requirements for investment companies. asu 2013-08 (i) amends the criteria for an entity to qualify as an investment company, (ii) requires an investment company to measure noncontrolling ownership interests in other investment companies at fair value rather than using the equity method of accounting, and (iii) introduces new disclosures. this guidance was effective as of january 1, 2014. the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on kkr's financial statements.
revenue from contracts with customers in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 ("asu 2014-09") which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for
revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. revenue recorded under asu 2014-09 will depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. this guidance is effective for kkr's fiscal year beginning january 1, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. kkr is in the process of assessing the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on its financial statements, including with respect to the timing of the recognition of carried interest.
measurement of financial assets and liabilitiesconsolidated collateralized financing entities in august 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-13, "measuring the financial assets and financial liabilities of a consolidated collateralized financing entity" ("cfe"), such as clos. this standard provides that an entity with an election to measure the financial assets and financial liabilities of a consolidated cfe should be measured on the basis of either the fair value of the cfe's financial assets or financial liabilities, whichever is more observable. the effective date of the consensus will be for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2015 for public companies and early adoption will be permitted. kkr is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements.
going concern in august 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-15, presentation of financial statementsgoing concern (subtopic 205-40) disclosure of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern ("asu 2014-15"). the guidance in asu 2014-15 sets forth management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern as well as required disclosures. asu 2014-15 indicates that, when preparing interim and annual financial statements, management should evaluate whether conditions or events, in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. this evaluation should include consideration of conditions and events that are either known or are reasonably knowable at the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued, as well as whether it is probable that management's plans to address the substantial doubt will be implemented and, if so, whether it is probable that the plans will alleviate the substantial doubt. asu 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after december 15, 2016, and interim periods and annual periods thereafter. early adoption is permitted. the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on kkr's financial statements.
derivatives and hedging in november 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-16, derivatives and hedging (topic 815): determining whether the host contract in a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share is more akin to debt or to equity ("asu 2014-16"). the guidance in asu 2014-16 states that implied substantive terms and features of a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a stock should weigh each term and feature on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances. an entity should determine the nature of the host contract by considering the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument, including the embedded derivative feature that is being evaluated for separate accounting from the host contract. asu 2014-16 is effective for reporting periods starting after december 15, 2015 and for interim periods within the fiscal year. early adoption is permitted. the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on kkr's financial statements.
consolidation in february 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-02, consolidation (topic 810): amendments to the consolidation analysis ("asu 2015-02"). the guidance in asu 2015-02 eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and also eliminates the consolidation model specific to limited partnerships. the amendments also clarify how to treat fees paid to an asset manager or other entity that makes the decisions for the investment vehicle and whether they should be considered in determining when a variable interest entity should be reported on an asset manager's balance sheet. asu 2015-02 is effective for reporting periods starting after december 15, 2015 and for interim periods within the fiscal year. early adoption is permitted. kkr is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements but expects to deconsolidate certain investment funds, vehicles and entities upon adoption of this guidance.
item 7a.    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risks primarily relates to movements in the fair value of investments, including the effect that those movements have on our management fees, carried interest and net gains from investment activities. the fair value of investments may fluctuate in response to changes in the values of investments, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. additionally, interest rate movements can adversely impact the amount of interest income we receive on credit instruments bearing variable rates and could also impact the amount of interest that we pay on debt obligations bearing variable rates.
the quantitative information provided in this section was prepared using estimates and assumptions that management believes are appropriate in order to provide a reader with an indication of the directional impact that a hypothetical adverse movement in certain risks would have on net income attributable to kkr & co. l.p. in all cases, these directional impacts are presented after deducting amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests held by kkr holdings l.p. as of december 31, 2014, kkr & co. l.p. and kkr holdings l.p. held interests in our business of 53.5% and 46.5%, respectively. the actual impact of a hypothetical adverse movement in these risks could be materially different from the amounts shown below.
the firm uses various committees to help manage market risk and general business risks.
management of market risk when we commit capital of a certain amount from our balance sheet to investments or transactions, a balance sheet committee of senior employees, including our two co-chief executive officers, the chief financial officer and chief administrative officer, must approve the investment or transaction before it may be made. the committee may delegate authority to other employees subject to maximum commitment sizes or other limitations determined by the committee. in addition, this committee supervises activities governing kkr's capital structure, liquidity, and the composition of our balance sheet.
certain securities transactions by our capital markets business are subject to risk tolerance limits, regulatory capital requirements and the review and approval of one or more committees in compliance with rules applicable to broker-dealers pursuant to the securities exchange act of 1934. when our capital is committed to capital markets transactions, after diligence is conducted, such transactions are subject to the review and approval of a capital markets underwriting committee. these transactions are also subject to risk tolerance limits. the risk tolerance limits establish the level of investment we may make in a single company or type of transaction, for example and are designed to avoid undue concentration and risk exposure. regulatory capital requirements also place limits on the size of securities underwritings the capital markets business can conduct based on quantitative measure of
assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items. aggregate balance sheet risk is monitored on an ongoing basis by the balance sheet committee referenced above.
with respect to the funds and other investment vehicles through which we make investments for our fund investors, kkr manages risk by subjecting transactions to the review and approval of an applicable investment committee, and then a portfolio management committee (or other applicable senior employees) regularly monitors these investments. before making an investment, investment professionals identify risks in due diligence, evaluating, among other things, business, financial, legal and regulatory issues, financial data and other information. an investment team presents the investment and its identified risks to an investment committee, which must approve each investment before it may be made. if an investment is made, a portfolio management committee (or other applicable senior employees) is responsible for working with our investment professionals to monitor the investment on an ongoing basis.
management of general business risk kkr has a risk committee comprised of senior employees from across our business segments and across business operations, and includes our chief administrative officer, our chief financial officer, and our general counsel. the risk committee monitors and evaluates kkr's general business risks, and is assisted by an employee dedicated to evaluating and monitoring market risk and coordinating such efforts across our businesses. the chief administrative officer, who also serves as the chairman of the risk committee, regularly reports to our co-chief executive officers and quarterly to the audit committee, which is the chief committee that monitors risk on behalf of the board of directors.
kkr's global conflicts and compliance committee is responsible for analyzing and addressing new or potential conflicts of interest that may arise in kkr's business, including conflicts relating to specific transactions and circumstances as well as those implicit in the overall activities of kkr and its various businesses and monitors compliance matters. our chief administrative officer, our general counsel and our chief compliance officer are members of this committee.
kkr's management committee is responsible for evaluating certain matters affecting the business of kkr. it consists of our co-chief executive officers, our chief administrative officer, our chief financial officer, our general counsel and other senior employees across our business segments and across business operations, and is chaired by our chief administrative officer. the management committee is responsible for approving the valuations of our level iii investments in private markets and public markets.
changes in fair value the majority of our investments are reported at fair value. net changes in the fair value of investments impact the net gains (losses) from investment activities in our consolidated statements of operations. based on investments held as of december 31, 2014, we estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of investments generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains (losses) from investment activities (except that carried interest would likely be more significantly impacted), regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. the impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to kkr & co. l.p. would generally be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a majority of the change in fair value would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our balance sheet investments and to a lesser extent our management fees. because of this, the quantitative information that follows represents the impact that a reduction to each of the income streams shown below would have on net income attributable to kkr & co. l.p. the actual impact to individual line items within the consolidated
statements of operations would differ from the amounts shown below as a result of (i) the elimination of management fees and carried interest, (ii) the gross-up of net gains (losses) from investment activities, in each case as a result of the consolidation of the majority of our private equity and credit funds and (iii) the inclusion of amounts attributable to kkr holdings l.p. in individual line items within the consolidated statement of operations.
based on the fair value of investments as of december 31, 2014, we estimate that an immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of investments would result in declines in net income attributable to kkr & co. l.p. in 2015 from reductions in the following items, if not offset by other factors:
10% decline in fair value of investments(1)   $9,353      (2)   $256,223      (3)   $524,707      (3)
an immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of investments would also impact our ability to earn incentive fees. since the majority of our incentive fees are earned at december 31st or june 30th of each calendar year and are not subject to clawback, a 10% decline in fair value would generally result in the recognition of no incentive fees on a prospective basis and result in lower net income relative to prior years where such incentive fees may have been earned.
represents an annualized reduction in management fees.
decrease would impact our statement of operations in a single quarter. with respect to carried interest, for purposes of this analysis the impact of preferred returns are ignored.
management fees our management fees in our private markets investment funds are generally calculated based on the amount of capital committed or invested by a fund, as described under "businessour segmentsprivate markets." accordingly, movements in the fair value of investments do not significantly affect the amount of fees we may charge in private markets funds. in the case of our public markets business, management fees are often calculated based on the average nav of the fund or vehicle for that particular period, although certain funds in our public markets segment have management fees based on the amount of capital committed or invested. to the extent that management fees are calculated based on the nav of the fund's investments, the amount of fees that we may charge will be increased or decreased in direct proportion to the effect of changes in the fair value of the fund's investments. the proportion of our management fees that are based on nav depends on the number and type of funds in existence. for the year ended december 31, 2014, the fund management fees that were recognized based on the nav of the applicable funds or separately managed accounts was approximately 25%.
publicly traded securities our investment funds and kkr's balance sheet hold certain investments in portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded. the market prices of securities may be volatile and are likely to fluctuate due to a number of factors beyond our control. these factors include actual or anticipated fluctuations in the quarterly and annual results of such companies or of other companies in the industries in which they operate, market perceptions concerning the availability of additional securities
for sale, general economic, social or political developments, industry conditions, changes in government regulation, shortfalls in operating results from levels forecasted by securities analysts, the general state of the securities markets and other material events, such as significant management changes, re-financings, acquisitions and dispositions. in addition, although our investments are comprised primarily of investments in portfolio companies whose securities are not publicly traded, the value of these privately held investments may also fluctuate as our level iii investments are valued in part using a market comparables analysis. consequently due to similar factors beyond our control as described above for portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded, the value of these level iii investments may fluctuate with market prices.
exchange rate risk our investment funds and kkr's balance sheet hold investments denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. those investments expose us and our fund investors to the risk that the value of the investments will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the currency in which the investments are denominated and the currency in which the investments are made. additionally, a portion of our management fees are denominated in non-u.s. dollar currencies. our policy is to minimize these risks by employing hedging techniques, including using foreign currency options and foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce exposure to future changes in exchange rates when a meaningful amount of capital has been invested in currencies other than the currencies in which the investments are denominated.
our primary exposure to exchange rate risk relates to movements in the value of exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and other currencies in which our investments are denominated (primarily euros and british pounds), net of the impact of foreign exchange hedging strategies. the quantitative information that follows represents the impact that a reduction to each of the income streams shown below would have on net income attributable to kkr & co. l.p. the actual impact to individual line items within the statements of operations would differ from the amounts shown below as a result of (i) the elimination of management fees and carried interest, (ii) the gross-up of net gains (losses) from investment activities, in each case as a result of the consolidation of the majority of our private equity and credit funds and (iii) the inclusion of amounts attributable to kkr holdings l.p. in individual line items within the consolidated statement of operations.
we estimate that an immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and all of the major foreign currencies in which our investments and fees were denominated as of december 31, 2014 (i.e. an increase in the value of the u.s. dollar against these foreign currencies) would result in declines in net income attributable to kkr & co. l.p. in 2015 from reductions in the following items, net of the impact of foreign exchange hedging strategies, if not offset by other factors:
10% decline in foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar(1)   $4,350      (2)   $21,597     (3)   $35,652     (3)
an immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and all of the major foreign currencies in which our investments were denominated would only marginally impact our ability to earn incentive fees since the majority of our funds in which we are entitled to earn incentive fees are denominated in u.s. dollars.
represents an annualized reduction in management fees.
decrease would impact our statement of operations in a single quarter. with respect to carried interest, for purposes of this analysis the impact of preferred returns are ignored interest rate risk valuation of investments changes in credit markets and in particular, interest rates, can impact investment valuations, particularly our private markets investments and may have offsetting results depending on the valuation methodology used. for example, we typically use a discounted cash flow analysis as one of the methodologies to ascertain the fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. if applicable interest rates rise, then the assumed cost of capital for those portfolio companies would be expected to increase under the discounted cash flow analysis, and this effect would negatively impact their valuations if not offset by other factors. conversely, a fall in interest rates can positively impact valuations of certain portfolio companies if not offset by other factors. these impacts could be substantial depending upon the magnitude of the change in interest rates. in certain cases, the valuations obtained from the discounted cash flow analysis and the other primary methodology we use, the market multiples approach, may yield different and offsetting results. for example, the positive impact of falling interest rates on discounted cash flow valuations may offset the negative impact of the market multiples valuation approach and may result in less of a decline in value than for those investments that had a readily observable market price. finally, low interest rates related to monetary stimulus and economic stagnation may also negatively impact expected returns on all investments, as the demand for relatively higher return assets increases and supply decreases.
interest income we and our consolidated funds hold credit investments, including clos that generate interest income based on variable interest rates. we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to investments that generate yield since a meaningful portion of credit investments held by us and our consolidated funds earn income based on variable interest rates. however, the contractual interest rate structure for a large portion of our credit investments bearing variable rates have "floors" which establish a minimum rate of interest that will be earned. in the current low interest rate environment, a large portion of the credit investments held by us and our consolidated funds are earning interest at the contractual floor and therefore, for these investments, a decrease in variable interests rates would not impact the amount of interest income earned. with respect to consolidated funds and clos, the impact on net income attributable to kkr & co. l.p. resulting from a decrease of a hypothetical 100 basis points in variable interest rates used in the recognition of interest income would not be expected to be material since (i) many variable rate investments are subject to floors as described above and (ii) a substantial portion of this decrease would be attributable to noncontrolling interests. with respect to credit investments held by kkr outside of the consolidated funds, all of the interest income earned inures to kkr & co. l.p., however a large portion of these investments are subject to floors as described above. accordingly, the impact on net income attributable to kkr & co. l.p. resulting from a decrease of a hypothetical 100 basis points in variable interest rates used in the recognition of interest income would not be expected to be material.
interest expense our consolidated funds have debt obligations that include revolving credit agreements, certain investment financing arrangements and debt securities issued by clo vehicles structured through the use of term loans and revolving credit facilities that accrue interest at variable rates. changes in these rates would affect the amount of interest payments that our consolidated funds would have to make. with respect to consolidated funds, the impact on net income attributable to kkr & co. l.p. resulting from an increase of a hypothetical 100 basis points in variable interest rates used in the recognition of
interest expense would not be expected to be material since a substantial portion of this increase would be attributable to noncontrolling interests. with respect to debt obligations held by kkr outside of the consolidated funds, as of december 31, 2014, kkr had $27 million of debt obligations outstanding that accrues interest at a variable rate. the impact on net income attributable to kkr & co. l.p. resulting from an increase of a hypothetical 100 basis points in variable interest rates used in the recognition of interest expense would be a decrease of approximately $0.3 million on an annual basis.
credit risk we are party to agreements providing for various financial services and transactions that contain an element of risk in the event that the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of such agreements. in these agreements, we depend on these counterparties to make payment or otherwise perform. we generally endeavor to minimize our risk of exposure by limiting the counterparties with which we enter into financial transactions to reputable financial institutions. in addition, availability of financing from financial institutions may be uncertain due to market events, and we may not be able to access these financing markets.

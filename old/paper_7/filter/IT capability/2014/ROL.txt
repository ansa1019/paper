the companys international business is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. repatriation of cash from the companys foreign subsidiaries is not a part of the companys current business plan.
the company maintains a large cash position in the united states while having no third-party debt to service. rollins maintains adequate liquidity and capital resources, without regard to its foreign deposits, that are directed to finance domestic operations and obligations and to fund expansion of its domestic business.
on october 31, 2012, the company entered into a revolving credit agreement with suntrust bank and bank of america, n.a. for an unsecured line of credit of up to $175.0 million, which includes a $75.0 million letter of credit subfacility, and a $25.0 million swingline subfacility. the credit agreement was amended on october 30, 2014 to extend the maturity date to october 31, 2018 and add three optional one year extensions. as of december 31, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit or under the swingline subfacility. the company maintains approximately $35.5 million in letters of credit. these letters of credit are required by the companys fronting insurance companies and/or certain states, due to the companys self-insured status, to secure various workers compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage. the company believes that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims.
the revolving credit agreement is guaranteed by certain of rollins' domestic-subsidiaries. the maturity date of the credit agreement is october 31, 2018, subject to up to three optional extensions of the credit agreement for one year each. revolving loans under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at one of the following two rates, at the company's election:
●                                                                   the base rate, which shall mean the highest of (i) the per annum rate which the administrative agent publicly announces from time to time as its prime lending rate, (ii) the federal funds rate, plus 0.50% per annum, and (iii) the adjusted libor rate
(which equals libor as increased to account for the maximum reserve percentages established by the u.s. federal reserve) determined on a daily basis for an interest period of one (1) month, plus 1.0% per annum.
●                                                                with respect to any eurodollar borrowings, the adjusted libor rate plus an additional amount, which varies between .75% and 1.00%, based upon rollins then-current debt-to-ebitda ratio. as of december 31, 2014, the additional rate allocated was .75%.
the revolving credit agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, certain financial covenants including covenants restricting the companys ability to incur certain indebtedness or liens, or to merge or consolidate with or sell substantially all of its assets to another entity. further, the revolving credit agreement contains financial covenants restricting the companys ability to permit the ratio of the companys consolidated debt to ebitda to exceed certain limits.

(2)                                            minimum pension funding requirements are not included as funding will not be required. the company is considering making contributions to its pension plans of approximately $3.3 million during 2015.
critical accounting policies the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require managements most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows:
accrual for termite contracts - the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the companys business practices. however, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims. accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the companys consolidated statements of financial position.
accrued insurance - the company self-insures, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers compensation and vehicle liability. the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self-insurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. the company contracts an independent third party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with managements knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. managements judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside managements knowledge and control. additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. the company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims. initiatives that have been implemented include pre-employment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, and pre-hire, random and post-accident drug testing. the company has improved the time required to report a claim by utilizing a red alert program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work on a limited-duty basis.
revenue recognition - the companys revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed. for certain revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month. in general, pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. for pest control customers, the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services. the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues.
termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. at the inception of a new baiting services contract, upon quality control review of the installation, the company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations, initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. a portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element. this portion is recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits. the allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price. there are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions. baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits.
revenue received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. for outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and historical information. the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term. as the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred. the company accrues for noticed claims. the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.
contingency accruals - the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. in accordance with the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 450 "contingencies," management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation. estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. however, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company's financial condition or results of operations. contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the company's consolidated statements of financial position.
defined benefit pension plans - in 2005, the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the rollins, inc. defined benefit plan, although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through june 2005. the company terminated the waltham services, llc salaried pension plan and all benefits have been settled via an annuity purchase or lump sum distribution in december 2012. the company also includes the waltham services, llc hourly employee pension plan to the companys financial statements. the company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with the fasb asc topic 715 compensation- retirement benefits, and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. with the assistance of the actuary, the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.
the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes, the investments strategy, and the views of our investment adviser. differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years. therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains or losses ultimately affects future pension expense. the companys assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 7.0% which is unchanged from the prior year.
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. in estimating this rate, the company utilizes a yield curve approach. the approach utilizes an economic model whereby the companys expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecast and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year. the economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds. the discount rate was 4.15% as of december 31, 2014 compared to 5.20% in 2013 and 4.17% in 2012. a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation.
as set forth in note 13 to the company's financial statements, included among the asset categories for the plan's investments are real estate, tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds. these investments are categorized as level 3 investments and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value. in accordance with accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2009-12 "investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent)," these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. the company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds' judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds' financial statements for reasonableness.
as of december 31, 2014, the defined benefit plans were under-funded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income decreased stockholders equity by $41.7 million before tax and $25.6 million after tax.
new accounting standards recently adopted accounting standards in february 2013, the financial accounting standard board (fasb) issued accounting standard update (asu) no. 2013-02, reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (asu 2013-02) to comprehensive income. the guidance requires disclosure of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding effect on the respective line items of net income. the provision of the new guidance was effective as of the beginning of our 2014 fiscal year. adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the companys reported results of operations or financial position.
in february 2013, the fasb issued asu no. 2013-04, liabilities (topic 405): obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date (a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force). this guidance requires an entity to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation within the scope of this guidance is fixed at the reporting date. this stipulates that (1) it will include the amount the entity agreed to pay for the arrangement between them and the other entities that are also obligated to the liability and (2) any additional amount the entity expects to pay on behalf of the other entities. the objective of this update is to provide guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements. the provision of the new guidance was effective as of the beginning of our 2014 fiscal year. adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the companys reported results of operations or financial position.
in july 2013, the fasb issued asu no 2013-11, income taxes (topic 740): presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. topic 740, income taxes, does not include explicit guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. there is diversity in practice in the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits in those instances. some entities present unrecognized tax benefits as a liability unless the unrecognized tax benefit is directly associated with a tax position taken in a tax year that results in, or that resulted in, the recognition of a net operating loss or tax credit carryforward for that year and the net operating loss or tax credit carryforward has not been utilized. other entities present unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss or tax credit carryforward in certain circumstances. the objective of the amendments in this update is to eliminate that diversity in practice. the provision of the new guidance was effective as of the beginning of our 2014 fiscal year. adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the companys reported results of operations or financial position.
recently issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2015 or later in april 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-08, presentation of financial statements (topic 205 and 360): reporting discontinued operations and disclosure of disposals of components of an entity. asu 2014-08 amends the definition for what types of asset disposals are to be considered discontinued operations, and amends the required disclosures for discontinued operations and assets held for sale. asu 2014-08 also enhances the convergence of the fasb's and the international accounting standard board's reporting requirements for discontinued operations. the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after december 15, 2014, and interim periods within annual periods beginning on or after december 15, 2015. the company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the company's reported results of operations or financial position.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): "revenue from contracts with customers" (asu 2014-09) which requires companies to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control rather than when companies have transferred substantially all risks and rewards of a good or service. asu 2014-09 is effective retrospectively for the annual or interim reporting periods beginning on or after december 15, 2016. the company is currently evaluating the impact of asu 2014-09 on its financial statements. we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the company's reported results of operations or financial position.
in january 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-01, income statement-extraordinary and unusual items (topic 225): income statement-extraordinary and unusual items (asu 2015-01) eliminate the gaap concept of extraordinary items. the new guidance eliminates the separate presentation of extraordinary items, net of tax and the related earnings per share, but does not affect the requirement to disclose material items that are unusual in nature or infrequently occurring. the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after december 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning on or after december 15, 2015. the company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the company's reported results of operations or financial position.

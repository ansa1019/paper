•   unaudited quarterly data
•   liquidity and capital resources
•   critical accounting policies and use of estimates
•   information concerning forward-looking statements dollar amounts are reported in millions, except per share dollar amounts, unless otherwise noted. we completed the spin-off of our health care business on october 31, 2014 (see further discussion below). as a result, the health care business is presented as discontinued operations on the consolidated income statement for all periods presented, and prior period consolidated income statements and related disclosures have been recast accordingly. the health care business' balance sheet, other comprehensive income and cash flows are included within our consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of stockholders' equity, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated cash flow statement through october 31, 2014. segment results have also been recast to present net sales and operating profit by segment on a continuing operations basis.
overview of business we are a global company focused on leading the world in essentials for a better life, with manufacturing facilities in 35 countries and products sold in more than 175 countries. our products are sold under well-known brands such as kleenex, scott, huggies, pull-ups, kotex and depend. we have three reportable global business segments: personal care, consumer tissue and k-c professional ("kcp"). these global business segments are described in greater detail in item 8, note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
•   invest in our brands, innovation and growth initiatives,
•   provide disciplined capital management to improve return on invested capital and return cash to shareholders.
•   we plan to grow our strong positions in personal care by leveraging our brands and providing innovations.
•   we plan to continue to shift our mix to faster-growing, higher-margin wiping and safety segments within kcp.
•   we executed our growth strategies in kci, with a focus on markets in china, eastern europe and latin america. net sales in kci grew mid-single digits in 2014, despite the negative 6 percent impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. kci net sales as a percentage of total company net sales was similar to the prior year at 42 percent.
•   in north america, we generated solid sales growth and launched innovations on several brands in 2014, including viva towels, goodnites youth pants, huggies baby wipes and our poise and depend adult care brands. in kci, we continue to innovate across our diaper portfolio. we continue to grow our feminine care brands and launch innovations in this category. we also experienced strong growth in net selling prices and volumes for adult care, baby wipes and kcp products in kci.
•   to help fund our investments in innovations and growth initiatives and to improve our profit margins, we are generating cost savings through several initiatives, including leveraging our global procurement organization and deploying lean principles. full-year cost savings from our ongoing program in 2014 were $320.
•   in 2014, we initiated a restructuring plan in order to improve organization efficiency and offset the impact of stranded overhead costs resulting from the spin-off of our health care business. the restructuring is intended to improve our underlying profitability and increase our flexibility to invest in targeted growth initiatives, brand building and other capabilities critical to delivering future growth. the restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of 2016, with expected workforce reductions in the range of 1,100 to 1,300, primarily impacting salaried employees. the restructuring is expected to impact all of our business segments and our organizations in all major geographies.
•   in 2014, we completed our strategic changes related to our western and central european consumer and professional businesses to focus our resources and investments on stronger market positions and growth opportunities. we exited the diaper category in that region, with the exception of the italian market, and divested or exited some lower-margin businesses, mostly in consumer tissue, in certain markets.
•   we continued to focus on generating cash flow and allocating capital to shareholders. in 2014, cash provided by operations was $2.8 billion, and share repurchases of kimberly-clark common stock were $2.0 billion. in addition, we raised our dividend in 2014 by 4 percent, the 42nd consecutive annual increase in our dividend. altogether, share repurchases and dividends in 2014 amounted to $3.3 billion.
•   on october 31, 2014 (the "distribution date"), we completed the spin-off of our health care business, creating a stand-alone, publicly traded health care company, halyard health, inc. ("halyard"), with approximately $1.7 billion in annual net sales. on the distribution date, each of our shareholders of record as of the close of business on october 23, 2014 (the "record date") received one share of halyard common stock for every 8 shares of our common stock held as of the record date. the distribution was structured to be tax free to our u.s. shareholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes. halyard's common stock trades on the new york stock exchange under the symbol "hyh." after the distribution, we do not beneficially own any shares of halyard common stock.
we are subject to risks and uncertainties, which can affect our business operations and financial results. see item 1a, "risk factors" in this form 10-k for additional information.
•   net sales increased 1 percent compared to the prior year. increases in organic sales volumes and net selling prices were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and lower sales in conjunction with european strategic changes and pulp and tissue restructuring actions.
•   operating profit and income from continuing operations decreased 13 percent and 23 percent, respectively, compared to 2013.
•   a charge related to the remeasurement of the venezuelan balance sheet decreased operating profit and income from continuing operations by $462.
•   diluted earnings per share in total and from continuing operations decreased 27 percent and 22 percent, respectively, compared to 2013. the decreases were primarily due to the charges mentioned above, along with lower equity income.

2014 organization restructuring in october 2014, we initiated a restructuring plan in order to improve organization efficiency and offset the impact of stranded overhead costs resulting from the spin-off of our health care business. the restructuring is intended to improve our underlying profitability and increase our flexibility to invest in targeted growth initiatives, brand building and other capabilities critical to delivering future growth.
the restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of 2016, with total costs anticipated to be $130 to $160 after tax ($190 to $230 pre-tax). cash costs are projected to be approximately 80 percent of the total charges. workforce reductions are expected to be in the range of 1,100 to 1,300 and primarily impact salaried employees. cumulative pre-tax savings from the restructuring are expected to be $120 to $140 by the end of 2017, and were $5 in 2014. the restructuring is expected to impact all of our business segments and our organizations in all major geographies.

2012. the restructuring resulted in cumulative pre-tax charges of $550 ($375 after tax) over that period. see item 8, notes 5 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.

liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations cash provided by operations was $2.8 billion in 2014 compared to $3.0 billion in 2013. the decrease was driven by higher tax payments and transaction costs for the health care spin-off, partially offset by lower payments for restructuring items.

•   the unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials, primarily superabsorbent materials, pulp, and utilities. although we are primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase
•   we will fund our defined benefit pension plans to meet or exceed statutory requirements and currently expect to contribute up to $100 to these plans in 2015.
•   other postretirement benefit payments are estimated using actuarial assumptions, including expected future service, to project the future obligations. based upon those projections, we anticipate making annual payments for these obligations of $52 in 2015 to more than $62 by 2024.
•   accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, deferred taxes and noncontrolling interests.
•   potential estimated redemption price of $46 for the redeemable preferred securities related to our subsidiary in central america as the timing of such redemption is unknown.
investing our capital spending was $1.0 billion in both 2014 and 2013. we expect capital spending to be $950 to $1,050 in 2015.
our short-term debt, which consists of u.s. commercial paper with original maturities up to 90 days and/or other similar short-term debt issued by non-u.s. subsidiaries, was $777 as of december 31, 2014 (included in debt payable within one year on the consolidated balance sheet). the average month-end balance of short-term debt for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $579, and for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014 was $572. these short-term borrowings provide supplemental funding for supporting our operations. the level of short-term debt generally fluctuates depending upon the amount of operating cash flows and the timing of customer receipts and payments for items such as dividends and income taxes.
in december 2014, we repaid $500 of redeemable preferred securities. see item 8, note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the securities.
at december 31, 2014 and 2013, total debt and redeemable securities was $7.0 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively.
in june 2014, we entered into a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in 2019. this facility, currently unused, replaced a similar facility for $1.5 billion, supports our commercial paper program, and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason.
we repurchase shares of kimberly-clark common stock from time to time pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. during 2014, we repurchased 18.0 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $2.0 billion through a broker in the open market, including the impact of approximately $600 from the spin-off of our health care business. in 2015, we plan to repurchase $0.8 billion to $1.0 billion of shares through open market purchases, subject to market conditions.
we account for our operations in venezuela using highly inflationary accounting. we have historically measured results in venezuela at the rate in which we transact our business, which in 2012 was 5.4 bolivars per u.s. dollar, and 6.3 bolivars per u.s dollar through much of 2013 and 2014. given the level of uncertainty and lack of liquidity in venezuela, in part due to recent declines in the price of oil, we remeasured our local currency-denominated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014 at the year end floating sicad ii exchange rate of 50 bolivars per u.s. dollar. this remeasurement resulted in a non-deductible charge of $462 in the consolidated income statement for the year ended december 31, 2014, with $41 recorded in cost of products sold and $421 recorded in other
(income) and expense, net. see additional information in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. at december 31, 2014, k-c venezuela had a bolivar-denominated net monetary asset position (primarily cash) of $59 and our net investment in k-c venezuela was $152, both valued at 50 bolivars per u.s. dollar. net sales of k-c venezuela represented approximately 3 percent of consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31, 2014 and approximately 2 percent of consolidated net sales for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012.
management believes that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending, payment of dividends, pension plan contributions and other needs for the foreseeable future. further, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the united states to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future.
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. the critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used. the critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances, pension and other postretirement benefits, deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments. these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors.
sales incentives and trade promotion allowances trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees, cooperative marketing programs, temporary price reductions, end-of-aisle or in-store product displays and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products. rebate accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of products expected to be sold to specific customers. our related accounting policies are discussed in item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. factors affecting the accruals for promotions include:
•   estimates of the quantity of customer sales, timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs generally, the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption, influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories.
employee postretirement benefits pension plans we have defined benefit pension plans in north america and the united kingdom (the "principal plans") and/or defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees. certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or, in certain countries, termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees. our related accounting policies and account balances are discussed in item 8, note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
changes in certain assumptions could significantly affect pension expense and the benefit obligations, particularly the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate the obligations:
22      kimberly-clark corporation - 2014 annual report on the fair value of assets. the variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a calculated value was used for plan assets.
as of december 31, 2014, the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately $2.9 billion. these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns, (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations, or (iii) other actuarial gains, including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the "corridor" as required. if the expected long-term rates of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 0.25 percent, the impact on annual pension expense would not be material in 2015.
•   discount rate. the discount (or settlement) rate used to determine the present value of our future u.s. pension obligation at december 31, 2014 was based on a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with cash flows that largely match the expected benefit payments of the plan. for the u.k. and canadian plans, the discount rate was determined based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities. each year's expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate to determine the pension obligations. if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, the increase in annual pension expense would not be material in 2015, and the december 31, 2014 pension liability would increase by about $209.
•   other assumptions. there are a number of other assumptions involved in the calculation of pension expense and benefit obligations, primarily related to participant demographics and benefit elections. as of december 31, 2014, we updated our assumptions for revised mortality projections that reflect longevity improvements of plan participants, resulting in an increase to future pension expense and to our consolidated benefit obligation.
pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate $100 in 2015. pension expense beyond 2015 will depend on future investment performance, our contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans.
other postretirement benefit plans substantially all u.s. retirees and employees have access to our unfunded healthcare and life insurance benefit plans. our related accounting policies and account balances are discussed in item 8, note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. changes in significant assumptions could affect the consolidated expense and benefit obligations, particularly the discount rates used to calculate the obligations and the healthcare cost trend rate:
•   discount rate. the determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above, and the methodology for each country is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate for that country's pension obligation. if the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, there would be no impact to 2015 other postretirement benefit expense and the increase in the december 31, 2014 benefit liability would not be material. the discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for our consolidated operations may appear different due to the unique benefit payments of the plans.
•   healthcare cost trend rate. the healthcare cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including our recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the healthcare marketplace, as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace. see item 8, note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the effect of a one percentage point change in the healthcare cost trend rate.
deferred income taxes and potential assessments as a global organization we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the u.s. and internationally. income tax related accounting policies, account balances and matters affecting income taxes are discussed in item 8, note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. changes in certain assumptions related to income taxes could significantly affect consolidated results, particularly with regard to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside the u.s. and uncertain tax positions:
•   deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances. we have recorded deferred tax assets related to, among other matters, income tax loss carryforwards, income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards and have established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets. these carryforwards are primarily in non-u.s. taxing jurisdictions
23      kimberly-clark corporation - 2014 annual report and in certain states in the u.s. foreign tax credits earned in the u.s. in current and prior years, which cannot be used currently, also give rise to net deferred tax assets. in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets, many factors are considered, including the specific taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward period, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction. a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
•   unremitted earnings. as of december 31, 2014, u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $8.6 billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the u.s. these earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely. however, they would be subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends, were lent to one of our u.s. entities or if we were to sell our stock in the subsidiaries. it is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred u.s. income tax liability on these unremitted earnings. we periodically determine whether our non-u.s. subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination, as appropriate.
•   uncertain tax positions. we record our global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which we operate. where we believe that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in our income tax returns. where treatment of a position is uncertain, a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter. these liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations. we currently believe that the ultimate resolution of matters subject to administrative appeals, litigation or other uncertainty, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

business outlook in 2015, we plan to continue to execute our global business plan strategies, which include a focus on targeted growth initiatives, innovation and brand building, cost savings programs and shareholder-friendly capital allocation. in 2015, we expect gaap earnings per share in a range of $5.46 to $5.72, based on the assumptions described below:
•   growth in volume, net selling prices and product mix is expected to be in the combined 3 to 5 percent target range, with a focus on personal care and kcp in developing and emerging markets.
•   we expect net sales to be negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of 8 to 9 percent, including an approximate 3 percent impact from exchange rate changes in venezuela. we also expect unfavorable foreign currency translation effects to negatively impact operating profit growth by 9 to 10 percent, including an approximate 4 percent decrease from exchange rate changes in venezuela. currency transaction effects are also anticipated to negatively impact operating profit.
•   we anticipate commodity cost deflation of $0 to $150.
•   we anticipate that advertising spending will increase somewhat as a percentage of net sales to support targeted growth initiatives, brand building and innovation activities.
•   our share of net income from equity companies is expected to be down somewhat due to lower earnings at kcm, driven by a weaker mexican peso.
•   we anticipate capital spending to be in a $950 to $1,050 range and share repurchases to total $0.8 to $1.0 billion, subject to market conditions.
•   we expect to contribute up to $100 to our defined benefit pension plans and to increase our quarterly dividend mid-single digits effective april 2015, subject to approval by the board of directors.

•   critical accounting estimates. this section identifies those accounting policies that are considered important to our results of operations and financial condition, require significant judgment and involve significant management estimates. our significant accounting policies, including those considered to be critical accounting policies, are summarized in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements.
overview we are a leading international beverage alcohol company with a broad portfolio of consumer-preferred premium imported beer, wine and spirits brands complemented by other select beverage alcohol products. we are the third-largest producer and marketer of beer for the u.s. market and the world's leading premium wine company. we are the largest multi-category supplier of beverage alcohol in the u.s., the leading producer and marketer of wine in canada, and a leading producer and exporter of wine from new zealand and italy.
our internal management financial reporting consists of two business divisions:  (i)  beer and (ii)  wine and spirits, and we report our operating results in three segments:  (i)  beer, (ii)  wine and spirits, and (iii)  corporate operations and other. in the beer segment, we have an exclusive perpetual brand license to import, market and sell in the u.s. the mexican beer brands. in the wine and spirits segment, we sell a large number of wine brands across all categories - table wine, sparkling wine and dessert wine - and across all price points - popular, premium, super-premium and fine wine, complemented by certain premium spirits brands. amounts included in the corporate operations and other segment consist of costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations and global information technology. the amounts included in the corporate operations and other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are therefore not allocated to the other reportable segments. all costs reported within the corporate operations and other segment are not included in our chief operating decision maker's evaluation of the operating income performance of the other reportable segments. the business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management and the structure of our internal financial reporting.
product recall in august 2014, we announced a voluntary product recall of select packages in the u.s. and guam containing 12-ounce clear glass bottles of our corona extra beer that may contain small particles of glass (the "product recall"). the product recall was a precautionary step after routine inspections in our quality control laboratory detected defects in certain bottles that could cause small particles of glass to break off and fall into the bottle. the potentially affected bottles came from a glass plant run by a third party manufacturer that supplies us with bottles. the third-party manufacturer contractually agreed to reimburse us for all costs associated with the product recall; accordingly, our results of operations for fiscal 2015 do not reflect any costs associated with the product recall.
strategy our business strategy in the beer segment includes the following:  (i)  continued focus on growing our premium mexican beer portfolio in the u.s. through expanding distribution for key brands, as well as new product development and innovation within the existing portfolio of brands; (ii)  completion of the required brewery expansion in mexico from 10 million hectoliters production capacity to 20 million hectoliters production capacity by december 31, 2016, with a goal to complete the expansion in june 2016; (iii)  incremental expansion of the brewery from 20 million hectoliters production capacity to 25 million hectoliters production capacity by december 31, 2017, to meet future demand expectations; and (iv)  continued focus on the sourcing of key production inputs, including agricultural, glass and other raw materials and energy, in order to provide flexibility, enable growth and improve profitability. see "acquisitions" below for additional discussion.
our business strategy in the wine and spirits segment is centered on continued focus on consumer-preferred premium wine brands, complemented by premium spirits. in this segment, we continue to focus on growing premium product categories. we have consolidated our u.s. distribution network in markets where it was feasible, which currently represents about 70% of our branded wine and spirits volume in the u.s., in order to obtain dedicated selling resources which focus on our u.s. wine and spirits portfolio to drive organic growth. throughout the terms of these contracts, we generally expect shipments on an annual basis to these distributors to essentially equal the distributors' shipments to retailers. in addition, we dedicate a large share of our sales and marketing resources to our u.s. focus brands as they represent a majority of our u.s. wine and spirits revenue and profitability, and have strong positions in their respective price segments.
marketing, sales and distribution of our products are managed on a geographic basis in order to fully leverage leading market positions. in addition, market dynamics and consumer trends vary across each of our markets. within our primary market in the u.s., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer, branded wine and spirits categories, with separate distribution networks utilized for our imported beer portfolio and our wine and spirits portfolio. within our next largest market, canada, we offer a range of beverage alcohol products primarily across the branded wine category. the environment for our products is competitive in each of our markets.
we remain committed to our long-term financial model of growing sales, expanding margins and increasing cash flow in order to achieve earnings per share growth, reduce borrowings and, as recently announced, pay quarterly cash dividends.
acquisitions glass production plant in december 2014, we completed the formation of an equally-owned joint venture with owens-illinois, the world's largest glass container manufacturer, and the acquisition of a state-of-the-art glass production plant that is located adjacent to our brewery in nava, mexico. the joint venture owns and operates the glass production plant which provides bottles exclusively for our brewery. the glass production plant currently has one operational glass furnace and plans are in place to expand it to four furnaces over the next four years. when fully operational with
four furnaces, this facility is expected to supply more than 50% of our glass requirements for the beer segment. we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of this vie and accordingly, the results of operations of the joint venture are reported in the beer segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. in addition, we also purchased a high-density warehouse, land and rail infrastructure at the same site.
beer business acquisition in june 2013, we completed the beer business acquisition for an aggregate purchase price of $5,226.4 million. the beer business acquisition resulted in the acquisition of:
•   the remaining 50% equity interest in crown imports;
•   all of the equity interests of a company which owns and operates the brewery and of a company which provides personnel and services for the operation and maintenance of the brewery; and
•   an irrevocable, fully-paid license to produce in mexico (or worldwide under certain circumstances) and exclusively import, market and sell modelo's mexican beer portfolio sold in the u.s. and guam as of the date of the acquisition, and certain extensions.
in connection with the beer business acquisition, we are required to build out and expand the brewery from 10 million hectoliters to a nominal capacity of at least 20 million hectoliters of packaged beer annually by december 31, 2016. in addition, an interim supply agreement and a transition services agreement were entered into in association with the beer business acquisition. the interim supply agreement obligates the supplier to provide us with a supply of product not produced by the brewery and the transition services agreement provides for certain specified services and production materials, both for a specified period of time. the associated agreements provide, among other things, that the united states will have approval rights, in its sole discretion, for amendments or modifications to the associated agreements as well as a right of approval, in its sole discretion, of any extension of the term of the interim supply agreement beyond three years. the beer business acquisition has positioned us as the third-largest producer and marketer of beer for the u.s. market and the largest multi-category supplier of beverage alcohol in the u.s.
the results of operations of the beer business acquisition are reported in the beer segment and are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. it is a significant acquisition that has had and will continue to have a material impact on our future results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
in october 2014, we announced an incremental 5 million hectoliter expansion of our brewery that will increase production capacity to 25 million hectoliters when completed. we currently expect this incremental expansion to be completed by the end of calendar year 2017.
mark west in july 2012, we acquired mark west which primarily included the acquisition of the mark west trademark, related inventories and certain grape supply contracts ("mark west"). the results of operations of mark west are reported in the wine and spirits segment and are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.
for additional information on these acquisitions, refer to note 2 of the notes to the financial statements.
results of operations financial highlights financial highlights for fiscal 2015:
•   our beer business acquisition continued to drive significant improvements within our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, including the continued realization of operating efficiencies and the strengthening of relationships with wholesalers and distributors.
•   our net sales increased 24% primarily due to the beer business acquisition and organic beer growth driven largely by strong consumer demand within the mexican beer portfolio.
•   operating income decreased significantly primarily due to the unfavorable overlap of the prior year nontaxable gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our preexisting 50% equity interest in crown imports, partially offset by the favorable overlap of the prior year impairment of nondeductible goodwill and intangible assets and the benefit from the beer business acquisition.
•   net income attributable to cbi and diluted net income per common share attributable to cbi also decreased significantly primarily due to the items discussed above combined with lower equity in earnings (crown imports).
references to organic throughout the following discussion exclude the impact of beer acquired in the beer business acquisition on a consolidated basis and branded wine acquired in the acquisition of mark west on a consolidated and segment basis, as appropriate. prior to the beer business acquisition, the results of operations of the beer segment were eliminated in consolidation as our preexisting 50% equity interest in crown imports was accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
unusual items management excludes items that affect comparability from its evaluation of the results of each operating segment as these unusual items are not reflective of continuing operations of the segments. segment operating performance and segment management compensation are evaluated based upon continuing segment operating income (loss). as such, the performance measures for incentive compensation purposes for segment management do not include the impact of these items.
as more fully described herein and in the related notes to the financial statements, the unusual items that impacted comparability in our results for each period are as follows:
cost of product sold net gain (loss) on undesignated commodity derivative contracts       $(32.7     )          $1.5             $-
amortization of favorable interim supply agreement                    (28.4     )          (6.0     )       -

loss on write-off of financing costs                                   (4.4     )             -             (12.5       )
unusual items                                                        $(87.2     )      $1,269.3             $(47.3      )
cost of product sold undesignated commodity derivative contracts net gain (loss) on undesignated commodity derivative contracts represents a net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of undesignated commodity derivative contracts, primarily driven by our diesel fuel derivative contracts. the net gain (loss) is reported outside of segment operating results until such time that the underlying exposure is recognized in the segment operating results. upon settlement, the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the undesignated commodity derivative contracts is reported in the appropriate operating segment, allowing our operating segment results to reflect the economic effects of the commodity derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility.
favorable interim supply agreement in connection with the beer business acquisition, a temporary supply agreement was negotiated under a favorable pricing arrangement for the required volume of beer needed to fulfill expected u.s. demand in excess of the brewery's capacity. amortization of favorable interim supply agreement reflects amounts associated with non-brewery product purchased from the date of acquisition which has been sold to our u.s. customers during the respective period.
inventory step-up in connection with acquisitions, the allocation of purchase price in excess of book value for certain inventory on hand at the date of acquisition is referred to as inventory step-up. inventory step-up represents an assumed manufacturing profit attributable to the acquired company prior to acquisition. flow through of inventory step-up was primarily associated with the beer business acquisition (fiscal 2014) and the mark west acquisition (fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013).
other losses other losses represent a loss on certain assets in connection with an earthquake in napa, california.
selling, general and administrative expenses transaction, integration and other acquisition-related costs transaction, integration and other acquisition-related costs were primarily associated with the beer business acquisition.
other gains (losses)
other gains (losses) consist primarily of a gain from an adjustment to a certain guarantee originally recorded in connection with a prior divestiture (fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2013), a net gain on the sale of and the write-down of certain property, plant and equipment (fiscal 2015), a prior period correction of previously unrecognized deferred compensation costs that were associated with certain employment agreements (fiscal 2014), and restructuring and related charges and credits associated with previously announced restructuring plans (fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013).
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets impairment losses consist of impairments of goodwill and certain trademarks related to our wine and spirits' canadian reporting unit.
gain on remeasurement to fair value of equity method investment prior to the beer business acquisition, we accounted for our investment in crown imports under the equity method of accounting. in applying the acquisition method of accounting, our preexisting 50% equity interest was remeasured to its estimated fair value resulting in the recognition of a gain in connection with the beer business acquisition.
loss on write-off of financing costs we recorded a loss on write-off of financing costs in connection with the amendment to the may 2014 credit agreement.

selling, general and administrative expenses increased $183.3 million primarily due to $134.2 million from the beer business acquisition and an increase in organic beer selling, general and administrative expenses.
beer increased $88.8 million primarily due to increases in general and administrative expenses of $44.5 million and advertising expenses of $44.1 million. the increase in general and administrative expenses is predominantly driven by higher compensation and benefit costs and higher information technology costs supporting the growth of the mexican beer portfolio, combined with an overlap of prior year foreign currency transaction gains with current year foreign currency transaction losses. the increase in advertising expenses is due largely to investment behind our mexican beer portfolio.
wine and spirits increased $18.7 million primarily due to increases in general and administrative expenses of $11.0 million and advertising expenses of $8.4 million. the increase in general and administrative expenses is predominantly attributable to higher compensation and benefit costs and higher consulting expenses supporting the
wine and spirits' branded portfolio. the increase in advertising expenses is due largely to a planned investment behind our branded wine and spirits portfolio.
corporate operations and other increased $9.3 million due to higher general and administrative expenses primarily attributable to the growth of our business.
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 17.9% for fiscal 2015 as compared to 18.4% for fiscal 2014 primarily due to the beer business acquisition and the associated lower fixed overhead and the decrease in unusual items, partially offset by the increase in organic beer selling, general and administrative expenses.

operating income decreased $937.5 million primarily due to the significant decrease in unusual items, partially offset by growth in our reportable segments as a result of the factors discussed above.
equity in earnings of equity method investees equity in earnings of equity method investees decreased to $21.5 million for fiscal 2015 from $87.8 million for fiscal 2014, a decrease of $66.3 million, or (76%). this decrease is primarily due to lower equity in earnings of crown imports as a result of the beer business acquisition and the consolidation of crown imports' results of operations from the date of acquisition.
interest expense interest expense increased to $337.7 million for fiscal 2015 from $323.2 million for fiscal 2014, an increase of $14.5 million, or 4%. the increase was driven largely by higher average borrowings, partially offset by a lower weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings, both primarily due to the issuance of the may 2013 senior notes and borrowings under our senior credit facility in connection with the financing for the beer business acquisition.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 was 29.1% and 11.8%, respectively. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 benefited primarily from the beer segment as well as additional foreign tax credits. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was favorably impacted by the beer business acquisition, primarily attributable to the recognition of the nontaxable gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our preexisting 50% equity interest in crown imports of $1,642.0 million, partially offset by the write-off of nondeductible goodwill of $278.7 million.
for additional information, refer to note 13 of the notes to the financial statements.
we continue to expect our effective tax rate for each of the next two fiscal years to be in the range of 30% to 32% primarily attributable to the impact of the beer segment. our tax rate includes taxes that may be payable if
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are repatriated to the u.s. we are currently assessing whether certain earnings may be permanently reinvested.
net income attributable to cbi as a result of the above factors, net income attributable to cbi decreased to $839.3 million for fiscal 2015 from $1,943.1 million for fiscal 2014, a decrease of $1,103.8 million, or (57%).

selling, general and administrative expenses increased $309.7 million primarily due to $260.3 million of selling, general and administrative expenses from the beer business acquisition, combined with increases in (i)  unusual items of $29.7 million, (ii)  wine and spirits of $13.4 million and (iii)  corporate operations and other of $6.3 million.
beer increased $51.8 million due to increases in general and administrative expenses, advertising expenses and selling expenses. the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to higher allocated information technology expense for beer (which was offset by a decrease in allocated information technology expense for wine and spirits) and higher compensation and benefit costs associated largely with higher annual management incentive expense. information technology expense is allocated to each of our segments to reflect utilization of central support services and costs associated with our information technology systems. the reallocation of information technology expense resulted from the beer business acquisition and the associated consolidation of beer's results of operations. the increase in advertising expenses is due largely to planned investment behind the mexican beer portfolio. the increase in selling expenses is due largely to increased headcount to support beer's growth.
wine and spirits increased $13.4 million due to an increase in selling expenses of $15.4 million and advertising expenses of $4.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses of $6.4 million. the increase in selling and advertising expenses is driven largely by a planned increase in spend behind the segment's branded wine and spirits portfolio. the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to the lower allocated information technology expense discussed above, partially offset by a number of smaller increases in certain general and administrative expenses supporting the wine and spirits' branded portfolio.
corporate operations and other increased $6.3 million due to higher general and administrative expenses primarily attributable to increased compensation and benefit costs associated largely with higher annual management incentive expense.
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 18.4% for fiscal 2014 as compared to 20.9% for fiscal 2013 primarily due to the beer business acquisition and the associated lower fixed overhead, partially offset by the higher unusual items.
wine and spirits                       637.8         650.2                        (2   %)

consolidated operating income       $2,437.7                $522.9                nm operating income increased $1,914.8 million primarily due to the significant increase in unusual items combined with the factors discussed above.
equity in earnings of equity method investees our equity in earnings of equity method investees decreased to $87.8 million for fiscal 2014 from $233.1 million for fiscal 2013, a decrease of $145.3 million, or 62%. this decrease is primarily due to lower equity in earnings of crown imports as a result of the beer business acquisition and the consolidation of crown imports' results of operations from the date of acquisition.
interest expense interest expense increased to $323.2 million for fiscal 2014 from $227.1 million for fiscal 2013, an increase of $96.1 million, or 42%. the increase was driven largely by higher average borrowings, partially offset by a lower weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings, both due primarily to the issuance of the may 2013 senior notes and borrowings under the 2013 credit agreement.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 was 11.8% and 24.9%, respectively. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was favorably impacted by the beer business acquisition, primarily attributable to the recognition of the nontaxable gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our preexisting 50% equity interest in crown imports of $1,642.0 million, partially offset by the write-off of nondeductible goodwill of $278.7 million. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was substantially impacted by the benefit from additional foreign tax credits.
net income attributable to cbi as a result of the above factors, net income attributable to cbi increased to $1,943.1 million for fiscal 2014 from $387.8 million for fiscal 2013, an increase of $1,555.3 million.
financial liquidity and capital resources general our ability to consistently generate cash flow from operating activities is one of our most significant financial strengths. our strong cash flows enable us to invest in our people and our brands, make appropriate capital investments, initiate a quarterly cash dividend program, and from time-to-time, make strategic acquisitions that we believe will enhance stockholder value and repurchase shares of our common stock. our primary source of liquidity has historically been cash flow from operating activities, except during annual grape harvests when we have relied on short-term borrowings. our principal use of cash in our operating activities is for purchasing and
carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable. however, we expect our reliance on short-term borrowings to fund our annual grape harvests to be reduced given the historical cash flow from operating activities from the beer segment. historically, we have used cash flow from operating activities to repay our short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures. we will continue to use our short-term borrowings, including our accounts receivable securitization facilities (see additional discussion below under "accounts receivable securitization facilities"), to support our working capital requirements.
we have maintained adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt. absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating activities and financing activities, primarily short-term borrowings, will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs, including our brewery and glass production plant expansions as previously discussed in the acquisitions section above.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased $254.8 million for fiscal 2015. this increase resulted primarily from an increase in cash provided by beer due largely to the timing of the prior year beer business acquisition combined with the strong growth in the mexican beer portfolio for fiscal 2015, partially offset by an increase in beer inventory levels to support the growth of the mexican beer portfolio.
net cash provided by operating activities increased $269.9 million for fiscal 2014. this increase resulted primarily from incremental cash from the beer business acquisition, partially offset by lower wine and spirits (due largely to timing of trade accounts payable payments) and lower corporate operations and other (predominantly attributable to higher interest expense payments associated with higher average borrowings for fiscal 2014).
investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased $3,847.9 million for fiscal 2015. this decrease resulted primarily from the beer business acquisition for fiscal 2014, partially offset by increased purchases of property, plant and equipment for fiscal 2015 primarily in connection with the beer business acquisition and the associated brewery expansion projects.
net cash used in investing activities increased $4,657.0 million for fiscal 2014. this increase resulted primarily from the beer business acquisition for fiscal 2014, combined with increased purchases of property, plant and equipment for fiscal 2014 primarily in connection with the beer business acquisition and the initial brewery expansion project.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased $3,793.4 million for fiscal 2015, primarily from the following:
•   fiscal 2015 proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $905.0 million primarily from the issuance of the november 2014 senior notes (used primarily to redeem our december 2007 senior notes) compared to fiscal 2014 proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $3,725.0 million from term loan borrowings under the 2013 credit agreement and the issuance of the may 2013 senior notes (used to fund a portion of the beer business acquisition);
•   fiscal 2015 principal payments of long-term debt for the repayment of the december 2007 senior notes of $500.0 million; and
•   fiscal 2015 payment of delayed purchase price arrangement of $543.3 million for the additional purchase price for the finalization of the final ebitda amount in connection with the beer business acquisition; partially offset by
•   fiscal 2015 proceeds from noncontrolling interests of $115.0 million in connection with the formation of an equally-owned joint venture for which we are the primary beneficiary.
net cash provided by financing activities increased $3,875.7 million for fiscal 2014, primarily from the following:
•   fiscal 2014 proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $3,725.0 million from term loan borrowings under the 2013 credit agreement and the issuance of the may 2013 senior notes (used to fund a portion of the beer business acquisition) compared to fiscal 2013 proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $2,050.0 million from the april 2012 senior notes, the august 2012 senior notes and proceeds from term loan borrowings under our then existing senior credit facility. a portion of the proceeds from the april 2012 senior notes and the term loan borrowings were used to repay the outstanding obligations under our then existing senior credit facility. proceeds from the august 2012 senior notes were intended to be used to fund a portion of the beer business acquisition; however, due to differences between the terms of the initial june 2012 purchase agreement and an amended february 2013 purchase agreement, we determined that the conditions for the release of the previously escrowed proceeds could not be satisfied and we redeemed the august 2012 senior notes in february 2013;
•   fiscal 2014 principal payments of long-term debt of $96.4 million compared to fiscal 2013 principal payments of long-term debt of $1.5 billion primarily for the repayment of outstanding obligations under our then existing senior credit facility and the redemption of the august 2012 senior notes;
the majority of our outstanding borrowings as of february 28, 2015, consisted of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, with maturities ranging from 2016 to 2024, and variable-rate senior secured term loan facilities under our 2014 credit agreement, with maturities ranging from 2018 to 2020.
we had the following borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization facilities:
remaining borrowing capacity february 28, 2015              april 22, 2015
revolving credit facility          $835.6                       $600.7
cbi facility                       $275.0                       $270.0
crown facility                     $100.0                       $130.0
the financial institutions participating in our 2014 credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization facilities have complied with prior funding requests and we believe the financial institutions will comply with ongoing funding requests. however, there can be no assurances that any particular financial institution will continue to do so in the future.
as of february 28, 2015, we also have additional credit arrangements totaling $483.4 million, with $207.3 million outstanding under these arrangements. these arrangements primarily support the financing needs of our domestic and foreign subsidiary operations.
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to the volatility of the interest rates associated with our variable-rate senior secured term loan facilities. in april 2012, we transitioned our then existing interest rate swap agreement to a one-month libor base rate versus the existing three-month libor base rate by entering into a new interest rate swap agreement which was designated as a cash flow hedge for $500.0 million of our floating libor rate debt. in addition, our existing interest rate swap agreement was dedesignated as a hedge. we also entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement for $500.0 million that was not designated as a hedge to offset the prospective impact of the newly undesignated interest rate swap agreement. as a result of these hedges, we have fixed our interest rates on $500.0 million of our floating libor rate debt at an average rate of 2.8% (exclusive of borrowing margins) through september 1, 2016.
we and our subsidiaries are subject to covenants that are contained in the 2014 credit agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness (including guarantees of indebtedness), additional liens, mergers and consolidations, the payment of dividends, the making of certain investments, prepayments of certain debt, transactions with affiliates, agreements that restrict our non-guarantor subsidiaries from paying dividends, and dispositions of property, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions and thresholds. the financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.5x and a maximum net debt coverage ratio of 5.5x, both as defined in the 2014 credit agreement.
our indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes contain certain covenants, including, but not limited to:  (i)  a limitation on liens on certain assets, (ii)  a limitation on certain sale and leaseback transactions and (iii)  restrictions on mergers, consolidations and the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets to another person.
as of february 28, 2015, we were in compliance with all of our covenants under both our 2014 credit agreement and our indentures, and have met all debt payment obligations.
for a complete discussion and presentation of all borrowings and available sources of borrowing, refer to note 12 of the notes to the financial statements.
common stock dividends on april 8, 2015, our board of directors declared an initial quarterly cash dividend of $0.31 per share of class a common stock, $0.28 per share of class b convertible common stock and $0.28 per share of class 1 common stock payable on may 22, 2015, to stockholders of record of each class on may 8, 2015. we expect to return approximately $240 million to stockholders in fiscal 2016 through cash dividends.
we currently expect to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock in the future, but such payments are subject to approval of our board of directors and are dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors, including those set forth under item 1a "risk factors" of this annual report on form 10-k.

(1)   interest rates on long-term debt obligations range from 1.9% to 7.3% as of february 28, 2015. interest payments on long-term debt obligations include amounts associated with our outstanding interest rate swap agreements to
fix libor interest rates on $500.0 million of our floating libor rate debt. interest payments on long-term debt do not include interest related to capital lease obligations or certain foreign credit arrangements, which represent approximately 0.7% of our total long-term debt, as amounts are not material.
(2)   other long-term liabilities include $10.1 million associated with expected payments for unrecognized tax benefit liabilities as of february 28, 2015, $2.4 million of which is expected to be paid in the less than one year period. the payments are reflected in the period in which we believe they will ultimately be settled based on our experience in these matters. other long-term liabilities do not include payments for unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $75.4 million due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. in addition, other long-term liabilities do not include expected payments for interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefit liabilities as amounts are not material. for a detailed discussion of these items, refer to note 13 of the notes to the financial statements.
(3)   total purchase obligations consist primarily of $5,377.3 million for contracts to purchase certain raw materials and supplies over the next thirteen fiscal years, $1,463.7 million for contracts to purchase equipment and services over the next three fiscal years and $469.0 million for contracts to purchase beer finished goods over the next ten months. for a detailed discussion of our purchase obligations, refer to note 14 of the notes to the financial statements.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
capital expenditures during fiscal 2015, we incurred $719.4 million for capital expenditures, including $587.3 million for the beer segment primarily for the brewery expansions. management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet current business needs. we plan to spend from $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for capital expenditures for fiscal 2016, including from $950 million to $1.05 billion for the beer segment associated primarily with the brewery and glass plant expansions. the remaining amounts consist of improvements of existing operating facilities and replacements of existing equipment and/or buildings. in total, over the next three fiscal year periods, we expect to spend between $1.2 billion to $1.55 billion for capital expenditures associated with the brewery and glass plant expansions. upon completion, the total spend for the brewery and glass plant expansions from fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2018 is estimated to be from $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion.
effects of inflation and changing prices our results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices. we intend to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices, subject to normal competitive conditions. there can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices. in addition, we continue to identify on-going cost savings initiatives.
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of our notes to the financial statements. however, certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management; as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. in applying those policies, management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. those estimates are based on our historical experience, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. on an ongoing basis, we review our estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business. our critical accounting estimates include:
•   goodwill and other intangible assets. we account for goodwill and other intangible assets by classifying intangible assets into three categories: (i) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization, (ii) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and (iii) goodwill. for intangible assets with definite lives, impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill, impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. we perform annual impairment tests and re-evaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the annual impairment test measurement date of january 1 or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist. the guidance for goodwill impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or to proceed directly to performing the two-step impairment test. in the first step, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is generally calculated based on an income approach using the discounted cash flow method supplemented by the market approach. if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, a second step is performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment we should record. in the second step, an implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets). the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill. the amount of impairment charge for goodwill is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. our reporting units include the beer segment and u.s., canada, new zealand and italy for the wine and spirits segment. in estimating the fair value of the reporting units, management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows, future revenues, future earnings and other factors. the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are based on historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans. these assumptions reflect management's estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are, therefore, subject to change as a result of changing market conditions. if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets. the recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis. no indication of impairment was noted for any of our reporting units, as the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value. based on this analysis, of all of our reporting units, the reporting unit with the lowest amount of estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value was the wine and spirits' u.s. reporting unit by approximately 18%. in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded an impairment loss of $278.7 million, in connection with the wine and spirits' canadian reporting unit. in fiscal 2013, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we concluded that there were no indications of impairment for any of our reporting units.
the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows calculation to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units in connection with impairment testing are: (i)  the discount rate, (ii)  the expected long-term growth rate and (iii)  the annual cash flow projections. as of january 1, 2015, if we used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of goodwill, then the changes individually would not have resulted in the carrying value of the respective reporting unit's net assets, including its goodwill, exceeding its estimated fair value, which would indicate the potential for impairment and the requirement to measure the amount of impairment, if any.
our other intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions. customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives. the useful lives of existing trademarks that were determined to be indefinite are not amortized. the
guidance for indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired or to proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. our trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the trademarks to their estimated fair value. the estimated fair value of trademarks is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method. the estimate of fair value is then compared to the carrying value of each trademark. if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the trademark, then an impairment charge is recorded by us to reduce the carrying value of the trademark to its estimated fair value. in estimating the fair value of the trademarks, management must make assumptions and projections regarding future cash flows based upon future revenues and other factors. the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans. these assumptions reflect management's estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are, therefore, subject to change as a result of changing market conditions. if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets. the recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we performed our annual review of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment. no indication of impairment was noted for any of our indefinite lived intangible assets as a result of our review. in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we recorded an impairment loss of $22.2 million, in connection with certain trademarks associated with the wine and spirits' canadian business. no indication of impairment was noted for any of our indefinite lived intangible assets for fiscal 2013.
the most significant assumptions used in the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives in connection with impairment testing are:  (i)  the estimated royalty rate, (ii)  the discount rate, (iii)  the expected long-term growth rate and (iv)  the annual revenue projections. as of january 1, 2015, if we used a royalty rate that was 50 basis points lower or used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual revenue projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives, then each change individually would not have resulted in any unit of accounting's carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value, except for the trademarks associated with the wine and spirits' canadian business. if we used a royalty rate that was reduced by an additional 50 basis points, then we would have recorded an impairment loss for the wine and spirits' canadian trademarks of approximately $3.6 million. no impairment loss would have been recorded for the wine and spirits' canadian trademarks if we used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher, an expected long term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower, or annual revenue projections that were 100 basis points lower.
•   accounting for promotional activities. sales reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in various customer incentive programs, including pricing discounts on single transactions, volume discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, coupons and rebates. certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the cost of those programs. the accrued liability for these programs is determined through analysis of programs offered, historical trends, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, sales and payment trends, and experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs that have been offered previously. if assumptions included in our estimates were to change or market conditions were to change, then material incremental reductions to revenue could be required, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.
•   accounting for income taxes. we estimate our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based upon various factors including, but not limited to, historical pretax operating income, future estimates of pretax operating income, differences between book and tax treatment of items of income and expense and tax planning strategies. we are subject to income taxes in canada, luxembourg, mexico, new zealand, the u.s. and other jurisdictions. we recognize our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax outcome of amounts
recognized in our results of operations. if necessary, we record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets if the realization of the asset appears doubtful. we believe that all tax positions are fully supported; however, we record tax liabilities in accordance with the fasb's guidance for income tax accounting. we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. in addition, changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our tax liabilities. these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. changes in current estimates, if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.
accounting guidance not yet adopted accounting guidance adopted on march 1, 2014, did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. for information on accounting guidance not yet adopted, refer to note 22 in our notes to the financial statements.

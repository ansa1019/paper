item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview and outlook colgate-palmolive company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers globally with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable.
to this end, the company is tightly focused on two product segments: oral, personal and home care; and pet nutrition. within these segments, the company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. these product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization's core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth.
operationally, the company is organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. the company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the company's sales and profitability. approximately 80% of the company's net sales are generated from markets outside the u.s., with over 50% of the company's net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of latin america, asia (excluding japan), africa/eurasia and central europe). this geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the company's exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.
the oral, personal and home care product segment is operated through five reportable operating segments: north america, latin america, europe/south pacific, asia and africa/eurasia, all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. the company, through hill's pet nutrition, also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling its products principally through authorized pet supply retailers and veterinarians.
on an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. these indicators include market share, net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. the monitoring of these indicators and the company's code of conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls.
to achieve its business and financial objectives, the company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth. the company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. to enhance these efforts, the company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers. growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the company's products.
the investments needed to support growth are developed through continuous, company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. through these initiatives, which are referred to as the company's funding-the-growth initiatives, the company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses. these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses and distribution and logistics, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through sku reductions and formulation simplification. the company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically oral care, personal care and pet nutrition.
as discussed in part i, item 1a "risk factors," with approximately 80% of its net sales generated outside the united states, the company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as political uncertainty in some countries, all of which could impact future operating results. for example, as discussed in detail below, the operating environment in venezuela is challenging, with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluations, high inflation and the decline in the price of oil, and governmental restrictions in the form of import authorization controls, currency exchange and payment controls, price and profit controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources. price controls, which became effective in april 2012, affect most products in the portfolio of the company's venezuelan subsidiary ("cp venezuela") and restrict the company's ability to implement price increases without government approval, which has limited the company's ability to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluations. in particular, the company has been and will continue to be impacted as a result of the significant devaluations of the venezuelan bolivar that occurred in 2010 and in february 2013, and the effective devaluations that have occurred in 2014 as a result of the introduction of a multi-tier foreign exchange system implemented during the first quarter of 2014. in addition, the decline in the price of oil may result in a reduced availability of u.s. dollars to fund cp venezuela's imports.
during the first quarter of 2014, the venezuelan government enacted several changes to venezuela's foreign exchange regime, introducing a multi-tier foreign exchange system creating three exchange rate mechanisms available to convert venezuelan bolivares to u.s. dollars. although the official exchange rate, as determined by the national center for foreign commerce ("cencoex"), remained at 6.30 bolivares per dollar, the exchange rate for foreign investments moved to the rate available on the sicad i (supplementary system for the administration of foreign currency) currency market. the venezuelan government also introduced an alternative currency market known as sicad ii. the company remeasures the financial statements of cp venezuela at the end of each month at the rate at which it expects to remit future dividends which, based on the advice of legal counsel, is the sicad i rate.
there continue to be ongoing impacts primarily related to the translation of the local financial statements and, to a lesser degree, the import of materials at the sicad i exchange rate as some imports may still qualify for the official rate. because the sicad i market is auction-based and auctions are held periodically during each quarter, the exchange rate available through sicad i may vary throughout the year which would cause additional remeasurements of cp venezuela's local currency-denominated net monetary assets and further impact cp venezuela's ongoing results.
cp venezuela continues to be able to settle certain of its u.s. dollar obligations for imported materials at the official rate of 6.30 bolivares per dollar and records the gains related to such transactions when the funds are authorized by cencoex and the liabilities are paid.
as part of the announcements during the first quarter of 2014, the venezuelan government also issued a new law on fair pricing, establishing a maximum profit margin of 30%. the new law does not apply to products that are subject to price controls, which includes most of the products in cp venezuela's portfolio. during the third quarter of 2014, the venezuelan government approved price increases for the majority of cp venezuela's product portfolio, which were implemented in the fourth quarter of 2014.
cp venezuela funds its requirements for imported goods through a combination of u.s. dollars obtained from cencoex and intercompany borrowings. cp venezuela's supply of u.s. dollars to fund imports has been limited and sporadic. cp venezuela was invited to participate in the sicad i currency market during the second and fourth quarters of 2014 and received less than $1 in each of those quarters at a rate of 10.50 bolivares per dollar and 12.00 bolivares per dollar, respectively. although accessible to the company, the company did not participate in the sicad ii currency market during 2014. cp venezuela's difficulty in accessing u.s. dollars to support its operations has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on the business. additionally, at times, production at cp venezuela has also been negatively impacted by labor issues within the country.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, cp venezuela represented approximately 3% of the company's consolidated net sales and approximately 1% of the company's consolidated operating profit excluding the impacts of the 2014 venezuela remeasurements, charges related to the 2012 restructuring program and certain european competition law matters and the sale of land in mexico (discussed below). at december 31, 2014, cp venezuela's local currency-denominated net monetary asset position, which would be subject to remeasurement in the event of further changes in the sicad i rate, was $549. this amount includes the devaluation-protected bonds issued by the venezuelan government. cp venezuela's local currency-denominated non-monetary assets were $310 at december 31, 2014 and included $235 of fixed assets that could be subject to impairment if cp venezuela is not able to implement further price increases to offset the impacts of continued high inflation or further devaluations, or if it does not have sufficient access to u.s. dollars to fund imports.
in february 2015, the venezuelan government announced changes in venezuela's foreign exchange regime. while the official exchange rate, as determined by cencoex, remains at 6.30 bolivares per dollar and the sicad i market (now known as sicad) is unchanged and the rate currently remains at 12.00 bolivares per dollar, the sicad ii market, discussed above, has been eliminated and a new, alternative currency market, the foreign exchange marginal system ("simadi"), has been created with a floating exchange rate determined by market participants. the simadi market became operational with an initial exchange rate of 170.04 bolivares per dollar. while the company will continue to assess the impact, if any, of these changes as the government of venezuela issues regulations to implement them, if cp venezuela is unable to obtain sufficient u.s. dollars from cencoex or the sicad market to fund its requirements for imported goods and instead needs to access the simadi market, it could significantly impact the company's operations in venezuela.
the company continues to actively manage its investment in and limit its exposure to venezuela. the company's business in venezuela, and the company's ability to repatriate its earnings, continue to be negatively affected by the difficult conditions described above. additional devaluations or the imposition of additional or more stringent controls on foreign currency exchange, pricing, payments, profits or imports or other governmental actions or continued or increased labor unrest would further negatively affect the company's business in venezuela and the company's ability to effectively make key operational decisions in regard to its venezuelan operations, both of which could result in an impairment of the company's investment in cp venezuela. at december 31, 2014, the company's total investment in cp venezuela was $955, which included intercompany payables of cp venezuela.
in the fourth quarter of 2012, the company commenced a four-year global growth and efficiency program for sustained growth. the program's initiatives are expected to help the company ensure continued solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses.
on october 23, 2014, the company's board of directors approved an expansion of the global growth and efficiency program (as expanded, the "2012 restructuring program"). the initiatives under the 2012 restructuring program continue to be focused on the following areas:
▪   optimizing global supply chain and facilities the board authorized the expansion of the 2012 restructuring program to take advantage of additional savings opportunities identified in all three areas.
cumulative pretax charges related to the 2012 restructuring program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be $1,285 to $1,435 ($950 to $1,050 aftertax). implementation of the 2012 restructuring program is expected to be substantially completed by december 31, 2016. savings, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be approximately $405 to $475 pretax ($340 to $390 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program. in 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company incurred aftertax costs of $208, $278 and $70, respectively, associated with the 2012 restructuring program. for more information regarding the 2012 restructuring program, see "restructuring and related implementation charges" below.
on september 13, 2011, the company's mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell to the united states of america (the "purchaser") the mexico city site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were located. the sale price is payable in three installments, with the final installment due upon the transfer of the property, which is subject to the company's satisfaction of certain closing conditions relating to site preparation by march 20, 2015. while these conditions are not expected to be fully satisfied by march 20, 2015, in which case the purchaser has several options under the agreement (including termination and the return to it of the first two installment payments), based on the transaction to date, the company believes that the transfer of the property is likely to occur in 2015. the company has reinvested the first two installments to relocate its soap production to a new state-of-the-art facility at its mission hills, mexico site, to relocate its commercial and technology operations within mexico city and to prepare the existing site for transfer. exit costs incurred during the project primarily relate to staff leaving indemnities, accelerated depreciation and demolition to make the site building-ready.
in 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company incurred aftertax costs of $3, $12 and $18, respectively, related to the sale of land in mexico and, in 2012, the company incurred aftertax costs of $14 associated with various business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives.
looking forward, the company expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging. while the global marketplace in which the company operates has always been highly competitive, the company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from local competitors and other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than the company does. such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion. additionally, the company continues to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high raw and packaging material costs, driven by foreign exchange transaction costs. while the company has taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, should they persist, they could adversely affect the company's future results.
the company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the company's strategic initiatives: engaging to build our brands; innovation for growth; effectiveness and efficiency; and leading to win. this focus, together with the strength of the company's global brand names, its broad international presence in both mature and emerging markets and initiatives, such as the 2012 restructuring program, should position the company well to increase shareholder value over the long term.
results of operations net sales worldwide net sales were $17,277 in 2014, down 1.0% from 2013, as volume growth of 3.0% and net selling price increases of 2.0% were more than offset by negative foreign exchange of 6.0%. organic sales (net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), a non-gaap financial measure as discussed below, increased 5.0% in 2014.
the increase in organic sales in 2014 versus 2013 was driven by an increase in oral care organic sales, with the toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash categories all contributing to growth. personal care and home care also contributed to organic sales growth due to strong organic sales in the bar soap and the fabric softener categories, respectively.
the company's share of the global toothpaste market was 44.4% for full year 2014 and its share of the global manual toothbrush market was 33.4% for full year 2014. full year 2014 market shares in toothpaste were up in europe/south pacific and africa/eurasia and down in north america, latin america and asia versus full year 2013. in the manual toothbrush category, full year 2014 market shares were up in north america, europe/south pacific and asia and down in latin america and africa/eurasia versus full year 2013. for additional information regarding market shares, see "market share information" below.
net sales for hill's pet nutrition increased 2.0% in 2014 to $2,255, as volume growth of 1.0% and net selling price increases of 3.0% were partially offset by negative foreign exchange of 2.0%. organic sales for hill's pet nutrition increased 4.0% in 2014.
the increase in organic sales in 2014 versus 2013 was driven by continued growth in the prescription diet category. the advanced nutrition and naturals categories also contributed to organic sales growth.
gross profit/margin worldwide gross profit decreased 1% to $10,109 in 2014 from $10,201 in 2013. gross profit in both periods included charges related to the 2012 restructuring program and costs related to the sale of land in mexico. excluding these items in both periods, gross profit decreased to $10,142 in 2014 from $10,248 in 2013, primarily due to lower sales ($84), as the growth in organic sales was more than offset by the impact of negative foreign exchange, and lower gross profit margin ($22).
worldwide gross profit margin decreased to 58.5% in 2014 from 58.6% in 2013. excluding the items described above in both periods, gross profit margin decreased by 10 basis points (bps) to 58.7% in 2014 from 58.8% in 2013. this decrease was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (290 bps), which included foreign exchange transaction costs, which were largely offset by the benefits from cost savings from the company's funding-the-growth initiatives (200 bps), higher pricing (70 bps) and cost savings from the 2012 restructuring program (20 bps).
worldwide gross profit increased 3% to $10,201 in 2013 from $9,932 in 2012. gross profit in both periods included charges related to the 2012 restructuring program and costs related to the sale of land in mexico. gross profit in 2012 also included costs associated with various business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives. excluding these items in both periods as applicable, gross profit increased to $10,248 in 2013 from $9,963 in 2012, primarily due to sales growth ($195) and gross profit margin expansion ($90).
worldwide gross profit margin increased to 58.6% in 2013 from 58.1% in 2012. excluding the items described above in both periods as applicable, gross profit margin increased by 50 bps to 58.8% in 2013. the increase was primarily due to cost savings from the company's funding-the-growth initiatives (220 bps) and higher pricing (30 bps), which were partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs (210 bps), which included foreign exchange transaction costs.

2012 restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2012, the company commenced the 2012 restructuring program. the program's initiatives are expected to help colgate ensure continued solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses.
the 2012 restructuring program is expected to produce significant benefits in the company's long-term business performance. the major objectives of the program include:
▪   becoming even stronger on the ground through the continued evolution and expansion of proven global and regional commercial capabilities, which have already been successfully implemented in a number of the company's operations around the world.
▪   simplifying and standardizing how work gets done by increasing technology-enabled collaboration and taking advantage of global data and analytic capabilities, leading to smarter and faster decisions.
▪   reducing structural costs to continue to increase the company's gross and operating profit.
▪   building on colgate's current position of strength to enhance its leading market share positions worldwide and ensure sustained sales and earnings growth.
on october 23, 2014, the company's board of directors approved an expansion of the 2012 restructuring program. the initiatives under the 2012 restructuring program continue to be focused on the following areas:
▪   expanding commercial hubs - building on the success of this structure already implemented in several divisions, continuing to cluster single-country subsidiaries into more efficient regional hubs, in order to drive smarter and faster decision making, strengthen capabilities available on the ground and improve cost structure.
▪   extending shared business services and streamlining global functions - implementing the company's shared service organizational model, already successful in europe, in all regions of the world. initially focused on finance and accounting, these shared services will be expanded to additional functional areas to streamline global functions.
▪   optimizing global supply chain and facilities - continuing to optimize manufacturing efficiencies, global warehouse networks and office locations for greater efficiency, lower cost and speed to bring innovation to market.
the board authorized the expansion of the 2012 restructuring program to take advantage of additional savings opportunities identified in all three areas.
cumulative pretax charges related to the 2012 restructuring program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be $1,285 to $1,435 ($950 to $1,050 aftertax). implementation of the 2012 restructuring program is expected to be substantially completed by december 31, 2016. these pretax charges are currently estimated to be comprised of the following categories: employee-related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (50%); asset-related costs, primarily incremental depreciation and asset impairments (10%); and other charges, which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities (20%) and the implementation of new strategies (20%). anticipated pretax charges for 2015 are expected to amount to approximately $330 to $385 ($245 to $285 aftertax). over the course of the 2012 restructuring program, it is currently estimated that approximately 75% of the charges will result in cash expenditures.
it is expected that the cumulative pretax charges, once all projects are approved and implemented, will relate to initiatives undertaken in north america (15%), europe/south pacific (20%), latin america (5%), asia (5%), africa/eurasia (5%), hill's pet nutrition (10%) and corporate (40%), which includes substantially all of the costs related to the implementation of new strategies, noted above, on a global basis. it is expected that, by the end of 2016, the 2012 restructuring program will contribute a net reduction of approximately 2,000-2,500 positions from the company's global employee workforce.
restructuring and related implementation charges in the preceding table are recorded in the corporate segment as these initiatives are predominantly centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance.

since the inception of the 2012 restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2012, the company has incurred pretax cumulative charges of $746 ($556 aftertax) in connection with the implementation of various projects as follows:
the majority of costs incurred since inception relate to the following projects: the implementation of the company's overall hubbing strategy; the consolidation of facilities; the simplification and streamlining of the company's research and development capabilities and oral care supply chain, both in europe; restructuring how the company will provide future retirement benefits to substantially all of its u.s.-based employees participating in the company's defined benefit retirement plan by shifting them to the company's defined contribution plan; the extension of shared business services and streamlining of global functions; and the closing of the morristown, new jersey personal care facility.
the following table summarizes the activity for the restructuring and implementation-related charges discussed above and the related accruals:
employee-related costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits and are calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. employee-related costs also include pension and other retiree benefit enhancements amounting to $5, $17 and $0 for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which are reflected as charges against assets within employee-related costs in the preceding tables, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets or an increase in pension and other retiree benefit liabilities (see note 10, retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements).
incremental depreciation is recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. asset impairments are recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. charges against assets within asset impairments are net of cash proceeds pertaining to the sale of certain assets.
other charges consist primarily of charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the 2012 restructuring program. these charges for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 included third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives of $65, $50 and $8, respectively, and contract termination costs and charges resulting directly from exit activities of $40, $34 and $3, respectively, directly related to the 2012 restructuring program. these charges were expensed as incurred. also included in other charges for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 are other exit costs of $82 and $25, respectively, related to the consolidation of facilities. other charges for the year ended december 31, 2013 also included a curtailment charge of $91 related to changes to the company's u.s. defined benefit retirement plans (see note 10, retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements).

liquidity and capital resources the company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, costs related to the 2012 restructuring program and stock repurchases). the company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.
cash flow net cash provided by operations was $3,298 in 2014, compared to $3,204 in 2013 and $3,196 in 2012. net cash provided by operations for 2014 increased due to strong operating earnings and a continued tight focus on working capital. the increase in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to strong operating earnings and a continued tight focus on working capital, partially offset by higher cash spending related to the 2012 restructuring program.
the company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). the company's working capital as a percentage of net sales was 0.8% and 0.7% in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
approximately 75% of total program charges related to the 2012 restructuring program, estimated to be $1,285 to $1,435 pretax ($950 to $1,050 aftertax), are expected to result in cash expenditures. savings from the 2012 restructuring program are projected to be in the range of $405 to $475 pretax ($340 to $390 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows. the anticipated pretax charges for 2015 are expected to amount to approximately $330 to $385 ($245 to $285 aftertax) and savings in 2015 are expected to amount to approximately $80 to $100 pretax ($60 to $75 aftertax). it is anticipated that cash requirements for the 2012 restructuring program will be funded from operating cash flows. approximately 60% of the restructuring accrual at december 31, 2014 is expected to be paid before year end 2015.
investing activities used $859 of cash in 2014, compared to $890 and $865 during 2013 and 2012, respectively. purchases of marketable securities and investments decreased in 2014 to $340 from $505 in 2013 partially due to a decrease in purchases of investments by the company's subsidiary in venezuela of local currency-denominated fixed interest rate bonds issued by the venezuelan government. in 2012, the company acquired the remaining interest in tom's of maine for $18. in 2011, the company's mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell the mexico city site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were located. during 2011 and 2012, the company received the first and second installments of $24 and $36, respectively, related to the sale of land in mexico. the final installment of $60 is due upon transfer of the property, which is subject to the company's satisfaction of certain closing conditions relating to site preparation by march 20, 2015. while these conditions are not expected to be fully satisfied by march 20, 2015, in which case the purchaser has several options under the agreement (including termination and the return to it of the first two installment payments), based on the transaction to date, the company believes that the transfer of the property is likely to occur in 2015. capital expenditures were $757, $670 and $565 for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns. capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to remain at an annual rate of approximately 4.5% of net sales, which is higher than the historical rate of approximately 3.5% primarily due to the 2012 restructuring program.
financing activities used $2,170 of cash during 2014 compared to $2,142 and $2,301 during 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase in cash used in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher principal payments on debt and higher dividends paid, which were partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuances of debt. the decrease in cash used in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to a lower level of share repurchases, partially offset by higher dividends paid and lower proceeds from exercises of stock options.
long-term debt, including the current portion, increased to $6,132 as of december 31, 2014, as compared to $5,644 as of december 31, 2013 and total debt increased to $6,148 as of december 31, 2014 as compared to $5,657 as of december 31, 2013. the company's debt issuances support its capital structure strategy objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital. during the fourth quarter of 2014, the company issued $134 of forty-year notes at a variable rate. during the first quarter of 2014, the company issued $500 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.75% and $500 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 3.25%. during the fourth quarter of 2013, the company issued $300 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.50% and $82 of forty-year notes at a variable rate. during the second quarter of 2013, the company issued $400 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 0.90% and $400 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.10%. during the third quarter of 2012, the company issued $500 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.95% and during the second quarter of 2012, the company issued $500 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.30%. the debt issuances in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were u.s. dollar denominated and were under the company's shelf registration statement. proceeds from the debt issuances in the first and fourth quarters of 2014 were used for general corporate purposes which included the retirement of commercial paper borrowings. proceeds from the debt issuance in the first quarter of 2014 were also used to repay and retire $250 of u.s. dollar denominated notes and €250 of euro denominated notes, both of which became due in the second quarter of 2014. proceeds from the debt issuances in the second and fourth quarters of 2013 were used for general corporate purposes which included the retirement of commercial paper borrowings. proceeds from the debt issuance in the second quarter of 2013 were also used to repay and retire $250 of notes due in 2013. proceeds from the debt issuances in the second and third quarters of 2012 were used for general corporate purposes which included the retirement of commercial paper borrowings.
at december 31, 2014, the company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $3,001 (including under the facilities discussed below) and could also issue medium-term notes pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. in november 2011, the company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility with a capacity of $1,850 with a syndicate of banks. this facility was extended for an additional year in 2012 and again in 2013. in 2014, the company entered into an amendment of this facility whereby the facility was extended for an additional year to november 2019 and the capacity of the facility was increased to $2,370. the company also has the ability to draw $165 from a revolving credit facility that expires in november 2015. in addition, the company has the ability to draw $20 from a new credit facility entered into during 2014, which expires in december 2015. commitment fees related to the credit facilities are not material.
domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $255 and $0 as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively. the average daily balances outstanding for commercial paper in 2014 and 2013 were $1,486 and $1,736, respectively. the company classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its line of credit that expires in november 2019.
weighted average interest rate           maturities           outstanding          weighted average interest rate        maturities          outstanding payable to banks                   1.9   %                            2015             $16                         2.2                 %              2014            $13
certain of the facilities with respect to the company's bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. the company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. see note 6, long-term debt and credit facilities to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the company's long-term debt and credit facilities.
the company repurchases shares of its common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. the share repurchase program approved by the board of directors on september 8, 2011 (the "2011 program") authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares of the company's common stock. the board authorized that the number of shares remaining under the 2011 program as of may 15, 2013 be increased by 100% as a result of the two-for-one stock split of the company's common stock in 2013. the board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the company's compensation and benefit programs.
aggregate share repurchases in 2014 consisted of 21.7 million common shares under the 2011 program and 1.5 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,530. aggregate repurchases in 2013 consisted of 24.6 million common shares under the 2011 program and 1.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,521. aggregate repurchases in 2012 consisted of 37.6 million common shares under the 2011 program and 1.2 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,943.
cash and cash equivalents increased $127 during 2014 to $1,089 at december 31, 2014, compared to $962 at december 31, 2013, most of which ($1,034 and $865, respectively) were held by the company's foreign subsidiaries. these amounts include $64 and $114 at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which are subject to currency exchange controls in venezuela, limiting the total amount of cash and cash equivalents held by the company's foreign subsidiaries that can be repatriated at any particular point in time. the company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs and, as part of this assessment, the company determines the amount of foreign earnings it intends to repatriate to help fund its domestic cash needs and provides applicable u.s. income and foreign withholding taxes on such earnings.
as of december 31, 2014, the company had approximately $4,900 of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no u.s. income or foreign withholding taxes have been provided as the company does not currently anticipate a need to repatriate these earnings. these earnings have been and currently are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the u.s. and, therefore, are not subject to such taxes. should these earnings be repatriated in the future, they would be subject to applicable u.s. income and foreign withholding taxes. as the company operates in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world and due to the complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to determine the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated.
the following represents the scheduled maturities of the company's contractual obligations as of december 31, 2014:
(1)   includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management's best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.
(2)   the company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2014 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. these purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.
long-term liabilities associated with the company's postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. the amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in "critical accounting policies and use of estimates" below) and voluntary company contributions. based on current information, the company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified u.s. pension plan in 2015. management also does not expect to make a voluntary contribution to the u.s. pension plans for the year ending december 31, 2015. in addition, total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending december 31, 2015 from the company's assets is estimated to be approximately $69.
additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. see note 11, income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
as more fully described in part i, item 3 "legal proceedings" and note 13, commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements, the company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
off-balance sheet arrangements the company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.
managing foreign currency, interest rate, commodity price and credit risk exposure the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the company's treasury and risk management policies. the company's treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.
the sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. see note 2, summary of significant accounting policies and note 7, fair value measurements and financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.
foreign exchange risk as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. the company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. see the "results of operations" section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each operating segment.
the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, other than those operating in highly inflationary environments, are translated into u.s. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders' equity. income and expense items are translated into u.s. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.
for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments (currently, venezuela), local currency-denominated non-monetary assets including inventories, goodwill and property, plant and equipment are remeasured at their historical exchange rates, while local currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company.
the company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.
interest rate risk the company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. the notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates.
commodity price risk the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, pulp, essential oils, tropical oils, tallow, poultry, corn and soybeans. the company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the hill's pet nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.
the company's open commodity derivative contracts, which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, resulted in net unrealized gains of $1 and $0 at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. at the end of 2014, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $2.
credit risk the company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the company's policy to contract with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations.
recent accounting pronouncements on may 28, 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") and the international accounting standards board ("iasb") issued their final converged standard on revenue recognition. the standard, issued as accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2014-09 "revenue from contracts with customers" by the fasb, provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance. the revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. the underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. the new standard also includes enhanced disclosures which are significantly more comprehensive than those in existing revenue standards. this new guidance is effective for the company beginning january 1, 2017, with no early adoption permitted. the standard allows for either "full retrospective" adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or "modified retrospective" adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements. while the company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard, it does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
on april 10, 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-08 "reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity." asu no. 2014-08 changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements. the new guidance is effective for the company on a prospective basis beginning january 1, 2015. this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment and make estimates. the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. the company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors.
in certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. the company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories.
▪   shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. the company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. accordingly, the company's gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. if such costs had been included in cost of sales, gross profit margin would have decreased by 770 bps, from 58.5% to 50.8% in 2014 and decreased by 750 bps and 740 bps in 2013 and 2012, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings.
the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves.
▪   in pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for u.s. defined benefit plans was 4.24%, 4.96% and 4.14% as of december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other u.s. postretirement plans was 4.36%, 5.24% and 4.32% as of december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. discount rates used for the u.s. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans. the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for u.s. plans was 6.80% as of december 31, 2014, 6.80% as of december 31, 2013 and 7.30% as of december 31, 2012. as the funded status of the u.s. postretirement plans improved in 2013, the company reallocated a portion of the assets of those plans from equity securities to fixed income securities and other investments. in determining the long-term rate of return, the company considers the nature of the plans' investments and the historical rate of return.
average annual rates of return for the u.s. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 11%, 10%, 7%, 5%, and 8%, respectively. in addition, the current assumed rate of return for the u.s. plans is based upon the nature of the plans' investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 53% in fixed income securities, 27% in equity securities and 20% in real estate and other investments. a 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the u.s. pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company by approximately $11. a 1% change in the discount rate for the u.s. pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company by approximately $4. a third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. this rate was 3.50% as of december 31, 2014, december 31, 2013 and december 31, 2012. refer to note 10, retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's pension and other postretirement plans.
▪   the assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. the assumed rate of increase for the u.s. postretirement benefit plans is 7.0% for 2015, declining to 5.0% by 2021 and remaining at 5.0% for the years thereafter. the effect on the total of service and interest cost components of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would decrease net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company by $7.
▪   the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. the company uses the black-scholes-merton ("black-scholes") option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. the weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended december 31, 2014 was $7.60. the black-scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of stock option awards. these assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards, expected volatility rate, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. while these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards. a one-year change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 8%. a 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 7%.
▪   goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, such as the company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually. the company performs either a quantitative or qualitative assessment to determine the fair value of its reporting units for goodwill and fair value of its indefinite life intangible assets. the asset impairment analysis performed for both goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management's strategic plans, sales growth rates, foreign exchange rates and the selection of a discount rate. qualitative factors, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance.
the estimated fair value of the company's intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value, except for the intangible assets acquired in the sanex acquisition in 2011, which were recorded at fair value. the estimated fair value of the company's reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value. therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets. asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2012 restructuring program requires management's best estimate of net realizable values. asset impairment analysis related to the fixed assets of the company's subsidiary in venezuela requires management's best estimate of future exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and the venezuelan bolivares, the rate of inflation in venezuela, the timing and amount of future selling price increases for products sold in venezuela, whether the company has sufficient access to u.s. dollars to fund imports.
▪   the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.
▪   legal and other contingency reserves are based on management's assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors. such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. while it is possible that the company's cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the company's financial position, or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. refer to note 13, commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's contingencies.
the company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. refer to note 2, summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company's significant accounting policies.
market share information management uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. references to market share in this annual report on form 10-k are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily nielsen, and internal estimates. all market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the company competes and purchases data.
market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information. we believe that the third-party vendors we use to provide data are reliable, but we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. in addition, market share information calculated by the company may be different from market share information calculated by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors.
cautionary statement on forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k may contain forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 or by the sec in its rules, regulations and releases. such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, organic sales growth, profit or profit margin growth, earnings growth, financial goals, the impact of currency devaluations and exchange controls, price or profit controls and labor unrest, including in venezuela, cost-reduction plans including the 2012 restructuring program, tax rates, new product introductions, commercial investment levels or legal proceedings, among other matters. these statements are made on the basis of the company's views and assumptions as of this time and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements, except as required by law. moreover, the company does not, nor does any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of those statements. the company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual events or results may differ materially from those statements. actual events or results may differ materially because of factors that affect international businesses and global economic conditions, as well as matters specific to the company and the markets it serves, including the uncertain economic environment in different countries and its effect on consumer spending habits, increased competition and evolving competitive practices, currency rate fluctuations, exchange controls, price or profit controls, labor relations, changes in foreign or domestic laws or regulations or their interpretation, political and fiscal developments, the availability and cost of raw and packaging materials, the ability to maintain or increase selling prices as needed, the ability to implement the 2012 restructuring program as planned or differences between the actual and the estimated costs or savings under such program, changes in the policies of retail trade customers, the ability to continue lowering costs and the uncertainty of the outcome of legal proceedings, whether or not the company believes they have merit. for information about these and other factors that could impact the company's business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, refer to part i, item 1a "risk factors."
